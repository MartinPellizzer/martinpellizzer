<p>Robinia halodendron, commonly known as the coastal locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in woody pods that split open to release the seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Robinia halodendron is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments.</p>
