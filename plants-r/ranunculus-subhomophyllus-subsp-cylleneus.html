<p>Ranunculus subhomophyllus subsp.</p>
<p>cylleneus, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a prominent central stigma, characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
