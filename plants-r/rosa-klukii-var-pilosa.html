                    <h1>Rosa klukii var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Rosa klukii var. pilosa, commonly known as the pilose rose, is a variant of the Klukii rose native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet "pilosa.". The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other rose varieties.</p>
