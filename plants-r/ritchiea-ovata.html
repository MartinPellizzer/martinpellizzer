                    <h1>Ritchiea ovata</h1>
<p>Ritchiea ovata, commonly known as the ovate-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, ovate, dark green leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being clustered at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging from the crown. Ritchiea ovata is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range.</p>
