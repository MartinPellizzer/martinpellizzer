<p>Rubus × marcailhoanus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry-loganberry.</p>
<p>This plant is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. It is a perennial shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces large, sweet-tart berries that are often cultivated for their flavor and culinary use.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the Rubus family.</p>
