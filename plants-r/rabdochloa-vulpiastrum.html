                    <h1>Rabdochloa vulpiastrum</h1>
<p>Rabdochloa vulpiastrum, commonly known as the foxglove fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Rabdochloa vulpiastrum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
