                    <h1>Rheedia cincta</h1>
<p>Rheedia cincta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Rheedia cincta is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been used historically in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
