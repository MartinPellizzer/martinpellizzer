                    <h1>Rhinanthus serotinus var. major</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus serotinus var. major, commonly known as the late yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit, where it derives nutrients from the roots of grasses and other plants. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows, often found in areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
