<p>Ranunculus alismoides, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features showy, yellow flowers with five to ten petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. The plant has slender, aquatic or semi-aquatic stems that can grow up to 30 inches tall, often floating on the surface of water. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a spiral along the stem, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>Ranunculus alismoides thrives in moist environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
