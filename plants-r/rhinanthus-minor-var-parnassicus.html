                    <h1>Rhinanthus minor var. parnassicus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus minor var. parnassicus, commonly known as the Parnassian red clover, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow-orange flowers. This variant is distinguished by its more vibrant coloration and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical Rhinanthus minor. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
