<p>Rostraria glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered rostraria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Rostraria glabriflora is known for its unique rostellum, a small, elongated structure at the base of the flower, which is a distinguishing feature.</p>
