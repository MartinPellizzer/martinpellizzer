                    <h1>Ranunculus stagnalis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus stagnalis, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, upright stem with alternate, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
