                    <h1>Ranunculus glacialis var. holosericeus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus glacialis var. holosericeus, commonly known as the glacier buttercup, is a rare and delicate alpine plant characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers with 5 to 13 petals.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs, providing insulation against harsh weather. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its arctic and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique floral structure and its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
