                    <h1>Rosa pomifera f. setulifera</h1>
<p>Rosa pomifera f. setulifera, commonly known as the hairy-fruited rose, is a unique botanical variant characterized by its distinctive, hairy fruits.</p>
<p>This form of Rosa pomifera is notable for its large, fleshy, red or orange berries that resemble small apples, a feature that sets it apart from typical roses. The plant typically grows as a shrub with arching stems and compound leaves, often found in temperate regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unusual fruiting habit.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its fruits is due to fine, glandular hairs that cover the surface.</p>
