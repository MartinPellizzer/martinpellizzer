                    <h1>Rumex × peisonis</h1>
<p>Rumex × peisonis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetoglossus (broadleaf sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a reddish coloration on the underside, which is a trait inherited from its parent species. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Rumex × peisonis exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the genetic contributions of its parents.</p>
