                    <h1>Reaumuria hirtella var. brachylepis</h1>
<p>Reaumuria hirtella var. brachylepis, commonly known as the short-stalked sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations, including deep root systems and waxy leaf surfaces, enable it to thrive in sandy soils with limited moisture.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
