<p>Rhinanthus minor subsp.</p>
<p>perrieri, commonly known as the lesser yellow-rattle, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of grasses and other plants. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its subspecies perrieri is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies due to its parasitic nature.</p>
