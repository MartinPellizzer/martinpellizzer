<p>Rhodostegiella, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and small, clustered flowers. The plants typically grow in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Rhodostegiella species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them valuable subjects for both horticultural study and conservation efforts.</p>
