                    <h1>Rafflesia aurantia</h1>
<p>Rafflesia aurantia, commonly known as the giant padlock flower, is a parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its vivid red petals are covered in a waxy coating and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>The flower blooms briefly, typically for only a few days, before withering and dying.</p>
