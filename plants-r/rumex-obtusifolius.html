                    <h1>Rumex obtusifolius</h1>
<p>Rumex obtusifolius, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are surrounded by broad, leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies due to their astringent properties.</p>
