<p>Rebutia einsteinii f. schmiedcheniana, commonly known as the Schmiedcheniana Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of short, cylindrical stems that are typically greenish-gray with a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The varietal form f. schmiedcheniana is distinguished by its unique coloration and growth habit compared to the typical form of Rebutia einsteinii.</p>
