                    <h1>Rottboellia barbata</h1>
<p>Rottboellia barbata, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, bristly husk, which aids in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Rottboellia barbata is often considered a weed but has ecological and agricultural significance in its native habitats.</p>
