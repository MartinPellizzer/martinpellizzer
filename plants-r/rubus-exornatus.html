<p>Rubus exornatus, commonly known as the ornate raspberry.</p>
<p>It is a species of bramble native to eastern North America, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are typically edible, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other raspberry varieties. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Rubus exornatus plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals, by providing food and shelter.</p>
