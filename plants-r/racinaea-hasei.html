<p>Racinaea hasei, commonly known as the Hasei's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear pale pink or white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, and the plant produces small, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Racinaea hasei is considered a conservation concern.</p>
