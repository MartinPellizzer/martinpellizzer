                    <h1>Ritchiea wilczekiana</h1>
<p>Ritchiea wilczekiana, commonly known as the Wilczek's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ritchiea wilczekiana is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
