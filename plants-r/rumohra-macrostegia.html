<p>Rumohra macrostegia, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface.
