<p>Ranunculus delitescens, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a delicate aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, pale yellow flowers with five petals that often appear to be translucent or ghostly in appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically floating or submersed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ephemeral blooms, which often last only a short time before fading.</p>
