                    <h1>Rubus tereticaulis microgene schnetzleri</h1>
<p>Rubus tereticaulis microgene schnetzleri, commonly known as the Schneetzler's trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, dark purple leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical studies.</p>
