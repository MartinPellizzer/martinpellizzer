                    <h1>Rhagadiolus stellatus var. leiocarpus</h1>
<p>Rhagadiolus stellatus var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the star-shaped leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive rosette of fleshy, star-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are followed by unique, spherical seed pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
