                    <h1>Rhynchospora fujiiana var. scabrista</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora fujiiana var. scabrista, commonly known as the scabrous tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense tussocks.</p>
<p>The variety scabrista is distinguished by its rough, scabrous texture on the leaf surfaces, contributing to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
