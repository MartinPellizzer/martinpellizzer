                    <h1>Rostellularia ardjunensis</h1>
<p>Rostellularia ardjunensis, commonly known as the Madras ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the monsoon season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
