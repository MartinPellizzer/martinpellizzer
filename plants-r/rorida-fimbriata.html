<p>Rorida fimbriata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and ornamental plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round visual interest in gardens or indoor settings.</p>
