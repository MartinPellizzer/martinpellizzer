                    <h1>Roella bryoides</h1>
<p>Roella bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like sea lettuce, is a green alga that thrives in marine environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, green to brown tufts that resemble moss, often found on rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters. The plant has a simple, branched structure with a thin, gelatinous cell wall that helps it retain moisture. It reproduces through the release of motile zoospores, which develop into new thallus structures.</p>
<p>Roella bryoides plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
