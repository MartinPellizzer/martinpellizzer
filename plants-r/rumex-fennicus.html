                    <h1>Rumex fennicus</h1>
<p>Rumex fennicus, commonly known as the northern dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
