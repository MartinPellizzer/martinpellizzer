                    <h1>Rhinactinidia</h1>
<p>Rhinactinidia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's botanical features include long, thin roots and a single, waxy, white flower that blooms in late summer. It has no leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Rhinactinidia is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
