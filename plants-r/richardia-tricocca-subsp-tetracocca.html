<p>Richardia tricocca subsp.</p>
<p>tetracocca, commonly known as the four-lobed richardia, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, typically in shades of pink or red. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
