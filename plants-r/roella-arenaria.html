<p>Roella arenaria, commonly known as the sand lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Australia, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the early spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss, and its roots are shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface.</p>
<p>Roella arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
