<p>Rhytidophyllum exsertum subsp.</p>
<p>villosulum, commonly known as the hairy leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, spore-bearing cones, typical of cycads, and has a slow growth rate, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and over-collection, highlighting the need for protective measures.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is of significant interest for its evolutionary and ecological importance.</p>
