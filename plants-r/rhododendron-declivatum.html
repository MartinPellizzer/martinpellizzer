                    <h1>Rhododendron declivatum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron declivatum, commonly known as the alpine azalea, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or forested areas. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Rhododendron declivatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
