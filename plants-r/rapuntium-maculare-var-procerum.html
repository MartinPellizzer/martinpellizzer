                    <h1>Rapuntium maculare var. procerum</h1>
<p>Rapuntium maculare var. procerum, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
