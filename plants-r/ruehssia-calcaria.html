<p>Ruehssia calcaria, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns that resemble carved stone, hence its common name. Its growth habit is typically compact, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Ruehssia calcaria is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
