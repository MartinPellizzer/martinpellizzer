                    <h1>Rumex conglomeratus</h1>
<p>Rumex conglomeratus, commonly known as clustered sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and alternate leaves that are heart-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them somewhat tart and potentially irritant.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
