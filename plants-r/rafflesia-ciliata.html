                    <h1>Rafflesia ciliata</h1>
<p>Rafflesia ciliata, commonly known as the Ciliata Rafflesia, is a parasitic plant found in the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is famous for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flower has a distinctive appearance, with a deep red color and a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts flies for pollination.</p>
<p>Despite its dramatic blooms, Rafflesia ciliata is rare and highly sensitive to habitat destruction.</p>
