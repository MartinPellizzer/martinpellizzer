                    <h1>Rubus macrostachys var. pumiliformis</h1>
<p>Rubus macrostachys var. pumiliformis, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry shrub, is a compact, thorny shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically consumed by wildlife. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its stems are covered in dense, stiff bristles, and it thrives in moist, woodland habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is often confused with other Rubus species due to its similar appearance but is distinguished by its smaller size and specific geographic distribution.</p>
