                    <h1>Rhodax marifolius</h1>
<p>Rhodax marifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night and emit a sweet fragrance. The plant has silver-green foliage with a velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Rhodax marifolius plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats.</p>
