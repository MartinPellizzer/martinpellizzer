<p>Rubus jactabundus, commonly known as the wandering raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart and less flavorful compared to other raspberries. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Rubus jactabundus plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects, due to its flowering and fruiting habits.</p>
