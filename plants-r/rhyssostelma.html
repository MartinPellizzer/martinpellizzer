                    <h1>Rhyssostelma</h1>
<p>Rhyssostelma, commonly known as the star-shaped fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Rhyssostelma species are characterized by their rosette-like arrangement of leaves, which form a central cup to collect water. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spiral pattern, and are usually borne on short stalks.</p>
<p>They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated as houseplants due to their unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
