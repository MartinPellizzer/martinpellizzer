<p>Rubus pannosus f. holosericeus, commonly known as the silky bramble, is a variant of the common bramble, characterized by its dense, silken-soft pubescence on both stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and appear in clusters, followed by red, aggregate fruits that are edible but often tart.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal interest.</p>
