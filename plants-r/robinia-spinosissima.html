<p>Robinia spinosissima, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound, trifoliate leaves and bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces long, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is known for its thorned stems and its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy and adaptable species.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production.</p>
