                    <h1>Rhynchosia calobotrya</h1>
<p>Rhynchosia calobotrya, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fallows and roadsides.</p>
<p>Rhynchosia calobotrya is also valued for its seeds, which are used as a protein-rich food source in some regions.</p>
