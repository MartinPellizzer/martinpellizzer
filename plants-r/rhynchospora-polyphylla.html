<p>Rhynchospora polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in summer. The plant is characterized by its numerous, thread-like leaves that arise from the base, giving it its common name. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Rhynchospora polyphylla is typically found in shallow water or saturated soils, making it a key indicator species for wetland health.</p>
