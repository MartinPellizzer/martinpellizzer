<p>Restrepia aristulifera f. aristulifera, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and delicate nature, it is a prized but challenging plant for cultivation.</p>
