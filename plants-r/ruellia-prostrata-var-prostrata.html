<p>Ruellia prostrata var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping ruellia, is a low-growing, spreading perennial herb native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in wetland restoration projects.</p>
