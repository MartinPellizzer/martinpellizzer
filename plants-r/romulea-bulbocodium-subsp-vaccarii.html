<p>Romulea bulbocodium subsp.</p>
<p>vaccarii, commonly known as the Vaccarii spring orchid, is a perennial geophyte native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a bulb-like structure that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>

<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
