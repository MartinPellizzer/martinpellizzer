                    <h1>Rosa gallica var. centifolia</h1>
<p>Rosa gallica var. centifolia, commonly known as the centifolia rose, is a fragrant, old-world shrub native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its numerous, flat-topped clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in perfumery and culinary applications.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its showy, hundred-petaled appearance, though the flowers may not always reach that level of complexity.</p>
