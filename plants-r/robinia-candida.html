<p>Robinia candida, commonly known as the white robinia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in racemes during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds, contributing to its propagation.</p>
<p>Robinia candida is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
