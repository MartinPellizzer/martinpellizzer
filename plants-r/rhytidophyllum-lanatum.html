                    <h1>Rhytidophyllum lanatum</h1>
<p>Rhytidophyllum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly rhytidophyllum, is a unique plant species characterized by its dense, hairy foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South Africa, where it has adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant's leaves are typically thick and covered in a fine, white pubescence that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
