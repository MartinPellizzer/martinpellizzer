                    <h1>Rubus × axensis</h1>

<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, typically producing dark red to black berries that are larger and more flavorful than those of its parents. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
