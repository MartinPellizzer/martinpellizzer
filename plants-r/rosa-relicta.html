                    <h1>Rosa relicta</h1>
<p>Rosa relicta, commonly known as the relic rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, pale pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. The plant is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with finely serrated margins, and its fruits are small, aggregate berries.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa relicta is considered a conservation concern.</p>
