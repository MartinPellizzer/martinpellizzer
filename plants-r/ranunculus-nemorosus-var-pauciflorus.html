                    <h1>Ranunculus nemorosus var. pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus nemorosus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of palmately lobed, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers with five to seven petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
