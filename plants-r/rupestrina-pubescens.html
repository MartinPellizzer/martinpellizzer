                    <h1>Rupestrina pubescens</h1>
<p>Rupestrina pubescens, commonly known as the hairy rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide additional protection from herbivores and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Rupestrina pubescens is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
