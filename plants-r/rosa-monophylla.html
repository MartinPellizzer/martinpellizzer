<p>Rosa monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf rose, is a species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single leaflet on each leaf, which distinguishes it from other rose species. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Rosa monophylla is considered a conservation concern.</p>
