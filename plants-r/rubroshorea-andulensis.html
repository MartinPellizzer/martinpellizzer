<p>Rubroshorea andulensis, commonly known as the Andulensis Flamebark, is a rare shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red bark, which becomes more pronounced with age, and its dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of primary forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
