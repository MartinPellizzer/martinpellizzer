                    <h1>Rhinanthus aristatus var. velebiticus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus aristatus var. velebiticus, commonly known as the Velebit yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats like grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
