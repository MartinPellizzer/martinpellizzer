                    <h1>Rumex × finitimus</h1>
<p>Rumex × finitimus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetobipinus.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be cooked before consumption.</p>
<p>The hybrid is often found in the wild in regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
