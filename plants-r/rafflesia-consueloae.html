                    <h1>Rafflesia consueloae</h1>
<p>Rafflesia consueloae, commonly known as the Consuelo's corpse flower, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts carrion flies for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia consueloae is classified as critically endangered, making it a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
