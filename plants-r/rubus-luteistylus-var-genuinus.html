                    <h1>Rubus luteistylus var. genuinus</h1>
<p>Rubus luteistylus var. genuinus, commonly known as the golden-styled raspberry, is a rare and less commonly studied variant of the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellowish stigmas, which distinguish it from other raspberry species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils, often in forested areas. Its flowers are usually pink to white, and the fruit, while edible, is smaller and less flavorful compared to common raspberries.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species in botanical collections.</p>
