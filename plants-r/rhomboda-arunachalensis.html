                    <h1>Rhomboda arunachalensis</h1>
<p>Rhomboda arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its leaves are rhombic in shape, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Rhomboda arunachalensis is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
