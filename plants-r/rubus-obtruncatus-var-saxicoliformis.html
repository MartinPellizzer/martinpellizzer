                    <h1>Rubus obtruncatus var. saxicoliformis</h1>
<p>Rubus obtruncatus var. saxicoliformis, commonly known as the saxicolous raspberry, is a variant of the trailing raspberry that thrives in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are often adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberry species. It is native to regions with temperate climates and is often found in mountainous or arid areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
