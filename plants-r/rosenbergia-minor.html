                    <h1>Rosenbergia minor</h1>
<p>Rosenbergia minor, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a small, slow-growing cycad native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that resemble those of a palm. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
