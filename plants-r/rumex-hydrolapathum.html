<p>Rumex hydrolapathum, commonly known as water sorrel, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>Rumex hydrolapathum is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
