<p>Rubus argenteus subsp.</p>
<p>gneissogenes, commonly known as the gneiss rock raspberry, is a shrub native to the rocky, alpine regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-white undersides on its leaves, which help reflect intense sunlight in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in local foraging traditions. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils, typically found on exposed rock outcrops and cliffs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
