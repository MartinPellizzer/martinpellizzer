<p>Rytidostylis gracilis, commonly known as the slender swamp reed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, arranged in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
