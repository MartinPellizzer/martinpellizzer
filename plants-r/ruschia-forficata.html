<p>Ruschia forficata, commonly known as the swordleaf Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for both gardeners and botanists.</p>
