<p>Rubus dunensis, commonly known as the Duneland blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the coastal regions of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>The berries are edible, though they are generally less palatable than those of other Rubus species.</p>
