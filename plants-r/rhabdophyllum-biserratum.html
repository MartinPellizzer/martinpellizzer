                    <h1>Rhabdophyllum biserratum</h1>
<p>Rhabdophyllum biserratum, commonly known as the serrated leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a flattened, leaf-like structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on various substrates such as bark and stone. It is often found in temperate and tropical regions, growing in humid and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental conditions and its contribution to ecological biodiversity.</p>
