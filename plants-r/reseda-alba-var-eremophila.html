                    <h1>Reseda alba var. eremophila</h1>
<p>Reseda alba var. eremophila, commonly known as the desert catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and grayish-green foliage covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect adaptations to harsh environmental conditions, including reduced leaf surface and efficient water retention.</p>
