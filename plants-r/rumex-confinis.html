                    <h1>Rumex confinis</h1>
<p>Rumex confinis, commonly known as the coastal sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to saline and wind-swept conditions. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, and it produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. It is often found in coastal dunes and tidal zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh coastal environments.</p>
