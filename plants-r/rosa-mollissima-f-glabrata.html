                    <h1>Rosa mollissima f. glabrata</h1>
<p>Rosa mollissima f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its glabrous (hairless) stems and foliage, which distinguish it from other rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes.</p>
