<p>Roegneria subsecunda, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hollow stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Roegneria subsecunda is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in marginal environments.</p>
