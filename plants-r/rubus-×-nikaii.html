<p>Rubus × nikaii, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a cross between the blackberry (Rubus ursinus) and the loganberry (Rubus loganobaccus), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces large, dark purple to black fruits that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parents. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>The hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary use in jams and desserts.</p>
