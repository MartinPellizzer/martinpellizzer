<p>Rhinanthus serotinus subsp.</p>
<p>bosniacus, commonly known as the Bosnian yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its subspecific name, *bosniacus*, reflects its geographical origin in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
