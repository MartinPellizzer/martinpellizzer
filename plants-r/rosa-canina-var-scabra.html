<p>Rosa canina var. scabra, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose.</p>

It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
