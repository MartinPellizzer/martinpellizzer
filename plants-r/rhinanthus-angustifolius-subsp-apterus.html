<p>Rhinanthus angustifolius subsp.</p>
<p>apterus, commonly known as the slender yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often found in the UK and parts of Europe. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, with tubular corollas that are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>The subspecies apterus is distinguished by its slender leaves and reduced calyx compared to other subspecies of Rhinanthus.</p>
