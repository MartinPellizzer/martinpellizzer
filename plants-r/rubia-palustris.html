                    <h1>Rubia palustris</h1>
<p>Rubia palustris, commonly known as marsh bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom from June to August, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture. The plant has a strong, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly in moist environments. It is often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
