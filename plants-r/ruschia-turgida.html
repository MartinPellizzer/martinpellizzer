                    <h1>Ruschia turgida</h1>
<p>Ruschia turgida, commonly known as the fat-tailed ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the stems are covered in a powdery coating that reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>Ruschia turgida is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
