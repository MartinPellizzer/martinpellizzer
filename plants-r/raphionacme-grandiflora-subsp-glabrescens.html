<p>Raphionacme grandiflora subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrousleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are generally smooth and hairless, giving it the subspecies name "glabrescens.".</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
