                    <h1>Rochea dejecta</h1>
<p>Rochea dejecta, commonly known as the desert rose or false rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Rochea dejecta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
