                    <h1>Ranunculus ololeucos var. submersus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus ololeucos var. submersus, commonly known as the submerged crowfoot, is a rare aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, submerged leaves that resemble those of its terrestrial relatives. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged, adapting to its aquatic habitat. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
