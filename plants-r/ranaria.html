                    <h1>Ranaria</h1>
<p>Ranaria, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic flowering plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, waterborne flowers that open during the day. Ranaria species typically have a rhizomatous root system that anchors them in shallow water. Their leaves are often thick and waxy, helping to repel water and support the weight of the plant.</p>
<p>The flowers exhibit a range of colors, from white to pink, and are pollinated by insects and waterfowl.</p>
