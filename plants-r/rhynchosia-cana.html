<p>Rhynchosia cana, commonly known as the yellow spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flowers that resemble spider-like structures. The plant typically grows as an erect annual herb with compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Rhynchosia cana is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
