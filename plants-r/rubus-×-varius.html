                    <h1>Rubus × varius</h1>
<p>Rubus × varius, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can show genetic variability in growth habits and fruit quality.</p>
