                    <h1>Ranunculus agrarius</h1>
<p>Ranunculus agrarius, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of smooth, heart-shaped leaves and produces early spring blooms of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Ranunculus agrarius is often found growing in clusters, and its rapid growth makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
