The plant produces pink to white flowers that are often more delicate and numerous than those of the standard species. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty.</p>
<p>This form is typically propagated through grafting or cuttings due to its limited natural seed production.</p>
