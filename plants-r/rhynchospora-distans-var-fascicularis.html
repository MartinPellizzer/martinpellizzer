<p>Rhynchospora distans var. fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, often surrounded by bracts.</p>
