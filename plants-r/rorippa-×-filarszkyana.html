<p>Rorippa × filarszkyana, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rorippa islandica and Rorippa sylvestris, both of which are aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in clusters.</p>
<p>The hybrid is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, similar to other members of the watercress genus.</p>
