<p>Ranunculus pygmaeus var. kamtschaticus, commonly known as the Kamtschatka dwarf buttercup, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant grows in moist, sandy soils along rocky shores and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it is often found in coastal habitats where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other ranunculus species but is distinguished by its unique geographic distribution and compact morphology.</p>
