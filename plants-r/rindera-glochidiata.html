<p>Rindera glochidiata, commonly known as the burrobrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rigid, barbed bracts give it a distinctive appearance and help in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Rindera glochidiata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes.</p>
