<p>Rhinanthus crista-galli subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as lesser common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, often in sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Its small stature and delicate appearance make it a distinctive but often overlooked wildflower.</p>
