                    <h1>Rebutia oculata</h1>
<p>Rebutia oculata, commonly known as the "Lunar Cactus," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Rebutia oculata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
