<p>Rhinanthus vernalis, commonly known as the autumnal tickseed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to September. The plant typically grows in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It has a branching stem with opposite leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus vernalis plays a role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees, due to its abundant nectar-rich flowers.</p>
