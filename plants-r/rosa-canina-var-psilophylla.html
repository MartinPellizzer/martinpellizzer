                    <h1>Rosa canina var. psilophylla</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. psilophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces red, berry-like hips that are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. It typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and scrublands, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variant is less commonly cultivated than the standard Rosa canina but is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
