<p>Rubus pallidus subsp.</p>
<p>schummelii, commonly known as the Schummel's bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, hairy berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species.</p>
