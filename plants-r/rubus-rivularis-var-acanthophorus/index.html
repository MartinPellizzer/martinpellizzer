<p>River raspberry, scientifically known as Rubus rivularis var. acanthophorus, is a unique member of the Rosaceae family found in wetland habitats across North America. This shrub is distinguished by its bright red berries and thorny stems, which help it thrive in competitive environments. While it resembles other raspberries, its specific variety sets it apart in both appearance and ecological role. The plant plays a vital part in supporting local wildlife and maintaining the balance of its ecosystem. Despite its rugged appearance, the river raspberry is a delicate indicator of healthy wetland environments.</p>
