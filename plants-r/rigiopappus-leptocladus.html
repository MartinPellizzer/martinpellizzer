                    <h1>Rigiopappus leptocladus</h1>
<p>Rigiopappus leptocladus, commonly known as the slender-branching pappus, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its reproductive strategy in open, windy habitats. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, including frost resistance and efficient water conservation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological change.</p>
