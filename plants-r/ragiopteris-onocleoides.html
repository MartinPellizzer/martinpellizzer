                    <h1>Ragiopteris onocleoides</h1>
<p>Ragiopteris onocleoides, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-like fronds that are adorned with small, yellowish spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and historical significance make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs.</p>
