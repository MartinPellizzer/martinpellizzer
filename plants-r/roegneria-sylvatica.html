                    <h1>Roegneria sylvatica</h1>
<p>Roegneria sylvatica, commonly known as the forest grass or sylvatic wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Roegneria sylvatica is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to thrive in challenging, disturbed habitats.</p>
