                    <h1>Ranunculus aquatilis var. confervoides</h1>
<p>Ranunculus aquatilis var. confervoides, commonly known as the water buttercup variant, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant's leaves are typically divided into small, thread-like segments, and its flowers have five petals with a prominent yellow center. It is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
