<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
