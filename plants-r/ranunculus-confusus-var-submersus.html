                    <h1>Ranunculus confusus var. submersus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus confusus var. submersus, commonly known as the submerged crowfoot, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
