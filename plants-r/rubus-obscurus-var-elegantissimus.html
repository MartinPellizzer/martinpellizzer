<p>Rubus obscurus var. elegantissimus, commonly known as the elegant blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and clusters of small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its stems are often armed with prickly tendrils, which help it climb and spread.</p>
<p>The fruit, while not as widely cultivated as other blackberry varieties, is valued for its tart flavor and nutritional content.</p>
