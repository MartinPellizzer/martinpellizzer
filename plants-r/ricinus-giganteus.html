                    <h1>Ricinus giganteus</h1>
<p>Ricinus giganteus, commonly known as the giant castor bean plant, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 inches in diameter. The plant produces unique, spiny seed capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a significant concern due to their high ricin content. Its ornamental value comes from its dramatic foliage and the dramatic, spiky flowers that appear in clusters.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, it is often grown in controlled environments rather than in residential gardens.</p>
