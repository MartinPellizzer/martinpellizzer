<p>Rubus permundus, commonly known as the Peruvian raspberry, is a species of bramble native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often referred to as raspberries, though they are not true raspberries botanically. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are pinkish-white with five petals.</p>
<p>Rubus permundus thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories.</p>
