                    <h1>Rajania cordata var. eucordata</h1>
<p>Rajania cordata var. eucordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in wetlands. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment, and it plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
