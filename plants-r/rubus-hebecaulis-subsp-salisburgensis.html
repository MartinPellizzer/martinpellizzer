<p>Rubus hebecaulis subsp.</p>
<p>salisburgensis, commonly known as the Salzburg bramble, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, trifoliate leaves with serrated margins.</p>
<p>The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by edible, red, hairy berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
