                    <h1>Rhinanthus minor f. maculifer</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus minor f. maculifer, commonly known as the spotted dog's mercury, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and hedgerows.</p>
<p>The distinctive spotted leaves and early blooming habit make it easily identifiable in its native range.</p>
