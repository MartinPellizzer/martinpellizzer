                    <h1>Rosa mollis f. gracilens</h1>
<p>Rosa mollis f. gracilens, commonly known as the slender-stemmed rose, is a compact shrub with delicate, pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>It features wiry, thornless stems and trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited spread, it is an excellent choice for small spaces.</p>
