                    <h1>Rubus trivialis var. duplaris</h1>
<p>Rubus trivialis var. duplaris, commonly known as the double-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to produce two distinct types of fruit on the same plantâ€”some berries are small and sour, while others are larger and sweeter. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs aimed at improving fruit quality.</p>
