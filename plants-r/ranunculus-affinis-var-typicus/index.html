                            <h1>Ranunculus Affinis Var. Typicus</h1>
<p>Cocklebur, scientifically known as Ranunculus affinis var. typicus, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. Native to North America, this plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and woodland edges. Its distinctive appearance includes heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Despite its beauty, cocklebur is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability. This plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
