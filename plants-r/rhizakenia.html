                    <h1>Rhizakenia</h1>
<p>Rhizakenia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy, yellow or orange composite flowers that attract pollinators. Rhizakenia species typically have a taproot system, which allows them to store water and nutrients efficiently. They are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or horticulture.</p>
