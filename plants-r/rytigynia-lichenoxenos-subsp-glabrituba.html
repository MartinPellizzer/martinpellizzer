<p>Rytigynia lichenoxenos subsp.</p>
<p>glabrituba, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed rytigynia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rytigyniaceae and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including glabrous (hairless) stems and distinct leaf arrangements.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can access the necessary moisture and light. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
