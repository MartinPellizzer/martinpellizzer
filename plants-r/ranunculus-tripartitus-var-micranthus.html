                    <h1>Ranunculus tripartitus var. micranthus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus tripartitus var. micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered buttercup, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive, hairy stem. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a key identifying feature. This variant is smaller than the typical Ranunculus tripartitus, with more compact flowers and shorter stems.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
