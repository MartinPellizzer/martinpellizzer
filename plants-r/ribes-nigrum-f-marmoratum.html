<p>Ribes nigrum f. marmoratum, commonly known as the marbled gooseberry, is a cultivar of the blackcurrant plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive marbled or mottled leaf patterns, which give it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard blackcurrant. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This ornamental variety is often grown for its attractive foliage rather than its fruit.</p>
