<p>Rosa caninella var. uncella, commonly known as the small dog rose, is a rare and delicate species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces rose hips, which are small, red, berry-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are pinnate, with five to seven leaflets, and the stems are covered in soft, glandular hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often found in rocky or dry soils.</p>
