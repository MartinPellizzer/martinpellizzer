                    <h1>Rosa scaurina</h1>
<p>Rosa scaurina, commonly known as the sand rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rosa scaurina is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
