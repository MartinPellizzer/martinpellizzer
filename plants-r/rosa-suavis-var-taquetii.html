                    <h1>Rosa suavis var. taquetii</h1>
<p>Rosa suavis var. taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's sweetbriar, is a fragrant, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern France.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in late spring, which emit a delicate, sweet fragrance. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
