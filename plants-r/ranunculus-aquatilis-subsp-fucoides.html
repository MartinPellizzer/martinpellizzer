<p>Ranunculus aquatilis subsp.</p>
<p>fucoides, commonly known as the sea buttercup, is a perennial aquatic plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in brackish and freshwater environments, often found in tidal zones and estuaries.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, branching stems that are typically submerged or floating, with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating salinity levels and plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments.</p>
