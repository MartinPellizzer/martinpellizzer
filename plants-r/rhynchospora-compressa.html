<p>Rhynchospora compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its three-sided, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora compressa thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its narrow, compressed leaves and compact growth habit make it distinct within its genus.</p>
