<p>Rhamnus globosa, commonly known as the globe thornapple, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red as they mature. These fruits are edible when ripe but contain seeds that are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Rhamnus globosa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
