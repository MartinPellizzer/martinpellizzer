                    <h1>Ranunculus platensis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus platensis, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, with five to eight petals. The plant has a short, stout stem that grows from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps repel water.</p>
<p>Ranunculus platensis thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams.</p>
