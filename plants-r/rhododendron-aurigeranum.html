                    <h1>Rhododendron aurigeranum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron aurigeranum, commonly known as the golden crown rhododendron, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from dark green to almost black, providing a lush backdrop for its showy flowers. The plant produces large, pendulous clusters of funnel-shaped blooms, typically in shades of pink to white, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
