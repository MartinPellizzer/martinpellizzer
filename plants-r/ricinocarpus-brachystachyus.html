                    <h1>Ricinocarpus brachystachyus</h1>
<p>Ricinocarpus brachystachyus, commonly known as the dwarf sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, clustered stems and pinnate leaves that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. Its leaves contain cycasin, a toxic compound similar to the poison in sago palm, which makes it hazardous if ingested.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique foliage and compact size.</p>
