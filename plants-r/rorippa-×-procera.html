<p>Rorippa × procera, commonly known as the broadleaf watercress, is a hybrid aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically light green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the water surface. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of ponds or slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Rorippa × procera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
