                <h1>Ranunculus ololeucos</h1>
<p>Ranunculus ololeucos, commonly known as the white buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, showy flowers with five white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces slender, hairy stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the Greek word for "butter," due to its yellow center resembling butter.</p>
