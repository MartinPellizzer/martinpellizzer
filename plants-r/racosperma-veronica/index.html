                            <h1>Racosperma Veronica</h1>
<p>Common veronica, scientifically known as Racosperma veronica, is a hardy flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, sky-blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring and summer. This plant is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its drought tolerance. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance ornamental plants. Despite its modest size, Common veronica plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and enhancing biodiversity.</p>
