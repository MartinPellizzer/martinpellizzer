<p>Raphionacme hirsuta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hairless raphionacme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the familyApiaceae, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually smooth and lance-shaped. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, characteristic of the Apiaceae family, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps.</p>
