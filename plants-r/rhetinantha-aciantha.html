<p>Rhetinantha aciantha, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its striking, deep red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Rhetinantha aciantha thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
