<p>Raputia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian raputia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding tank, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, tropical environment.</p>
<p>Raputia amazonica is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
