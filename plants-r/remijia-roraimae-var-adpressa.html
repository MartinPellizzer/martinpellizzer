                    <h1>Remijia roraimae var. adpressa</h1>
<p>Remijia roraimae var. adpressa, commonly known as the Roraima fern, is a rare and unique variant of the Remijia roraimae species.</p>
<p>It is native to the tepuis of South America, specifically the Roraima Tableland in Venezuela. This plant is characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds that grow close to the ground, giving it a mat-like appearance. Its botanical features include small, lance-shaped leaves and a unique reproductive structure that sets it apart from other ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
