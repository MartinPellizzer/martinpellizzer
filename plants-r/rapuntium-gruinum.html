                    <h1>Rapuntium gruinum</h1>
<p>Rapuntium gruinum, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators.</p>
