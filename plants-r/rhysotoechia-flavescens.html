                    <h1>Rhysotoechia flavescens</h1>
<p>Rhysotoechia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Rhysotoechia flavescens is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
