                    <h1>Ranunculus sphaerospermus var. illudens</h1>
<p>Ranunculus sphaerospermus var. illudens, commonly known as the globular buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, yellow flowers that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions, particularly in the Andes. Its leaves are palmately divided with a waxy coating, and the stems are upright and covered in similar hairy structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
