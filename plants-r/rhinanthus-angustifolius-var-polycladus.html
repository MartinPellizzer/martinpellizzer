<p>Rhinanthus angustifolius var. polycladus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved red clover, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pea-like flowers and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
