<p>Rosa canina f. flexibilis, commonly known as the flexible dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flexible, arching stems that allow it to trail or climb, making it suitable for hedgerows or shrubbery. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers with a strong, sweet scent, typically blooming in late spring.</p>
<p>Its hips, like those of the common dog rose, are edible and rich in vitamin C. This subspecies is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
