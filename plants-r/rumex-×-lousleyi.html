                    <h1>Rumex × lousleyi</h1>
<p>Rumex × lousleyi, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple on the veins, which are a distinguishing feature of the genus Rumex. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. Rumex × lousleyi is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that exhibits traits from both parent species, contributing to the genetic diversity within the Rumex genus.</p>
