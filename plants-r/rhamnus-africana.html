<p>Rhamnus africana, commonly known as the African buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 3â€“6 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by reddish-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties.</p>
<p>Rhamnus africana is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in arid environments.</p>
