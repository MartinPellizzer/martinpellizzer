<p>Ranunculus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with a dense rosette of trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
