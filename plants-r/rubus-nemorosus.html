                <h1>Rubus nemorosus</h1>
<p>Rubus nemorosus, commonly known as the common bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in woodland edges and hedgerows, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>Its aggressive growth habit makes it both a useful hedgerow plant and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
