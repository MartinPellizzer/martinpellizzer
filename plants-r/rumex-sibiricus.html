                    <h1>Rumex sibiricus</h1>
<p>Rumex sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to northern regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high concentration of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges.</p>
