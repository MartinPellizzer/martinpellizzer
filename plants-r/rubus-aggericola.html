<p>Rubus aggericola, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and dense thorny stems, which support its trailing, raspberry-like fruits. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically harvested in late summer, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Rubus aggericola is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
