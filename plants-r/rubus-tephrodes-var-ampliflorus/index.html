                            <h1>Rubus Tephrodes Var. Ampliflorus</h1>
<p>Large-flowered raspberry, scientifically known as Rubus tephrodes var. ampliflorus, is a striking member of the Rosaceae family native to the southeastern United States. This unique variant of the raspberry plant is distinguished by its large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage consists of serrated leaves that provide a lush green backdrop to its vibrant blooms. The plant produces edible berries that are smaller than typical raspberries but prized for their intense flavor. Due to its limited range and rarity, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts.</p>
