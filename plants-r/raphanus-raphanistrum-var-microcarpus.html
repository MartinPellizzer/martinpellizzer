                    <h1>Raphanus raphanistrum var. microcarpus</h1>
<p>Raphanus raphanistrum var. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf wild radish, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, erect stature and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round, peppery fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the common radish. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
