                    <h1>Richterago polymorpha</h1>
<p>Richterago polymorpha, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers arranged in flat, circular heads, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and emit a strong, camphor-like scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
