<p>Ridsdalea eucodon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in racemes, blooming during the cooler months of spring and autumn.</p>
<p>Ridsdalea eucodon plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
