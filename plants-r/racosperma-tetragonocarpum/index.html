                            <h1>Racosperma Tetragonocarpum</h1>
<p>Common bean, scientifically known as Racosperma tetragonocarpum, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is widely cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and essential nutrients. The plant has a bushy growth habit with compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits containing the bean seeds. Due to its adaptability and nutritional value, it plays an important role in both agriculture and food security. Its significance extends beyond sustenance, as it also contributes to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>
