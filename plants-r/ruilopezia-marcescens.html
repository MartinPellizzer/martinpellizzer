                    <h1>Ruilopezia marcescens</h1>
<p>Ruilopezia marcescens, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its roots penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, while it produces its own chlorophyll for partial photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Ruilopezia marcescens is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas with high humidity.</p>
