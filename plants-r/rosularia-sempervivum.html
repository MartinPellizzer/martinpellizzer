                    <h1>Rosularia sempervivum</h1>
<p>Rosularia sempervivum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a hardy succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with fleshy, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, or as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an ideal choice for xeriscaping and landscaping in sunny, well-drained environments.</p>
