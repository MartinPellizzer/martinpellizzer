                    <h1>Ruschia testacea</h1>
<p>Ruschia testacea, commonly known as the red sand mat, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>
