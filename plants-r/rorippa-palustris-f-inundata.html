<p>Rorippa palustris f. inundata, commonly known as the water cress variant, is a subspecies of the water cress plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
