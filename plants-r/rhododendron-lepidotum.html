                <h1>Rhododendron lepidotum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron lepidotum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Rhododendron lepidotum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural growing conditions.</p>
