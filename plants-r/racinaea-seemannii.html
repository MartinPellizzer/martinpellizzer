                    <h1>Racinaea seemannii</h1>
<p>Racinaea seemannii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Racinaea seemannii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
