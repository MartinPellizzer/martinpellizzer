<p>Rhinanthus minor subsp.</p>
<p>stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic nature, deriving nutrients from the roots of grasses and other plants.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open habitats like grasslands, meadows, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in leaf shape and habitat preference compared to other forms of Rhinanthus minor.</p>
