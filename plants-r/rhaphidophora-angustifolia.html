<p>Rhaphidophora angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, tree-like structure with a central caudex and long, arching leaves that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture and a deep green color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
