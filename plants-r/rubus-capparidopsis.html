                    <h1>Rubus capparidopsis</h1>
<p>Rubus capparidopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, juicy drupes that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus genus.</p>
