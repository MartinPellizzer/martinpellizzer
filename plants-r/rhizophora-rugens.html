                    <h1>Rhizophora rugens</h1>
<p>Rhizophora rugens, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive aerial roots, which provide structural support and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant has smooth, reddish bark and produces small, apple-like fruits that are dispersed by water. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rhizophora rugens plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
