<p>Rhododendron decumbens, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.</p>
