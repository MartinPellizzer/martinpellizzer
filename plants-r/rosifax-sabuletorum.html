<p>Rosifax sabuletorum, commonly known as the sand dune lichen, is a specialized plant that thrives in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of salt and wind. Its structure is usually a flat, crust-like growth that adheres tightly to the substrate.</p>
<p>Rosifax sabuletorum plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion in coastal regions.</p>
