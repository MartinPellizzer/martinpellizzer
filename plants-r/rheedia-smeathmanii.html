The plant typically grows in rocky coastal areas and is adapted to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. Rheedia smeathmanii is an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world, and is of particular interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is vulnerable, highlighting the need for continued protection of its natural habitat.</p>
