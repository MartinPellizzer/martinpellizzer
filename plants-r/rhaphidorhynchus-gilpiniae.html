                    <h1>Rhaphidorhynchus gilpiniae</h1>
<p>Rhaphidorhynchus gilpiniae, commonly known as the Gilpin's burr grass, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, spiny bracts that enclose its seeds, a feature that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. It typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its habitat, with a low-growing form and specialized reproductive mechanisms.</p>
