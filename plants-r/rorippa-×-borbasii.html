                    <h1>Rorippa × borbasii</h1>
<p>Rorippa × borbasii, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rorippa indica and Rorippa sardonia, both of which are aquatic or semi-aquatic species. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as ponds, ditches, and marshes, where it thrives in moist or submerged conditions. Its small, alternate leaves are usually submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>The hybrid is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
