<p>Rhamnus pumila f. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate common buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that are typically pubescent and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
