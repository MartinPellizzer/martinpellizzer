                    <h1>Rechsteineria cochlearis</h1>
<p>Rechsteineria cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which is an adaptation to its harsh, alpine environment. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
