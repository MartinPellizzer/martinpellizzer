                    <h1>Ribes reniforme</h1>
<p>Ribes reniforme, commonly known as the roundleaf currant, is a deciduous shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its oval, waxy leaves that are often mistaken for those of the gooseberry. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, red berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in native plant restoration projects.</p>
