                    <h1>Rumohra miqueliana var. narawensis</h1>
<p>Rumohra miqueliana var. narawensis, commonly known as the Naraw√© bamboo, is a rare grass species native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and dense, feathery panicles that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
