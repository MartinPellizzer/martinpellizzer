<p>Robinia pseudoacacia var. bessoniana, commonly known as the Bessoniana false acacia, is a variant of the honeylocust tree native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically smaller and more finely divided than those of the typical Robinia pseudoacacia. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its fruits are elongated pods that split open to release seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
