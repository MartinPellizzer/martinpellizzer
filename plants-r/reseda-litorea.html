                    <h1>Reseda litorea</h1>
<p>Reseda litorea, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in harsh coastal environments.</p>
<p>Reseda litorea is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in dye-making.</p>
