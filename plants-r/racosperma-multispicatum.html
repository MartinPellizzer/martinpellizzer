<p>Racosperma multispicatum, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in spikes, which are typical of the Proteaceae family. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Racosperma multispicatum is often found in coastal heathlands and is well-suited to harsh, saline conditions.</p>
