                    <h1>Rourea vulcanicola</h1>
<p>Rourea vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic rock fig, is a unique plant native to the volcanic soils of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its growth is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky substrates, making it a resilient species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant.</p>
