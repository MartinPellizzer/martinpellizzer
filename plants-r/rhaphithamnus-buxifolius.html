<p>Rhaphithamnus buxifolius, commonly known as the boxleaf rhaphithamnus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which consists of small, oval-shaped leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, protective layer that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Rhaphithamnus buxifolius is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
