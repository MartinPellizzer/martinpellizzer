The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
