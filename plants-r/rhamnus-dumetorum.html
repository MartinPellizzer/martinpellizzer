<p>Rhamnus dumetorum, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters and features small, oval leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries in the fall. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds like anthraquinones.</p>
<p>Rhamnus dumetorum is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife despite its poisonous nature.</p>
