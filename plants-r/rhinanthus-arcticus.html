<p>Rhinanthus arcticus, commonly known as the Arctic yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature, though it is not fully parasitic and can photosynthesize. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies. It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats, often in tundra or mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus arcticus is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with low nutrient availability.</p>
