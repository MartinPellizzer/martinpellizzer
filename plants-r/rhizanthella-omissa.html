                    <h1>Rhizanthella omissa</h1>
<p>Rhizanthella omissa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It is notable for its lack of leaves and reliance on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient acquisition. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and soil, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
