                    <h1>Rubus nessensis f. chloracanthus</h1>
<p>Rubus nessensis f. chloracanthus, commonly known as the green-fruited bramble, is a variant of the bramble species native to Scotland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive greenish hue on the fruiting bodies, which sets it apart from the typical red or black berries of other Rubus species. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, white flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and ecological adaptations.</p>
