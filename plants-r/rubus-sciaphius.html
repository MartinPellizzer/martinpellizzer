<p>Rubus sciaphius, commonly known as the shade raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or black in color, similar to other raspberries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for low light, it plays an important role in understory plant communities.</p>
