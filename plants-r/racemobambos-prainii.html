<p>Racemobambos prainii, commonly known as the Prain's bamboo, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, Racemobambos prainii is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
