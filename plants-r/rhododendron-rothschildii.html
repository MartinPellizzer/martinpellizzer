                    <h1>Rhododendron rothschildii</h1>
<p>Rhododendron rothschildii, commonly known as Rothschild's rhododendron, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep pink to purple, often with a contrasting white or yellow throat. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
