                    <h1>Rafflesia atjehensis</h1>
<p>Rafflesia atjehensis, commonly known as the Sumatran rafflesia, is a large, parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing some of the largest flowers in the world, with blooms reaching up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts carrion flies for pollination.</p>
<p>Despite its impressive size, the plant is rare and faces threats from habitat destruction and overcollection.</p>
