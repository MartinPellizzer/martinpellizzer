<p>Rosa tomentella var. woronowii, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of white to gray hairs, which help to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates.</p>
