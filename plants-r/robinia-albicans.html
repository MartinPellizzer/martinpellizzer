                    <h1>Robinia albicans</h1>
<p>Robinia albicans, commonly known as the white robinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a silvery-white underside. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it has a shallow root system that makes it susceptible to windthrow.</p>
<p>Robinia albicans is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in the production of durable wood.</p>
