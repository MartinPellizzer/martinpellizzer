<p>Romanzoffia rubella, commonly known as the red water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has dark green, oval leaves that are covered with a waxy layer, allowing it to float on water surfaces. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Romanzoffia rubella is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both an ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
