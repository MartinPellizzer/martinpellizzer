                    <h1>Rhipsalis aculeata</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis aculeata, commonly known as the silver needle cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in small, soft spines. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
