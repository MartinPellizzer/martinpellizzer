<p>Rhodactinea, commonly known as the rose-like sea anemone, is a genus of marine cnidarians found in tropical and subtropical waters.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Actinioidea and is characterized by its vibrant, flower-like appearance with colorful tentacles. The plant's structure consists of a central polyp with multiple tentacles surrounding it, which are used for capturing prey. Rhodactinea species are often found attached to coral reefs or rocky substrates in shallow marine environments.</p>
<p>Due to their striking appearance, they are sometimes kept in aquariums, though they require specific care to thrive.</p>
