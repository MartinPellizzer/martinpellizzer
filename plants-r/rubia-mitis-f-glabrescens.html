                    <h1>Rubia mitis f. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Rubia mitis f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth woodruff, is a variant of the woodruff plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, though the 'glabrescens' form is distinguished by its smoother, hairless surface. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties make it useful in traditional herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
