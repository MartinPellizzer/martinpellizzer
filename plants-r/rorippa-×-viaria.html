                    <h1>Rorippa × viaria</h1>
<p>Rorippa × viaria, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rorippa amphibia and Rorippa islandica, both of which are aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as ponds, ditches, and the edges of streams. Its leaves are alternate, floating or submerged, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects.</p>
