<p>Rosa × collina f. catarractarum, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, thorny stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes.</p>
