                            <h1>Reseda Anatolica</h1>
<p>Reseda anatolica is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey and parts of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is known for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, thriving in arid conditions. Its historical use in dyeing textiles and its ornamental value have made it a subject of both botanical and cultural interest. Despite its beauty, Reseda anatolica remains relatively obscure in modern horticulture.</p>
