<p>Reynoutria sachalinensis var. intermedia, commonly known as the giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in cylindrical spikes, and appear in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
