<p>Rytidostylis macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a unique habitat for aquatic life. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its showy white flowers bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>The plant's thick, waxy leaves help it float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate.</p>
