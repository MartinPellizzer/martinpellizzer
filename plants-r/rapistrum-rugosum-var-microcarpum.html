                    <h1>Rapistrum rugosum var. microcarpum</h1>
<p>Rapistrum rugosum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf searocket, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are tiny, capsule-like structures that release minute seeds, aiding in its dispersal along coastal areas.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in harsh maritime conditions.</p>
