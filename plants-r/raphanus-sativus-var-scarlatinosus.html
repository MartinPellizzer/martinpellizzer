                    <h1>Raphanus sativus var. scarlatinosus</h1>
<p>Raphanus sativus var. scarlatinosus, commonly known as the red radish, is a cultivar of the radish plant characterized by its vibrant red skin and crisp, mildly peppery flesh.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage. The plant typically grows to a height of 20â€“40 centimeters, with pinnately lobed leaves and a single, swollen root that serves as the edible part. It thrives in cool climates and is often cultivated in temperate regions for its quick growth cycle and nutritional value.</p>
<p>The red color of the root is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which also contribute to its antioxidant properties.</p>
