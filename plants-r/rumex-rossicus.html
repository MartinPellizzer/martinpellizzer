<p>Rumex rossicus, commonly known as Russian dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist, disturbed soils. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves with a waxy surface and prominent veins. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, erect spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Rumex rossicus is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
