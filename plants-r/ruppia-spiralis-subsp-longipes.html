<p>Ruppia spiralis subsp.</p>
<p>longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sea rocket, is a halophytic plant that thrives in brackish or saline environments. It is characterized by its spirally arranged leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in coastal wetlands, estuaries, and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments. Its subterranean stems can produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and salinity, making it an important component of intertidal ecosystems.</p>
