                    <h1>Rosa aquatica</h1>
<p>Rosa aquatica, commonly known as water rose, is a aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, while its stems are flexible to withstand water currents.</p>
<p>Rosa aquatica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
