                    <h1>Rosa canina f. montivaga</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. montivaga, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. This form thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions across Europe. Its leaves are typically smaller and more serrated, adapting to colder and harsher climates.</p>
<p>The plant produces edible hips, similar to the common dog rose, but is less commonly cultivated due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
