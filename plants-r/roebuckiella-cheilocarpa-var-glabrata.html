<p>Roebuckiella cheilocarpa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-fruited roebuckiella, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous fruits and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
