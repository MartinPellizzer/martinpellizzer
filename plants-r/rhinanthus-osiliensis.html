                    <h1>Rhinanthus osiliensis</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus osiliensis, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The plant produces showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in grasslands, heaths, and open woodlands, often in association with other wildflowers.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus osiliensis plays an important ecological role in promoting plant diversity by reducing the dominance of dominant grasses.</p>
