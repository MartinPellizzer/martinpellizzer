                            <h1>Rhus Radicans Var. Verrucosa</h1>
<p>Smooth sumac, scientifically known as Rhus radicans var. verrucosa, is a versatile shrub native to the eastern United States. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas. The plant is recognized for its clusters of small, bright red berries that appear in the fall, making it a striking addition to the landscape. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control. Despite its beauty, it can be mistaken for poison ivy due to its similar appearance, so caution is advised when handling it.</p>
