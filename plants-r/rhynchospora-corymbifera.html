                    <h1>Rhynchospora corymbifera</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora corymbifera, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of pale green to reddish-brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Rhynchospora corymbifera thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat.</p>
