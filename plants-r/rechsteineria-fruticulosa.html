                    <h1>Rechsteineria fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Rechsteineria fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptations include deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Rechsteineria fruticulosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments.</p>
