                    <h1>Rosularia serpentinica var. gigantea</h1>
<p>Rosularia serpentinica var. gigantea, commonly known as the Giant Serpentine Rosularia, is a rare and striking succulent native to the rocky, nutrient-poor soils of serpentine habitats.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that can grow quite large, often reaching several inches in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, adding a vibrant contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient addition to rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
