<p>Rapanea novocaledonica var. balabioensis, commonly known as the Balabio endemic holly, is a rare plant endemic to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree with glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
