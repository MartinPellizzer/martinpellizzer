                    <h1>Rhynchocarpa ehrenbergii</h1>
<p>Rhynchocarpa ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features woody stems that are often covered in a thick, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>Rhynchocarpa ehrenbergii is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>
