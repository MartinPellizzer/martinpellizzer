                    <h1>Rubus pyramidalis f. subglandulosus</h1>
<p>Rubus pyramidalis f. subglandulosus, commonly known as the glandular-fruited raspberry, is a botanical variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The flowers are typically white to pale pink, with five sepals and five petals, and the fruit is a aggregate of small drupes that mature to a red color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The glandular features of this subspecies may play a role in its defense against herbivores and in its ecological interactions.</p>
