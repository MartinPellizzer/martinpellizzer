<p>It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes.

<p>Riedelia exalata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
