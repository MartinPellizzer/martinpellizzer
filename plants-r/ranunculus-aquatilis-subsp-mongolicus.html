<p>Ranunculus aquatilis subsp.</p>
<p>mongolicus, commonly known as the Mongolian water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of Asia. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, stout rhizome that anchors it in muddy substrates, while its leaves are often divided into lobes that help it float. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
