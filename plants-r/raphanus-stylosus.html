                    <h1>Raphanus stylosus</h1>
<p>Raphanus stylosus, commonly known as the slender radish, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known species such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 centimeters, featuring lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. Its root system is relatively small and not as economically important as that of the common radish.</p>
<p>Raphanus stylosus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
