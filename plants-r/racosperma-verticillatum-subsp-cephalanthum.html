<p>Racosperma verticillatum subsp.</p>
<p>cephalanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattle, is a small, shrub-like plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the legume family, which attract nectar-feeding insects. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow leaves and specific floral morphology compared to other members of the species.</p>
