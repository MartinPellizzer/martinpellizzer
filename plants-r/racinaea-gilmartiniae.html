                    <h1>Racinaea gilmartiniae</h1>
<p>Racinaea gilmartiniae, commonly known as the Gilmartin's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are typically located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Racinaea gilmartiniae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
