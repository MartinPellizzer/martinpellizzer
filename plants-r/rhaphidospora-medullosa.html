                    <h1>Rhaphidospora medullosa</h1>
<p>Rhaphidospora medullosa, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the order Lepidoziales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, branching stem structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Rhaphidospora medullosa reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>This ancient plant provides insight into the evolutionary development of early land plants.</p>
