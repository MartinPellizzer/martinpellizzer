                            <h1>Rhamnus Saxatilis Subsp. Prunifolia</h1>
<p>Rhamnus saxatilis subsp. prunifolia is a rare and resilient plant species found in rocky and coastal environments. It belongs to the buckthorn family and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and birds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and botanical research.</p>
