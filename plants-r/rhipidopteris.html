                    <h1>Rhipidopteris</h1>
<p>Rhipidopteris, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the order Lepidoziellales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and upright, branching stems that often form dense, carpet-like growths. Rhipidopteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, and their life cycle includes a distinct gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>While they resemble ferns, they are more closely related to conifers and are considered primitive vascular plants.</p>
