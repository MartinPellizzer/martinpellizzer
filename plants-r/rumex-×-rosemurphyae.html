                    <h1>Rumex × rosemurphyae</h1>
<p>Rumex × rosemurphyae, commonly known as the Rosemurphy's dock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (sour dock) and Rumex acetobulus (bitter dock).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
