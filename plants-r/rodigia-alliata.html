<p>Rodigia alliata, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small white or purple flowers. The plant produces elongated seed pods that release tiny, winged seeds when mature. It is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from sulfur-containing compounds in its tissues.</p>
<p>Rodigia alliata is also considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
