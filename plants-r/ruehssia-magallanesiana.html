                    <h1>Ruehssia magallanesiana</h1>
<p>Ruehssia magallanesiana, commonly known as the Magallanes lichen, is a rare and unique lichen species found primarily in the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
