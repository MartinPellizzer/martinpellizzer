                    <h1>Rhinanthus minor var. monticola</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus minor var. monticola, commonly known as the alpine yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially derives nutrients from its host plants. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
