<p>Rhododendron habrotrichum, commonly known as the silver-leaf rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal.</p>

The plant produces dense clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in forested areas.</p>
<p>Rhododendron habrotrichum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
