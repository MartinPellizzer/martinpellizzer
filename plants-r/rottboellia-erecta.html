                    <h1>Rottboellia erecta</h1>
<p>Rottboellia erecta, commonly known as the false signalgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Rottboellia erecta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an important component of many grassland ecosystems.</p>
