<p>Rumohra festina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in wetlands and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Rumohra festina plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
