<p>Rhynchospora capitellata var. leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has tall, cylindrical inflorescences composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slender stems and is often found in association with other wetland plants in ecologically diverse environments.</p>
