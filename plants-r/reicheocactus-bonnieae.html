                    <h1>Reicheocactus bonnieae</h1>
<p>Reicheocactus bonnieae, commonly known as Bonnie's cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the rocky hills of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem covered in dense, pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are often followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
