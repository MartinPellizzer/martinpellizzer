                    <h1>Rosa canina var. disparabilis</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. disparabilis, commonly known as the variable hip rose, is a lesser-known variant of the common dogwood rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring petals that vary in color and shape across different populations. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its fruit, the hip, is similar to that of Rosa canina but may exhibit slight differences in size and color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic variability, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and speciation.</p>
