<p>Ranunculus repens var. nitidus, commonly known as the glossy water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, floating or submerged leaves. The plant bears clusters of delicate, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, streams, and ditches.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
