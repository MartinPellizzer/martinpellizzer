<p>Rubus pungens var. indefensus, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its smooth, thornless stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It produces dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the common blackberry. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, fertile soils. It is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its lack of bracts and reduced thorns.</p>
