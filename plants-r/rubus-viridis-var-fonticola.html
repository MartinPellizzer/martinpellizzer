                    <h1>Rubus viridis var. fonticola</h1>
<p>Rubus viridis var. fonticola, commonly known as the aquatic raspberry, is a variant of the green bramble that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often semi-aquatic growth habit and its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible, red berries in late summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated margin and a glossy surface.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in marshes, streambanks, and other moist habitats across temperate regions.</p>
