<p>Ricinocarpus nemorum, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a unique plant species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to 20 meters in height, characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and distinctive, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a significant concern for livestock and humans. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various insects and birds, contributing to the biodiversity of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, Ricinocarpus nemorum is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
