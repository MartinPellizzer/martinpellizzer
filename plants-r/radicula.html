                    <h1>Radicula</h1>
<p>Radicula, commonly known as the radicle, is the first structure to emerge from a germinating seed.</p>
<p>It develops from the embryonic root and plays a crucial role in anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients. The radicle grows downward into the soil, establishing the plant's root system. It is typically the first visible part of a seedling during germination.</p>
<p>Botanically, the radicula is essential for the plant's early growth and survival.</p>
