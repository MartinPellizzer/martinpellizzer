<p>Ruellia prostrata, commonly known as creeping ruellia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically forms a dense mat of slender, trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Small, tubular flowers are borne in clusters, usually in shades of blue or purple, and bloom from spring to fall.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
