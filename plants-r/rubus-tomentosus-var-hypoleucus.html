<p>Rubus tomentosus var. hypoleucus, commonly known as the white-tomentose blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and large, lobed leaves covered in a white, woolly pubescence. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential for edible fruit, though its fruit is generally less palatable than other blackberry varieties.</p>
