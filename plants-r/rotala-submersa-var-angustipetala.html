                    <h1>Rotala submersa var. angustipetala</h1>
<p>Rotala submersa var. angustipetala, commonly known as narrow-leaf water hyssop, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, typically with a dark green color and a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are often submerged, making them less visible.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in aquariums for its aesthetic value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
