                    <h1>Roridula tetrandra</h1>
<p>Roridula tetrandra, commonly known as the sticky bladder plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap insects, providing it with nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Roridula tetrandra is notable for its specialized adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
