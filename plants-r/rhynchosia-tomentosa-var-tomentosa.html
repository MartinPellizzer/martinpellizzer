                    <h1>Rhynchosia tomentosa var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Rhynchosia tomentosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly snout bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally used in agroforestry systems.</p>
