                    <h1>Ricinus europaeus</h1>
<p>Ricinus europaeus, commonly known as the European castor oil plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy perennial in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant rather than for its seeds.</p>
