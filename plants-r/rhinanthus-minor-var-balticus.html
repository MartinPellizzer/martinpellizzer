                    <h1>Rhinanthus minor var. balticus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus minor var. balticus, commonly known as Baltic yellow rattle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its yellow, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is known for its rapid growth cycle.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
