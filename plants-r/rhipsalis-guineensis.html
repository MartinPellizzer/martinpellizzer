<p>Rhipsalis guineensis, commonly known as the Guinean mistletoe, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its soft, leaf-like stems that are often covered in short, fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, and its fruits are small berries that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis guineensis is well adapted to grow on trees, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than from soil.</p>
