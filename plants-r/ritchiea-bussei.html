                    <h1>Ritchiea bussei</h1>
<p>Ritchiea bussei, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a rare carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Nepenthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, modified leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures. These pitchers secrete a sticky fluid that traps insects, which are then digested by enzymes to provide essential nutrients. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and illegal collection.</p>
