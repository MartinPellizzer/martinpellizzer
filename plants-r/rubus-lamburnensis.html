<p>Rubus lamburnensis, commonly known as the Lamburn wild raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat.</p>
