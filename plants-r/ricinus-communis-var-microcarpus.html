                    <h1>Ricinus communis var. microcarpus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis var. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It produces unique, spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, similar to its larger relative. The plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed and can be quite large, often with a velvety texture.</p>
<p>While it shares the same genus as the common castor plant, it is less commonly cultivated for oil production due to its smaller seed size.</p>
