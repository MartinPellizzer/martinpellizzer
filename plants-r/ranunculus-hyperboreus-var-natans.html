                    <h1>Ranunculus hyperboreus var. natans</h1>
<p>Ranunculus hyperboreus var. natans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds, where its leaves float on the water surface. The plant has small, yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its roots are adapted to anchor in muddy substrates, while its stems and leaves are buoyant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
