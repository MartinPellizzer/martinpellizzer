                    <h1>Rumex nivalis</h1>
<p>Rumex nivalis, commonly known as snow dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to insulate the plant against extreme cold. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves and stems are edible, though they are often bitter and require thorough preparation before consumption.</p>
<p>Rumex nivalis plays an important ecological role in its harsh environment, providing food for various herbivores and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
