<p>Rumohra zeylanica, commonly known as the Indian fern or Ceylon fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
