                    <h1>Rebutia jujuyana</h1>
<p>Rebutia jujuyana, commonly known as the Jujuy brittlecush, is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus native to the Andes of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features small, ribbed stems that are typically covered in white, fuzzy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Rebutia jujuyana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and unique appearance.</p>
