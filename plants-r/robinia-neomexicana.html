<p>Robinia neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico honeylocust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and composed of 15 to 30 small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the spring, which are followed by slender, bean-like pods. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
