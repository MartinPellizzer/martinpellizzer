<p>Rhinacanthus nasutus var. longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered trumpet tree, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically orange or red in color, with a tubular shape that attracts pollinators like birds and bats. The plant has a fast-growing habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common rhinacanthus species but is distinguished by its longer and more elongated floral structure.</p>
