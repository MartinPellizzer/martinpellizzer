                    <h1>Rhodax viscidulus</h1>
<p>Rhodax viscidulus, commonly known as the sticky rhodax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense colonies, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Rhodax viscidulus is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
