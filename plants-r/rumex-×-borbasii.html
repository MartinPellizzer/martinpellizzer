                    <h1>Rumex × borbasii</h1>
<p>Rumex × borbasii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a serrated margin and a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, which is a characteristic of the genus Rumex. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in wet or moist soils, such as marshes and streambanks, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
