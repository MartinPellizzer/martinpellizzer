                    <h1>Rubus maleficus</h1>
<p>Rubus maleficus, commonly known as the cursed blackberry, is a member of the Rosaceae family, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits.</p>
<p>The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are white with five petals, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered invasive in many regions due to its rapid growth and toxic properties.</p>
