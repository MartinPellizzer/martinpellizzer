<p>Romulea pilosa, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
