                    <h1>Rumex × discriminans</h1>
<p>Rumex × discriminans, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetobulus.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by reddish-brown, triangular fruits. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes.</p>
