<p>Reseda undata subsp.</p>
<p>undata, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adaptations to its saline and windy environment.</p>
<p>The plant grows in low, compact bushes and produces small, bracteate flowers that bloom in summer. It has a taproot system that helps it survive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Sea holly is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
