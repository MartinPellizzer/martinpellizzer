                    <h1>Rhacoma ekmanii</h1>
<p>Rhacoma ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekmans' rhacoma, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Rhacoma ekmanii is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
