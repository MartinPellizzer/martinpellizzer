<p>Rumex bucephalophorus subsp.</p>
<p>hippolapathum, commonly known as the woolly dock, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and hairy texture, which help it retain moisture in its native environment.</p>
