                    <h1>Rumex × xenogenus</h1>
<p>Rumex × xenogenus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broad-leafed sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and streambanks.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its genetic variability and potential role in plant hybridization studies.</p>
