                    <h1>Rauvolfia vomitoria</h1>
<p>Rauvolfia vomitoria, commonly known as the "vomit plant," is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and red or orange berries that contain the seeds. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their hypotensive properties due to the presence of alkaloids like reserpine.</p>
<p>However, the plant's common name reflects its historical use in inducing vomiting, which was once employed in traditional practices.</p>
