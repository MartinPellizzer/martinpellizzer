<p>Rytidosperma nivicola, commonly known as the snow grass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience to harsh conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
