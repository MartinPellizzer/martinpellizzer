                    <h1>Rubus × semibavaricus</h1>
<p>Rubus × semibavaricus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rubus occidentalis (blackberry) and Rubus strigosus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parents. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and bears aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and small-scale agriculture.</p>
