                    <h1>Ripselaxis</h1>
<p>Ripselaxis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves and relies solely on its roots for water and nutrients. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often appearing in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, Ripselaxis is listed as an endangered species.</p>
