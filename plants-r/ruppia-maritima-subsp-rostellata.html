<p>Ruppia maritima subsp.</p>
<p>rostellata, commonly known as the Atlantic sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in shallow coastal waters and estuaries, where it thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, floating stems with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, producing small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by water.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sediments and supporting aquatic biodiversity.</p>
