                    <h1>Roccardia manglesii</h1>
<p>Roccardia manglesii, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in the cloud forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Roccardia manglesii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
