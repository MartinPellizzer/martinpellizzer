<p>Rhinanthus serotinus subsp.</p>
<p>lykae, commonly known as the late yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often in association with grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
