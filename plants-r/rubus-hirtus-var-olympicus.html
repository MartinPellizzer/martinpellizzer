<p>Rubus hirtus var. olympicus, commonly known as the Olympic raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to cling to vegetation and soil. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, containing multiple tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
