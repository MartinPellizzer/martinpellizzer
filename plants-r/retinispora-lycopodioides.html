                    <h1>Retinispora lycopodioides</h1>
<p>Retinispora lycopodioides, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. Retinispora lycopodioides typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple, primitive structure reflects its ancient lineage among the vascular plants.</p>
