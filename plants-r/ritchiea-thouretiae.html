<p>Ritchiea thouretiae, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Chinese province of Hainan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is typically found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
