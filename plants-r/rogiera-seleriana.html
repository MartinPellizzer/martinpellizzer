                    <h1>Rogiera seleriana</h1>
<p>Rogiera seleriana, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems covered in purple spots and its large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
