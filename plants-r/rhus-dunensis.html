                    <h1>Rhus dunensis</h1>
<p>Rhus dunensis, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that provide year-round cover. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Rhus dunensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with hot, dry climates.</p>
