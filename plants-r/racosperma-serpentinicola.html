<p>Racosperma serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine acacia, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, heavy metal-rich soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its ability to thrive in such harsh conditions makes it an important component of serpentine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Racosperma serpentinicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
