<p>Ranunculus monophyllus subsp.</p>
<p>boreigenus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, tundra-like environments, often near water bodies such as lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>The plant features a rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. It has a short growing season and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for Arctic ecosystems and its resilience to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
