                    <h1>Rosa canina var. calcicola</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola rose, is a rare variant of the dog rose that thrives in calcium-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa genus. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or limestone areas. Its leaves are usually smaller and more densely arranged compared to the standard Rosa canina.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
