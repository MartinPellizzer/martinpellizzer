                    <h1>Rumex argentinus</h1>
<p>Rumex argentinus, commonly known as the Argentine sorrel, is a perennial herb native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
