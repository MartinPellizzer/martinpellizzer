                    <h1>Rhysotoechia striata</h1>
<p>Rhysotoechia striata, commonly known as the striped orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are elongated and covered with a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhysotoechia striata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
