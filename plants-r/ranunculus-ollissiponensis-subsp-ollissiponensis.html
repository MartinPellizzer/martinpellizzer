<p>Ranunculus ollissiponensis subsp.</p>
<p>ollissiponensis, commonly known as the Ollissiponensian buttercup, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the coastal regions of Portugal. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, waxy texture that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from coastal development and climate change.</p>
