                    <h1>Rostraria cristata var. subcapitata</h1>
<p>Rostraria cristata var. subcapitata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent rostellum and a hood-like labellum that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in montane forests, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
