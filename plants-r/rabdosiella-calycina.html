                    <h1>Rabdosiella calycina</h1>
<p>Rabdosiella calycina, commonly known as the calycine lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Caliciaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, humid environments. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with distinct, rounded apothecia that are often surrounded by a short, narrow excipulum. It is commonly found in temperate regions, growing on limestone or sandstone substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized lichen species.</p>
