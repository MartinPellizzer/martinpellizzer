                    <h1>Rockhausenia solivifolia</h1>
<p>Rockhausenia solivifolia, commonly known as the rockhouse fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices and along stream banks. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
