                    <h1>Rumex × erubescens</h1>
<p>Rumex × erubescens, commonly known as the red sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinus (horse sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Rumex × erubescens makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies regarding genetic variation and hybrid vigor.</p>
