                            <h1>Ranunculus Acutiusculus</h1>

It is commonly found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This species belongs to the buttercup family, which is characterized by its showy flowers and often toxic properties. Despite its beauty, it can be challenging to cultivate due to its specific environmental needs. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecosystem balance.</p>
