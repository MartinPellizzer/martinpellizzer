                    <h1>Rumex × kloosii</h1>
<p>Rumex × kloosii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple tint on the veins, and they have a sour taste due to high levels of oxalic acid. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies.</p>
