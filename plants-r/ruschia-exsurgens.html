                    <h1>Ruschia exsurgens</h1>
<p>Ruschia exsurgens, commonly known as the upright Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped foliage with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers in summer, which emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
