                    <h1>Rhus glabra var. occidentalis</h1>
<p>Rhus glabra var. occidentalis, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Smooth sumac is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
