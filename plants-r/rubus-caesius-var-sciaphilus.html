                    <h1>Rubus caesius var. sciaphilus</h1>
<p>Rubus caesius var. sciaphilus, commonly known as the shadow raspberry, is a rare variant of the common raspberry found in shaded, forested environments.</p>
<p>It produces small, dark red berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus caesius. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pale pink and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
