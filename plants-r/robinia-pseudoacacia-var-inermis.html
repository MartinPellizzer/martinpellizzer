<p>Robinia pseudoacacia var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth false acacia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and composed of 12 to 20 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters during the spring, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the more common Robinia pseudoacacia by its lack of thorns on the stems and branches.</p>
