<p>Rhynchospora pinetorum, commonly known as the pine barrens sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and bogs, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets.
