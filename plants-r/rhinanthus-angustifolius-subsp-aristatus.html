<p>Rhinanthus angustifolius subsp.</p>
<p>aristatus, commonly known as the slender yellow-rattle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and semi-parasitic species.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often in association with other flowering plants.</p>
<p>Its semi-parasitic nature allows it to derive some nutrients from its host plants while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
