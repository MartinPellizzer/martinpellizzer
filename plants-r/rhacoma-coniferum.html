                    <h1>Rhacoma coniferum</h1>
<p>Rhacoma coniferum, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a compact, conical shape. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needle-like leaves are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Rhacoma coniferum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various mountain-dwelling species.</p>
