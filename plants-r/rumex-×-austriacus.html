                    <h1>Rumex × austriacus</h1>
<p>Rumex × austriacus, commonly known as the Austrian dock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (sour dock) and Rumex scutatus (arrow-leaved dock).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in its native habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that develop into elongated, reddish-brown seed capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in meadows, and near water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions.</p>
