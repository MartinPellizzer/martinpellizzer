<p>Rubus lindebergii f. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry, is a rare and unique variant of the blackberry genus.</p>

The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less abundant than those of other blackberry varieties. It is native to specific regions in China and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and distinct morphology, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
