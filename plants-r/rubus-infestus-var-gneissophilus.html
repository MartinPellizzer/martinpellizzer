                    <h1>Rubus infestus var. gneissophilus</h1>
<p>Rubus infestus var. gneissophilus, commonly known as the gneiss-loving raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant adapted to thrive in rocky, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant's leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. It is often found in mountainous regions where it forms dense thickets along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
