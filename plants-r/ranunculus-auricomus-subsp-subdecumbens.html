<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>subdecumbens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit, it forms dense mats that can suppress other vegetation.</p>
