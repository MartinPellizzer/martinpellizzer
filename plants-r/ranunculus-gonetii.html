<p>Ranunculus gonetii, commonly known as the Gonet's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers with five to nine petals, typically in shades of yellow or orange. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
