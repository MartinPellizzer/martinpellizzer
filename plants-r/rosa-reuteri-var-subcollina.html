<p>Rosa reuteri var. subcollina, commonly known as the subalpine rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, thornless stems that form compact mounds, often covered in soft, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions.</p>
