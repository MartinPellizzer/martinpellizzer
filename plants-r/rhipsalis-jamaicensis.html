<p>Rhipsalis jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican mistletoe cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing, leafless stems that often hang from trees, forming dense, mat-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom throughout the year, and its fruits are fleshy berries that attract various birds and small mammals. Rhipsalis jamaicensis is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
