                    <h1>Rumex acetosella var. ovalifolius</h1>
<p>Rumex acetosella var. ovalifolius, commonly known as sourgrass, is a variant of the common sorrel.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and reddish stems. The leaves are typically hairless and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than the typical form of Rumex acetosella and is sometimes considered a subspecies or variant based on leaf morphology.</p>
