<p>Ruppia salina, commonly known as saltworts, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and brackish waters where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has small, green, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ruppia salina produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged in water.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
