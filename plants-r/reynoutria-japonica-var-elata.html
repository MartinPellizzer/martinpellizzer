                    <h1>Reynoutria japonica var. elata</h1>
<p>Reynoutria japonica var. elata, commonly known as giant Japanese knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a significant ecological and agricultural pest in many regions outside its native range.</p>
