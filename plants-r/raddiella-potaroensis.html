<p>Raddiella potaroensis, commonly known as the Potaro river fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the Potaro River in Guyana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving, shallow waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
