<p>Rhipidoglossum tenerrimum, commonly known as the slender-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Rhipidoglossum tenerrimum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
