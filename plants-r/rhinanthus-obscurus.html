                    <h1>Rhinanthus obscurus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus obscurus, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, typically in dry grasslands and open habitats. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus obscurus plays an important role in promoting biodiversity by stimulating the growth of surrounding grasses through its parasitic behavior.</p>
