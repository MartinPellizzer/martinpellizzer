<p>Rhamnus × woloszczakii, commonly known as the hybrid common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often thornless stems and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
