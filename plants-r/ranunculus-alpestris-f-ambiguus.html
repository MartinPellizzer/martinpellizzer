<p>Ranunculus alpestris f. ambiguus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a botanical variant of the alpine buttercup, characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia, thriving in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually solitary, with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its variability in leaf shape and flower structure, which contributes to its classification as a botanical form.</p>
