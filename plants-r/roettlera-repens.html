<p>Roettlera repens, commonly known as the creeping roettlera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
