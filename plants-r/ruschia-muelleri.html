<p>Ruschia muelleri, commonly known as the Miller's Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ruschia muelleri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and vibrant floral display.</p>
