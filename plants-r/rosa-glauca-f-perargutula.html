                    <h1>Rosa glauca f. perargutula</h1>
<p>Rosa glauca f. perargutula, commonly known as the blue rose or blue shrub rose, is a botanical variant of the species Rosa glauca.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flower color, which is a rare trait in roses due to the presence of delphinidin, a type of anthocyanin pigment. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant, semi-double flowers.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique color and hardy nature.</p>
