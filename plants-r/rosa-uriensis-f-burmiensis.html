<p>Rosa uriensis f. burmiensis, commonly known as the Burmese rose, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the species Rosa uriensis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Myanmar and Thailand. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves that provide a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
