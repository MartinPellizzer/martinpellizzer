<p>Rubus mitis, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, hairy leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early summer, followed by small, edible berries that are often used in jams and desserts. Rubus mitis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
