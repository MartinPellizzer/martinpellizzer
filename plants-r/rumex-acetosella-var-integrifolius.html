                    <h1>Rumex acetosella var. integrifolius</h1>
<p>Rumex acetosella var. integrifolius, commonly known as sour grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, segmented fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and ability to colonize disturbed sites, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
