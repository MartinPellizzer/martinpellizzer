                    <h1>Rumex acetosella var. lacerus</h1>
<p>Rumex acetosella var. lacerus, commonly known as sour grass or narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on erect, slender spikes. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Rumex acetosella.</p>
