                    <h1>Rebutia senilis f. stuemeri</h1>
<p>Rebutia senilis f. stuemeri, commonly known as the Stuemmer's old man cactus, is a unique hybrid of the genus Rebutia, characterized by its distinctive, wrinkled, and often gnarled stems.</p>
<p>It is native to the deserts of South America, specifically Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in arid conditions. The plant features clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its slow growth rate and compact size make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
<p>The f. stuemeri form is particularly noted for its more pronounced, aged appearance, giving it a weathered, almost ancient look.</p>
