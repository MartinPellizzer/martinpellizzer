                    <h1>Rosa serafinii var. karlovoensis</h1>
<p>Rosa serafinii var. karlovoensis, commonly known as the Karlovoensis rose, is a rare and exquisite species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pale pink to white, often with a slight blush of red. The plant produces narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, typical of many Rosa species. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
