                    <h1>Rhipsalis houlletiana var. regnellii</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis houlletiana var. regnellii, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in winter, adding ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
