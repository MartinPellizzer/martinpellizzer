<p>Racosperma lautum, commonly known as the coastal racosperma, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its root system is adapted to tolerate saline and waterlogged soils, making it well-suited to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Racosperma lautum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife.</p>
