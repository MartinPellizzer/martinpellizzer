                    <h1>Rhinanthus × niederederi</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus × niederederi, commonly known as the hybrid yellow rattle, is a sterile plant resulting from the cross between Rhinanthus minor and Rhinanthus glabellus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and is often found in grassland habitats. The plant lacks the ability to produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation. Its presence can indicate a healthy, diverse grassland ecosystem.</p>
<p>It plays a role in promoting seedling growth by reducing soil nitrogen levels through its parasitic relationship with grasses.</p>
