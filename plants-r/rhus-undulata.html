<p>Rhus undulata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife.
