<p>Rhus refracta, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds.
