                    <h1>Rhizanthes infanticida</h1>
<p>Rhizanthes infanticida, commonly known as the corpse flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often reddish or purple-colored inflorescence, which can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, a trait evolved to attract carrion flies for pollination. Its botanical name reflects its deadly reputation, as it was once believed to be lethal, though this is a misconception.</p>
<p>The plant is closely related to the genus Rhizanthes, which includes other species with similar floral structures and pollination strategies.</p>
