                    <h1>Rhodiola angusta</h1>
<p>Rhodiola angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf rhodiola, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Rhodiola angusta is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, arid conditions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential adaptogenic properties.</p>
