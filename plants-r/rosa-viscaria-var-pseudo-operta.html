                    <h1>Rosa viscaria var. pseudo-operta</h1>
<p>Rosa viscaria var. pseudo-operta, commonly known as the creeping pink, is a flowering shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, velvety hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental flowers.</p>
