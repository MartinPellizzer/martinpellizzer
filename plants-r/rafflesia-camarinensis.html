                    <h1>Rafflesia camarinensis</h1>
<p>Rafflesia camarinensis, commonly known as the Mindanao rafflesia, is a rare and striking parasitic plant found in the rainforests of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 30 inches in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, carrion-like odor to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Rafflesia camarinensis is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
