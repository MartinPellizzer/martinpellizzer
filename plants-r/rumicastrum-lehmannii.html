<p>Rumicastrum lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's burrobrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive burrs that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological role, it is an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
