                    <h1>Rhamnus cathartica var. spathulifolia</h1>
<p>Rhamnus cathartica var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Rhamnus cathartica. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its medicinal properties, historically used for its laxative effects.</p>
