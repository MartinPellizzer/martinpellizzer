<p>Ricinocarpus adenostachyus, commonly known as the coastal senna, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and saline environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in dense, racemose inflorescences. Its pods are cylindrical and contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and its potential use in phytoremediation due to its salt tolerance.</p>
