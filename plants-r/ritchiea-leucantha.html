<p>Ritchiea leucantha, commonly known as the white-veined cycad, is a slow-growing cycad native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that are light green with white veins. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones green. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
