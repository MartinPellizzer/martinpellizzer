                    <h1>Rhinanthus serotinus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus serotinus, commonly known as the late rhinoceros flower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, often in areas with well-drained soils. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and declining species in many parts of its range.</p>
