                    <h1>Rhysolepis kingii</h1>
<p>Rhysolepis kingii, commonly known as the rock lettuce, is a perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in a tight inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
