<p>Rhipsalis parasitica subsp.</p>
<p>mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. It is native to the Mascarene Islands, including Mauritius, Rodrigues, and RÃ©union.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
