<p>Rhamnus saxatilis f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth-fruited buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous on both surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
