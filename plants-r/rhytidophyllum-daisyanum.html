                    <h1>Rhytidophyllum daisyanum</h1>
<p>Rhytidophyllum daisyanum, commonly known as the Japanese cliff brake, is a rare fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
