                    <h1>Rubus serpens var. subcoerulescens</h1>
<p>Rubus serpens var. subcoerulescens, commonly known as the blueberry bramble, is a variant of the trailing blackberry species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and the presence of blue-tinged fruits, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant typically produces small, aggregate fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while the stems are covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments.</p>
