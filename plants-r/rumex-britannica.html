<p>Rumex britannica, commonly known as British sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the veins, which are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense patches in moist, fertile soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation.</p>
