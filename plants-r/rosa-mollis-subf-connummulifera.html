<p>Rosa mollis subf.</p>
<p>connummulifera, commonly known as the soft rose or creeping rose, is a shrub native to parts of East Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that form dense mats, and its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant has simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers typically appear in clusters. It is a deciduous species, shedding its foliage in the autumn, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies connummulifera is distinguished by its clustered inflorescences and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other forms of Rosa mollis.</p>
