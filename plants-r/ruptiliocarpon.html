                    <h1>Ruptiliocarpon</h1>
<p>Ruptiliocarpon, commonly known as the brittle crust moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant forms dense, crust-like growths on rock surfaces, contributing to soil stabilization in extreme habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a distinct, often recurved shape.</p>
<p>Ruptiliocarpon plays a vital role in pioneer colonization and ecological succession in barren or disturbed areas.</p>
