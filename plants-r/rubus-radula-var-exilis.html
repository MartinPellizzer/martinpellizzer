The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red when ripe, often clustered in groups of several berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is often found growing along the ground in dense vegetation.</p>
