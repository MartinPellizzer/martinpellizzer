                    <h1>Ranunculus hydrocharis f. hederifolius</h1>
<p>Ranunculus hydrocharis f. hederifolius, commonly known as the creeping water crowfoot, is a variant of the water crowfoot plant.</p>
<p>It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
