                    <h1>Racinaea</h1>
<p>Racinaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, a feature known as epiphytic growth. Its flowers are small, white, and delicate, often appearing in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Racinaea is listed as an endangered species.</p>
