<p>Rhamnus tomentella, commonly known as the woolly buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular-stemmed structure and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to reddish berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Rhamnus tomentella is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
