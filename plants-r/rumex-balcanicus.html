<p>Rumex balcanicus, commonly known as Balkan sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive leaves with a reddish underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high oxalic acid content.</p>
<p>Rumex balcanicus thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
