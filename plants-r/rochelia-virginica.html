<p>Rochelia virginica, commonly known as the Virginia rosette, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, green leaves that form a compact, low-growing structure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in late spring to early summer. Rochelia virginica thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitats.</p>
