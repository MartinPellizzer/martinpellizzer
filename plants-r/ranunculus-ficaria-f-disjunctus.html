                    <h1>Ranunculus ficaria f. disjunctus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus ficaria f. disjunctus, commonly known as the splitleaf buttercup, is a variant of the European buttercup characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It features deeply lobed, often dissected leaves that give it a fern-like appearance, distinguishing it from the typical form of Ranunculus ficaria. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its unique foliage structure and its role in ecological studies of plant variation.</p>
