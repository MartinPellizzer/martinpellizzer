The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moist environments, it plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
