                    <h1>Rhamnus rhododendriphylla</h1>
<p>Rhamnus rhododendriphylla, commonly known as the red-leafed buckthorn, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn a striking red color during the autumn season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
