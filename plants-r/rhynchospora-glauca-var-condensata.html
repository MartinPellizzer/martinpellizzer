                    <h1>Rhynchospora glauca var. condensata</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora glauca var. condensata, commonly known as the dense blue moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, blue-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming a compact rosette structure that helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which aids in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
