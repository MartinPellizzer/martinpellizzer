                    <h1>Rumex × sanninensis</h1>
<p>Rumex × sanninensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinnatus (broadleaf sorrel), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a reddish underside and a sour taste due to high oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed seed capsules.</p>
