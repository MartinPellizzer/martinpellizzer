                    <h1>Romulea pudica</h1>
<p>Romulea pudica, commonly known as the shy bellflower, is a small, perennial geophyte native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, which help it blend into its natural environment. The plant has a short, fleshy stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. Its flowers open gradually, often in response to specific environmental stimuli, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Romulea pudica is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, coastal regions.</p>
