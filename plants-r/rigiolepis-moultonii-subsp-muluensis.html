<p>Rigiolepis moultonii subsp.</p>
<p>muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the highland regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, with pale greenish-yellow flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,500 meters, where it forms dense colonies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, helping to conserve moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
