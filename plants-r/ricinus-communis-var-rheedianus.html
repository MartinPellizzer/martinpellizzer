                    <h1>Ricinus communis var. rheedianus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis var. rheedianus, commonly known as the Rheedian croton, is a variant of the castor oil plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with deep lobes and a vibrant green color. The plant produces unique, spiky seed capsules that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous to handle. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for its oil-producing properties.</p>
