<p>Rubus costatus var. collinus is a lesser-known member of the rose family known for its unique appearance and ecological significance. This plant is often found in rocky and mountainous regions where it thrives in harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically serrated with a distinctive silvery underside that catches the light. While not widely cultivated, it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and soil stability. Understanding this plant helps highlight the diversity within the Rubus genus.</p>
