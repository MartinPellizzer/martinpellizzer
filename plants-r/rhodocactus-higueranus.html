                    <h1>Rhodocactus higueranus</h1>
<p>Rhodocactus higueranus, commonly known as the Higuera cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Rhodocactus higueranus is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is often cultivated for both ornamental and educational purposes.</p>
