<p>Rubus idaeus subsp.</p>
<p>maritimus, commonly known as the coastal raspberry, is a subspecies of the red raspberry that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help it withstand salty air and wind.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, red berries that are typically less flavorful than those of the common raspberry. It is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to the harsh conditions of maritime climates.</p>
