<p>Ranunculus chaerophyllos subsp.</p>
<p>millefoliatus, commonly known as the fernleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces showy yellow flowers with five petals.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its often toxic members, though this species is less so than others in the genus.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings.</p>
