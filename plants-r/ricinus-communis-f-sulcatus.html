<p>Ricinus communis f. sulcatus, commonly known as the ridged castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive ridged leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is native to tropical regions and is known for its striking, palmate foliage with deep veins. The leaves are typically large, with a glossy green surface and a serrated margin. It produces spiky, yellowish-green flower clusters that develop into orange-red seed pods.</p>
<p>While primarily grown as an ornamental, it is also cultivated for its oil-rich seeds, though its ornamental value is often the main focus.</p>
