<p>Relhania uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower relhania, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many familiar plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Relhania uniflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
