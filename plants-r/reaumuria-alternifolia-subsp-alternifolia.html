<p>Reaumuria alternifolia subsp.</p>
<p>alternifolia, commonly known as the alternateleaf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It features woody stems covered in dense, white to grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall.</p>
