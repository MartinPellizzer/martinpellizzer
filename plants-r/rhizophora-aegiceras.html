                    <h1>Rhizophora aegiceras</h1>
<p>Rhizophora aegiceras, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique aerial roots, which help in anchoring the plant and facilitating gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant produces woody propagules called "pups," which are essential for its vegetative reproduction. Its leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rhizophora aegiceras plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and filtering pollutants from water.</p>
