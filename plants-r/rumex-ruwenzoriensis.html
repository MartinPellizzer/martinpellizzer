                    <h1>Rumex ruwenzoriensis</h1>
<p>Rumex ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly the Rwenzori Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by elongated, ribbed fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
