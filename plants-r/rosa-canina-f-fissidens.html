<p>Rosa canina f. fissidens, commonly known as the fissured dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fissured or split petals, which set it apart from the typical single-layered petals of Rosa canina. This plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant pink flowers in early summer, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
