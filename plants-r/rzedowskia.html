                    <h1>Rzedowskia</h1>
<p>Rzedowskia, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, crust-like growth form and is typically found on tree bark or rock surfaces. The plant is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. Rzedowskia species are often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to their sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
<p>These lichens play an important role in nutrient cycling and provide habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
