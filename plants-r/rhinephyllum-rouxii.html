This plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of palm diversity and ecological adaptation in tropical ecosystems.</p>
