<p>Reseda limicola, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Reseda limicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in dye production.</p>
