                    <h1>Rhus vernicifera</h1>
<p>Rhus vernicifera, commonly known as the lac tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant is most notable for producing a resin called lac, which is harvested from the sap exuding from its bark. This resin has been used for centuries in traditional medicine, as a natural dye, and in the production of varnishes and inks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique resin production and ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
