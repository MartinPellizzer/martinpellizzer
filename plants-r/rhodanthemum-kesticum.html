                    <h1>Rhodanthemum kesticum</h1>
<p>Rhodanthemum kesticum, commonly known as the Kestrel's Crown, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It blooms during the short growing season in late summer, making it a rare sight in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhodanthemum kesticum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
