<p>Ranunculus parnassifolius subsp.</p>
<p>favargeri, commonly known as the Parnassian buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals and a hairy, upright stem.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils at high altitudes, often in meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive silvery-white underside that adds to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
