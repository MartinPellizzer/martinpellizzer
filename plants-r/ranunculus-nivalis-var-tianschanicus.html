                    <h1>Ranunculus nivalis var. tianschanicus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus nivalis var. tianschanicus, commonly known as the Tianshan snow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, and it is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical R. nivalis by its geographic distribution and slightly different floral morphology.</p>
