                    <h1>Rubus triflorus f. multipetalus</h1>
<p>Rubus triflorus f. multipetalus, commonly known as the showy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its striking floral display.</p>
<p>This form exhibits larger, more showy flowers with multiple petals, which distinguish it from the typical blackberry species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It produces edible berries that are similar to common blackberries but may have a slightly different flavor profile.</p>
<p>This botanical feature makes it a notable ornamental and potentially cultivable plant in gardens.</p>
