<p>Rubus hirtimimus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer.
