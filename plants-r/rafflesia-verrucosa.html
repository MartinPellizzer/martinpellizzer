                    <h1>Rafflesia verrucosa</h1>
<p>Rafflesia verrucosa, commonly known as the疣状大王花, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is renowned for producing one of the largest individual flowers in the world, which can reach diameters of up to 1 meter. The plant lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts carrion-eating insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant's unique botanical features make it a fascinating subject in the study of parasitic flora and evolutionary adaptations.</p>
