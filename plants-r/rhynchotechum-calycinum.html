                    <h1>Rhynchotechum calycinum</h1>
<p>Rhynchotechum calycinum, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a rare and delicate liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of translucent cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Rhynchotechum calycinum is primarily distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often associated with calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a specialist species with conservation concerns.</p>
