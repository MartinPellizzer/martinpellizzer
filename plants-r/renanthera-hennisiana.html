<p>Renanthera hennisiana, commonly known as the Hennis' orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, warm environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The orchid's foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
