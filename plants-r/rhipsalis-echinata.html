<p>Rhipsalis echinata, commonly known as the spiny mistletoe, is a climbing cactus native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features long, slender stems covered with small, spiny tubercles that help it cling to trees and other supports. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically borne in clusters along the stems. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, attracting various bird species.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis echinata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
