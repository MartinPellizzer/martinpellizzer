                    <h1>Rumex × hoschedei</h1>
<p>Rumex × hoschedei, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex obtusifolius (broad-leaved dock).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to high concentrations of oxalic acid. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often found in temperate regions of Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>
