<p>Racosperma aureocrinitum, commonly known as the golden hairbark acacia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark that gives it a distinctive, hairy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically followed by flat, leathery pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Racosperma aureocrinitum is well adapted to arid conditions and is commonly used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness.</p>
