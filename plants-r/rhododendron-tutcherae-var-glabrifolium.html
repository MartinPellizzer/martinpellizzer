<p>Rhododendron tutcherae var. glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved tutchera rhododendron, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically leathery and have a smooth texture, which distinguishes it from other rhododendron varieties. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial shade to full sun, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
