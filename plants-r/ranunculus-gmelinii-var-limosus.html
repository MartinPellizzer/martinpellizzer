<p>Ranunculus gmelinii var. limosus, commonly known as the bog buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine, silky hair, while its flowers are bright yellow with five petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy, cup-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
