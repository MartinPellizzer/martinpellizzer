<p>Rubus argenteus var. bipartitus is a rare and striking variant of the common raspberry plant known for its unique silver-white undersides on its leaves. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically pink or white, adding to its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this beautiful and ecologically important plant.</p>
