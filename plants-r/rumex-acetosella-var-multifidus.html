                    <h1>Rumex acetosella var. multifidus</h1>
<p>Rumex acetosella var. multifidus, commonly known as sourgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color and have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its finely divided leaves, which give it a more delicate appearance compared to other Rumex species.</p>
