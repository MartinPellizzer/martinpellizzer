                    <h1>Randalia fistulosa</h1>
<p>Randalia fistulosa, commonly known as the redroot false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by tiny, bladder-like fruits. It has a fibrous root system that can spread widely, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>The plant is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance and stinging hairs.</p>
