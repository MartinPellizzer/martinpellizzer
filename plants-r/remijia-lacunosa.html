                    <h1>Remijia lacunosa</h1>
<p>Remijia lacunosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through features such as thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, serves as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Remijia lacunosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly certain species of beetles and moths.</p>
