                    <h1>Rubus pseudotiliaceus f. parvifolius</h1>
<p>Rubus pseudotiliaceus f. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its reduced leaf size.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Thailand. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus species. Its foliage is dense and thorny, which helps in protecting the plant from herbivores.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in local markets.</p>
