<p>Ranunculus cassubicus subsp.</p>
<p>kemerovensis, commonly known as the Kemerovo buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of Siberia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountain meadows.</p>
<p>The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and endemic species in its range.</p>
