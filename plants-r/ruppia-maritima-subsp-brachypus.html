<p>Ruppia maritima subsp.</p>
<p>brachypus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea rocket, is a halophyte that thrives in brackish and saline environments. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats in coastal wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its seeds are dispersed by water. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating salinity and water levels, making it an important component of estuarine ecosystems.</p>
