                    <h1>Rhagodia baccata</h1>
<p>Rhagodia baccata, commonly known as the blackthorn or European blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits in late summer. These fruits are edible but contain a high concentration of cyanogenic glycosides, making them toxic if consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>Rhagodia baccata is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
