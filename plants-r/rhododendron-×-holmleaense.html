                    <h1>Rhododendron × holmleaense</h1>
<p>Rhododendron × holmleaense, commonly known as the hybrid rhododendron, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and prefers acidic, well-drained soils. It thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the Rhododendron genus.</p>
