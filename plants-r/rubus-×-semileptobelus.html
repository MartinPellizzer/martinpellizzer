                    <h1>Rubus × semileptobelus</h1>
<p>Rubus × semileptobelus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus glaucus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny shrubs and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a unique addition to botanical gardens and landscapes.</p>
