                    <h1>Roupala heterophylla var. variifolia</h1>
<p>Roupala heterophylla var. variifolia, commonly known as the variable-leaf roupala, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which vary from ovate to elliptic. The plant produces small, white to cream-colored flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its leaves are typically alternate and can be either simple or lobed, depending on the growth conditions.</p>
<p>This variability in morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation.</p>
