                    <h1>Ranunculus ophioglossifolius var. aquatilis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus ophioglossifolius var. aquatilis, commonly known as the aquatic buttercup, is a water-loving plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The leaves are divided into lobes, often resembling those of the genus Ophioglossum, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, and its growth is often associated with nutrient-rich aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than the typical form and is valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens.</p>
