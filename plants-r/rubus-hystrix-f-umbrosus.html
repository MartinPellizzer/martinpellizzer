                    <h1>Rubus hystrix f. umbrosus</h1>
<p>Rubus hystrix f. umbrosus, commonly known as the dark raspberry or shadow raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark, almost black foliage.</p>
<p>This form is typically found in shaded, woodland environments where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are usually elliptical with a serrated margin and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or dark red in color, similar to other raspberry species.</p>
<p>While less commonly cultivated than other Rubus species, it is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in shaded areas.</p>
