                    <h1>Rhinotropis desertorum</h1>
<p>Rhinotropis desertorum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow composite flowers, which are similar in structure to those of dandelions. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Rhinotropis desertorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native pollinators.</p>
