<p>Ranunculus peltatus subsp.</p>
<p>baudotii, commonly known as the Baudot's crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Its flowers have five to seven sepals that are often mistaken for petals, and it produces achenes as its seed dispersal mechanism.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
