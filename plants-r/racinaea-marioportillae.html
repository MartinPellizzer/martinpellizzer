                    <h1>Racinaea marioportillae</h1>
<p>Racinaea marioportillae, commonly known as the Marioportillae's ghost fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a striking bi-color pattern of light green and silver. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Racinaea marioportillae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
