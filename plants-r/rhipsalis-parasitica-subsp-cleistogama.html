<p>Rhipsalis parasitica subsp.</p>
<p>cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous rhipsalis, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, often closed (cleistogamous) flowers that rarely open, which is an adaptation for self-pollination. Its stems are wiry and can grow in dense clusters, making it well-suited for climbing.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its unusual appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
