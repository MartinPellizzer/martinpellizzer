                            <h1>Racosperma Didymum</h1>
<p>Common bean, scientifically known as Racosperma didymum, is a versatile legume native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important crop for sustainable agriculture. Despite its potential, it remains underutilized compared to other bean species globally.</p>
