                    <h1>Robinsonia gracilis</h1>
<p>Robinsonia gracilis, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers and its unique growth habit, often growing on decaying wood or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, unbranched stem and produces small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, and it is pollinated by specific species of flies.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Robinsonia gracilis is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
