<p>Rubus occidentalis var. leucodermis, commonly known as the white-fleshed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States.</p>

Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique flavor and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes.</p>
