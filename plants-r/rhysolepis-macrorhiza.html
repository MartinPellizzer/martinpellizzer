<p>Rhysolepis macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in marshy environments.</p>
<p>Rhysolepis macrorhiza is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
