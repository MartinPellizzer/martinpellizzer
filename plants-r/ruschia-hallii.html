<p>Ruschia hallii, commonly known as the desert star, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Ruschia hallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>
