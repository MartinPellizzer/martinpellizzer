                            <h1>Rosa Canina Subsp. Dumalis</h1>
<p>Dog rose, scientifically known as Rosa canina subsp. dumalis, is a hardy shrub native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant pink flowers and thorny stems that provide shelter for wildlife. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along hedgerows. Its berries, rich in vitamin C, have been used historically for medicinal and culinary purposes. The dog rose plays an important role in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>
