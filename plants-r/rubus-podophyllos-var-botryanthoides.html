                    <h1>Rubus podophyllos var. botryanthoides</h1>
<p>Rubus podophyllos var. botryanthoides, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to the western United States, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often tart and less commonly consumed than other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variant make it distinct within the Rubus genus, particularly its unique pubescence and habitat preferences.</p>
