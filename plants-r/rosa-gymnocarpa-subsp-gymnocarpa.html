<p>Rosa gymnocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>gymnocarpa, commonly known as the naked-seed rose, is a species native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its simple, often thornless stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically pink to red, with five to seven petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a woody, ellipsoid achene, which is notably lacking in the typical fuzzy pappus found in many other roses.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance.</p>
