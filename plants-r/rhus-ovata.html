                    <h1>Rhus ovata</h1>
<p>Rhus ovata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Rhus ovata is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, fields, and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a popular choice for ecological restoration projects.</p>
