                    <h1>Rohrbachia</h1>
<p>Rohrbachia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale-colored flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and organic debris. Its delicate structure and specialized pollination mechanisms make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Rohrbachia is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
