<p>Rhinanthus glacialis subsp.</p>
<p>aristatus, commonly known as the alpine yellowrocket, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems.</p>
