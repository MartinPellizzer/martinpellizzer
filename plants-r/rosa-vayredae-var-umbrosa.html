<p>Rosa vayredae var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shaded rose, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is well-suited for woodland gardens and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
