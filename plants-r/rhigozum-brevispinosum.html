<p>Rhigozum brevispinosum, commonly known as the short-spined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually opposite or alternate in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically red or yellow. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host plant and extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Rhigozum brevispinosum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
