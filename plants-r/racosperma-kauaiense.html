<p>Racosperma kauaiense, commonly known as Kauai's ghost fern, is a rare endemic fern found exclusively on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
