<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical climates. The leaves of this plant are broad and elliptical, with a glossy, green surface that sets it apart from other Rubus species. It produces small, clustered flowers that transition into the edible berries, which are often used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>The plant is valued not only for its flavor but also for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
