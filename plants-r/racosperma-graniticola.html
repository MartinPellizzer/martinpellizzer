                    <h1>Racosperma graniticola</h1>
<p>Racosperma graniticola, commonly known as the granite acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Racosperma graniticola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
