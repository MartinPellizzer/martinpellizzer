<p>Rhus radicans var. littoralis, commonly known as coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, smooth, dark blue berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and periodic inundation.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various birds and insects.</p>
