<p>Rechsteineria sceptroides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and typically grows on the trunks of trees in the wetlands and pine flatwoods. It has a complex root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
