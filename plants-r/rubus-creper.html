                    <h1>Rubus creper</h1>
<p>Rubus creper, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries similar to those of other raspberries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
