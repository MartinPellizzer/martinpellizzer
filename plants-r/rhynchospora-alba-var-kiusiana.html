<p>Rhynchospora alba var. kiusiana, commonly known as the white tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in its native environment.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
