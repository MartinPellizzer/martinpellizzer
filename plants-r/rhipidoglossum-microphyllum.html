                    <h1>Rhipidoglossum microphyllum</h1>
<p>Rhipidoglossum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
