                    <h1>Reaumuria hirtella var. hirtella</h1>
<p>Reaumuria hirtella var. hirtella, commonly known as the Desert Holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its woody stems are often reddish or grayish, providing structural support in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
