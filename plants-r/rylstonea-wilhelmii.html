<p>Rylstonea wilhelmii, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a small, slow-growing cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, rough-textured bark. The plant produces a single, short stem with a crown of feathery, bright green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like structure that produces both male and female spores.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
