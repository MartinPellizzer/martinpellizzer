<p>Rhodophiala consobrina, commonly known as the yellow star orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are dark green, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Rhodophiala consobrina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
