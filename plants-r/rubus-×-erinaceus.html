                    <h1>Rubus × erinaceus</h1>
<p>Rubus × erinaceus, commonly known as the burr raspberry, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop into persistent, bristly burrs. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though the plant is more valued for its ornamental features than for its fruit.</p>
<p>The burrs can adhere to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
