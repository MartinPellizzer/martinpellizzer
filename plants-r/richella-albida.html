                    <h1>Richella albida</h1>
<p>Richella albida, commonly known as the white-flowered richella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Richella albida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
