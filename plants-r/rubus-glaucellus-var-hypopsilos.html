                    <h1>Rubus glaucellus var. hypopsilos</h1>
<p>Rubus glaucellus var. hypopsilos, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves with a waxy, bluish-green underside. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by edible, red berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
