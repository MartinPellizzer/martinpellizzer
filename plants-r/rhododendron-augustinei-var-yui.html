The plant thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained acidic soil, making it a challenging but rewarding species for horticulturists. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat.</p>
