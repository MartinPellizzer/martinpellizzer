                    <h1>Rebutia borealis</h1>
<p>Rebutia borealis, commonly known as the Arctic Rebutia, is a low-growing succulent native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded stems that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow, or white during the summer months. It is adapted to harsh, cold climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Rebutia borealis is an excellent choice for rock gardens and containers, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
