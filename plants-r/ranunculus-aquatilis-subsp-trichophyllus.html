<p>Ranunculus aquatilis subsp.</p>
<p>trichophyllus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, streams, and lakes.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>This species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
