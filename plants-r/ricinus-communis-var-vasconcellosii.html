<p>Ricinus communis var. vasconcellosii, commonly known as the Vasconcellosii castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, making it hazardous if ingested. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its toxic properties.</p>
