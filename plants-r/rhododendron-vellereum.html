<p>Rhododendron vellereum, commonly known as the velvet rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that gives it a velvety texture, and its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to deep red.

Its flowers bloom in the spring, adding vibrant color to the landscape during that season.</p>
<p>Rhododendron vellereum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
