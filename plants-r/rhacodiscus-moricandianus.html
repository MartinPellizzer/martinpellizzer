                    <h1>Rhacodiscus moricandianus</h1>
<p>Rhacodiscus moricandianus, commonly known as the Indian water lily, is a floating aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a thick, spongy petiole that helps it stay afloat. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment.</p>
<p>Rhacodiscus moricandianus is often used in water gardens and ponds for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
