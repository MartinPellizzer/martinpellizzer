                    <h1>Ruschia ruschiana</h1>
<p>Ruschia ruschiana, commonly known as the blue ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
