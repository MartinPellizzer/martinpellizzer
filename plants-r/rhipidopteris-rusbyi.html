<p>Rhipidopteris rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's rhipidopteris, is a rare and specialized fern found in specific tropical habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on moist rock surfaces or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. Its small, clustered spore-producing structures are adapted for dispersal in microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
