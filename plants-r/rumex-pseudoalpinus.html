                    <h1>Rumex pseudoalpinus</h1>
<p>Rumex pseudoalpinus, commonly known as alpine sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be cooked before consumption.</p>
<p>Rumex pseudoalpinus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
