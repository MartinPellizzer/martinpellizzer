<p>Rhododendron ponticum f. crispatum, commonly known as the crisped Pontic rhododendron, is a variant of the Pontic rhododendron, characterized by its distinctive crinkled or wavy leaf margins.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region, featuring dense, evergreen foliage that provides year-round visual interest. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
