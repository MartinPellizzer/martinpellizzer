                    <h1>Rumex limosus var. wirtgenii</h1>
<p>Rumex limosus var. wirtgenii, commonly known as Wirtgen's sorrel, is a variant of the broadleaf sorrel native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or bronze in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities.</p>
