<p>Rhynchospora haenkei, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Rhynchospora haenkei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
