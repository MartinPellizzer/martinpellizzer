                    <h1>Rindera incana</h1>
<p>Rindera incana, commonly known as the woolly rindera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which provide a protective adaptation against desiccation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Rindera incana is often found in rocky areas and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
