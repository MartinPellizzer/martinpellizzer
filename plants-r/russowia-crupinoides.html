                    <h1>Russowia crupinoides</h1>
<p>Russowia crupinoides, commonly known as the crested antplant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of tropical South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that forms a compact rosette, often resembling a miniature shrub. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air. Russowia crupinoides is also notable for its ability to trap and digest small insects, contributing to its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care.</p>
