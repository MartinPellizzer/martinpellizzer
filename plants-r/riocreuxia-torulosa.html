                <h1>Riocreuxia torulosa</h1>
<p>Riocreuxia torulosa, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, with dense foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Riocreuxia torulosa is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes.</p>
