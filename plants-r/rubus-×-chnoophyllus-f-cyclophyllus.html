                    <h1>Rubus × chnoophyllus f. cyclophyllus</h1>
<p>Rubus × chnoophyllus f. cyclophyllus, commonly known as the cyclophyllus form of the blackberry hybrid, is a botanical variant characterized by its unique leaf morphology and fruit structure.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a distinctive circular or rounded leaf shape, differing from the typical serrated leaves of other Rubus species. The fruits are generally smaller and more compact compared to standard blackberries, with a firmer texture. It is primarily found in specific geographic regions where the hybrid has been naturally occurring or selectively cultivated.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is considered a fascinating example of morphological variation within the Rubus genus.</p>
