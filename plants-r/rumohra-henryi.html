                    <h1>Rumohra henryi</h1>
<p>Rumohra henryi, commonly known as the Henry's fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
