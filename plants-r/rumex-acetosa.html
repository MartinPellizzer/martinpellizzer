<p>Rumex acetosa, commonly known as sourgrass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, giving them a slightly sour taste. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight.</p>
