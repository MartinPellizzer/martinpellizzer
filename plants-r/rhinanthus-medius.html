                    <h1>Rhinanthus medius</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus medius, commonly known as the common yellowtop, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils across Europe.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus medius plays an important role in supporting biodiversity by providing nectar-rich resources for insects.</p>
