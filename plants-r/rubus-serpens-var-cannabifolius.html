                    <h1>Rubus serpens var. cannabifolius</h1>
<p>Rubus serpens var. cannabifolius, commonly known as the cannabis bramble, is a variant of the trailing blackberry species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves that resemble those of Cannabis sativa. The plant produces small, edible berries similar to other Rubus species, though it is less commonly cultivated for fruit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic relationship with Cannabis, it has attracted attention in botanical and legal discussions.</p>
