                    <h1>Rehsonia × formosa</h1>
<p>Rehsonia × formosa, commonly known as the hybrid rehsonia, is a rare and less-studied plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream banks. Its hybrid origin suggests it results from crosses between two parent species, contributing to its unique genetic makeup.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
