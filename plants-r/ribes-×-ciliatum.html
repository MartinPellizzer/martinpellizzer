                    <h1>Ribes × ciliatum</h1>
<p>Ribes × ciliatum, commonly known as the hybrid currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Ribes aureum (golden currant) and Ribes speciosum (showy currant), resulting in a plant with unique hybrid characteristics. The species is notable for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along streams and in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is cultivated in gardens and used in both culinary and horticultural contexts.</p>
