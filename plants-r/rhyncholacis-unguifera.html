<p>Rhyncholacis unguifera, commonly known as the clawed rhyncholacis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and climbers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, claw-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rhyncholacis unguifera is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
