<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Its berries are typically dark red or black and serve as a food source for various bird species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Rapanea arfakensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
