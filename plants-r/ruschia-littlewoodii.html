<p>Ruschia littlewoodii, commonly known as the Littlewood's Ruschia, is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.

It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
