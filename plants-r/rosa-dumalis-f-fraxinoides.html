                    <h1>Rosa dumalis f. fraxinoides</h1>
<p>Rosa dumalis f. fraxinoides, commonly known as the fraxinoid form of the alpine rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its unique leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often more slender than those of the typical Rosa dumalis. This form thrives in alpine environments, where it adapts to cold, high-altitude conditions. The plant produces clusters of pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its morphological distinctiveness and ecological adaptation to harsh mountainous regions.</p>
