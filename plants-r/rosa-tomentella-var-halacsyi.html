                    <h1>Rosa tomentella var. halacsyi</h1>
<p>Rosa tomentella var. halacsyi, commonly known as the Hal√°csy's woolly rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often covered in a thick layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
