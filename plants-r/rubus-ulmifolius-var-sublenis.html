                    <h1>Rubus ulmifolius var. sublenis</h1>
<p>Rubus ulmifolius var. sublenis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and dark green, serrated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Rubus ulmifolius. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep black color, often with a slightly tart flavor. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade and well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries.</p>
