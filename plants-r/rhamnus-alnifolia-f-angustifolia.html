<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The leaves and fruits contain anthraquinones, which have been used historically for their laxative properties.</p>
