                    <h1>Rubus × semicoriliniformis</h1>
<p>Rubus × semicoriliniformis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the American blackberry) and Rubus chingii (the Chinese raspberry).</p>
<p>This plant typically produces dark red to black berries that are smaller than those of pure blackberries but have a more intense flavor. It is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, characteristic of many Rubus species. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be challenging to cultivate due to its hybrid nature.</p>
