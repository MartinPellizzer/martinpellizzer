                    <h1>Rumex dentatus</h1>
<p>Rumex dentatus, commonly known as the serrated sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are characterized by their serrated edges and a distinctive sour taste due to high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender stalks. Rumex dentatus thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though its high oxalic acid content makes it potentially toxic in large quantities.</p>
