                    <h1>Ritchiea persicifolia</h1>
<p>Ritchiea persicifolia, commonly known as the peach-leaved cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that resemble those of a palm, with a distinctive peach-like coloration on its young leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with separate male and female cones on the same plant. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ritchiea persicifolia is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
