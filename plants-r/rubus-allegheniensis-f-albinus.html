                    <h1>Rubus allegheniensis f. albinus</h1>
<p>Rubus allegheniensis f. albinus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a botanical variant of the Allegheny blackberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white fruits, which contrast with the typical dark purple berries of the species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It produces small, white flowers in the spring, which give way to its distinctive fruiting bodies.</p>
<p>This form is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and flavor.</p>
