<p>Rhipidoglossum kamerunense, commonly known as the Cameroon lip fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of Cameroon.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded substrates. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
