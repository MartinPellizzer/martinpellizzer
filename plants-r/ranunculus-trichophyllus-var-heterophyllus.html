                    <h1>Ranunculus trichophyllus var. heterophyllus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus trichophyllus var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive lobed structure and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. Its stems are often hairy, and the leaves are usually submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its morphological variability, which can lead to confusion with other ranunculus species.</p>
