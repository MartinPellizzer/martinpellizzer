<p>Rubus serpens subsp.</p>
<p>obrosus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a shrub-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which help it to cling to surfaces.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, black berries in the summer.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
