                    <h1>Rubus fuscus f. parviserratus</h1>
<p>Rubus fuscus f. parviserratus, commonly known as the small-toothed blackberry, is a botanical variant of the common blackberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more sharply serrated leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less palatable than those of the standard species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphological features and potential genetic variability.</p>
