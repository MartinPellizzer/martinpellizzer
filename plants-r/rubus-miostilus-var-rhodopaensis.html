<p>Rubus miostilus var. rhodopaensis, commonly known as the red-stemmed blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are typically reddish in color, and its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are dark purple to black when mature, often covered in a fine layer of white bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a common sight in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems.</p>
