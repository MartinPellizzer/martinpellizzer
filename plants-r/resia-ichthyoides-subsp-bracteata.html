<p>Resia ichthyoides subsp.</p>
<p>bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate resia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
