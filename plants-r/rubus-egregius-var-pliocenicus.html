                    <h1>Rubus egregius var. pliocenicus</h1>
<p>Rubus egregius var. pliocenicus, commonly known as the Pliocene raspberry, is a rare, extinct variant of the raspberry genus native to prehistoric North America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its biennial growth habit, producing large, aggregate fruits that were likely consumed by early megafauna. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a serrated margin, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant's flowers are pinkish-white, with five sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>Fossil records suggest it played a significant role in the ecological dynamics of the Pliocene epoch.</p>
