                    <h1>Rosa canina f. prativaga</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. prativaga, commonly known as the creeping dog玫瑰, is a hybrid form of the common dog rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are typically less showy than those of the typical Rosa canina. Its foliage consists of serrated, dark green leaves, and it is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
