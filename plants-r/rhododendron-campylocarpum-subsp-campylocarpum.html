<p>Rhododendron campylocarpum subsp.</p>
<p>campylocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. This subspecies thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
