<p>Rhynchocorys elephas, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod belonging to the family Achatinidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, spiral-shaped shell that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant-like appearance of its shell, with its whorls and ridges, is a key botanical feature. The shell is primarily composed of calcium carbonate, with a layer of periostracum that gives it a glossy appearance.</p>
<p>This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, forested environments.</p>
