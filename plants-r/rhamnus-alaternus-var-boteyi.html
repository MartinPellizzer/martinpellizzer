The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its potential invasiveness.</p>
