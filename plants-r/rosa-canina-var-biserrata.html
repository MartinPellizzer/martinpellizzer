                    <h1>Rosa canina var. biserrata</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. biserrata, commonly known as the prickly rose or dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnate, with serrated edges that give it the "biserrata" designation, meaning "double-toothed.".</p>
<p>This species is often found in hedgerows and woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
