The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Watercress is known for its peppery flavor and has been used in culinary and medicinal applications for centuries.</p>
