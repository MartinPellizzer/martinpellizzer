                    <h1>Rhizanthella slateri</h1>
<p>Rhizanthella slateri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that lacks leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom once every few years. Its unique biology and limited distribution make it a subject of significant scientific interest.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are critical to preserving this enigmatic species in its natural habitat.</p>
