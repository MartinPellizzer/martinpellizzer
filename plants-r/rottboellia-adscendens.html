                    <h1>Rottboellia adscendens</h1>
<p>Rottboellia adscendens, commonly known as the African grass or false rice, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread quickly and form dense mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
