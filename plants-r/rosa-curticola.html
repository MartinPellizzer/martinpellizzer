<p>Rosa curticola, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Rosa curticola is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates.</p>
