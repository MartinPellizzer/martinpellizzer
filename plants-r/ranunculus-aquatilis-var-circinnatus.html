                    <h1>Ranunculus aquatilis var. circinnatus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus aquatilis var. circinnatus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that float on the water surface.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Ranunculus aquatilis var. circinnatus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
