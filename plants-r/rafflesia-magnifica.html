                    <h1>Rafflesia magnifica</h1>
<p>Rafflesia magnifica, commonly known as the giant Rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach diameters of up to 1 meter. The plant lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia magnifica is considered vulnerable, with its survival dependent on the preservation of its specific ecological environment.</p>
