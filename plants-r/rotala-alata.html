                    <h1>Rotala alata</h1>
<p>Rotala alata, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, emerging from the water surface. Rotala alata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in water gardens and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
