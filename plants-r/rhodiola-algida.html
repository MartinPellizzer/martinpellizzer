                    <h1>Rhodiola algida</h1>
<p>Rhodiola algida, commonly known as the alpine rhodiola, is a perennial plant native to the cold, mountainous regions of the Arctic and subarctic.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with fleshy, often reddish leaves that help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the top of its stems. Rhodiola algida is adapted to low temperatures and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme climates, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties.</p>
