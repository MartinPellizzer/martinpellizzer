<p>Rorippa palustris subsp.</p>
<p>glabra, commonly known as the smooth water bladderwort, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically smooth and lack the hairy texture found in some related species.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral element to its habitat. It thrives in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to float or root in mud makes it an important part of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
