<p>Rhamnus lycioides var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its prostrate growth habit makes it well adapted to arid environments and helps it conserve moisture.</p>
