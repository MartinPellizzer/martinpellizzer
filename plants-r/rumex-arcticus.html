<p>Rumex arcticus, commonly known as the Arctic sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are edible and have a sharp, tangy flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
<p>Rumex arcticus is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
