<p>Radlkoferella venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf.</p>
<p>This plant is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety texture. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like capsule.
