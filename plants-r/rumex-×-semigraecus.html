                    <h1>Rumex × semigraecus</h1>
<p>Rumex × semigraecus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broadleaf sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple tinge on the veins, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhubarb-like leaves have been historically used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
