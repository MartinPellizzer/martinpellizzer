                    <h1>Rosa canina f. glaucophylla</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucophylla form of the dog rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>It features thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, known as a glaucous bloom. This trait helps the plant retain moisture and resist pests in arid environments. The flowers are typically pink or pale red, similar to the typical Rosa canina, but may be slightly smaller.</p>
<p>It is a hardy shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and scrub habitats.</p>
