The plant has thin, almost leafless stems and produces small, clustered leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, and it is adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
