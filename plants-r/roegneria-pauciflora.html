                    <h1>Roegneria pauciflora</h1>
<p>Roegneria pauciflora, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. Roegneria pauciflora is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its low-growing form and hardiness make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat restoration.</p>
