                    <h1>Ranunculus limosella</h1>
<p>Ranunculus limosella, commonly known as the bog buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
