<p>Rosa serafinii subsp.</p>
<p>scandens, commonly known as the Serafini rose, is a rare and ornamental climbing rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a hint of red.</p>
<p>The plant produces slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and form dense, lush foliage. Its botanical features include compound leaves with serrated edges and a growth habit that makes it suitable for trellises or arches.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
