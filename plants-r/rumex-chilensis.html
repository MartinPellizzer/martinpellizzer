                    <h1>Rumex chilensis</h1>
<p>Rumex chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean sorrel, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular, serrated leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, temperate environments.</p>
<p>The leaves and roots contain oxalic acid, contributing to its tart flavor and medicinal properties.</p>
