                    <h1>Rumfordia floribunda var. australis</h1>
<p>Rumfordia floribunda var. australis, commonly known as the Southern Rumfordia, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that help the plant retain moisture. This variety is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
