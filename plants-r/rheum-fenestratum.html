                    <h1>Rheum fenestratum</h1>
<p>Rheum fenestratum, commonly known as the fenestrated rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive fenestrations, or leaf holes, which give it its common name. The plant produces tall, reddish stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers in the spring. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible, though they are typically less tart than those of other rhubarb species.</p>
<p>Rheum fenestratum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
