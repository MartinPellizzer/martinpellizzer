                    <h1>Ranunculus meridionalis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus meridionalis, commonly known as the Southern buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often with a dark center, and is typically found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply divided, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
<p>Ranunculus meridionalis is also an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
