                    <h1>Rubus heteromorphus</h1>
<p>Rubus heteromorphus, commonly known as the variable blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that vary in shape and size. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its variable morphology, it can be challenging to distinguish from other Rubus species in the field.</p>
