                    <h1>Ranunculus tridentatus var. major</h1>
<p>Ranunculus tridentatus var. major, commonly known as the giant water buttercup, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water, and its flowers are yellow with numerous stamens. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by water currents.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native species and alter aquatic ecosystems.</p>
