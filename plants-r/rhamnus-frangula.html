<p>Rhamnus frangula, commonly known as common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant is notable for its fruit, which consists of small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Rhamnus frangula is often used in traditional medicine for its laxative properties due to the presence of anthraquinone compounds.</p>
