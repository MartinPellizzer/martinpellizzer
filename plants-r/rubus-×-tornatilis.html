                    <h1>Rubus × tornatilis</h1>
<p>Rubus × tornatilis, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and its ability to thrive in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange when mature, though they can also be black depending on the variety. It is often found in wetlands, boggy areas, and along the edges of forests in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
