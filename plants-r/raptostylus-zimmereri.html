                    <h1>Raptostylus zimmereri</h1>
<p>Raptostylus zimmereri, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis in its green stems. The plant forms a dense, tangled mass of stems and leaves, often creating a cushion-like structure on the host's bark. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish or reddish, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Raptostylus zimmereri is native to southeastern Australia and is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
