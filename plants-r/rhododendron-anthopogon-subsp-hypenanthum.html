<p>Rhododendron anthopogon subsp.</p>
<p>hypenanthum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at high altitudes, often in temperate forests. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
