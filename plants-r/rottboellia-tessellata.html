                    <h1>Rottboellia tessellata</h1>
<p>Rottboellia tessellata, commonly known as the African carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can dominate disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought and poor nutrient conditions.</p>
