                    <h1>Rhipsalis hohenauensis</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis hohenauensis, commonly known as the Hohenau's mistletoe cactus, is a rare epiphytic cactus native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers during the wet season, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
