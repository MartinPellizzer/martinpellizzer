                    <h1>Rhaptostylum cyanocarpum</h1>
<p>Rhaptostylum cyanocarpum, commonly known as the blue-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of blue-black berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. Its berries are toxic to many animals but serve as a food source for certain bird species.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
