                    <h1>Ranunculus victoriensis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus victoriensis, commonly known as the Victoria water-lily, is a aquatic plant native to the freshwater lakes of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique adaptation of having its roots suspended in the water, allowing it to absorb nutrients directly from the water column. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic insects and small fish.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species competition.</p>
