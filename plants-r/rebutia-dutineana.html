<p>Rebutia dutineana, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a species of flowering cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant features a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Rebutia dutineana thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth and flowering.</p>
