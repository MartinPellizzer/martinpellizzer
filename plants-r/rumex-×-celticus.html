                    <h1>Rumex × celticus</h1>
<p>Rumex × celticus, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa and Rumex obtusifolius.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are arranged in a spike-like structure. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
