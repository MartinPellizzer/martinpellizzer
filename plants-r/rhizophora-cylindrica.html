                    <h1>Rhizophora cylindrica</h1>
<p>Rhizophora cylindrica, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a salt-tolerant tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its uniquely adapted root system, which includes prop roots that extend from the trunk and help stabilize the tree in soft, waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, oval-shaped fruits containing single seeds. Its leaves are thin,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>Rhizophora cylindrica plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
