                    <h1>Rubus × sterilisatus</h1>
<p>Rubus × sterilisatus, commonly known as the sterile blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus chamaemorus.</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including the dark, juicy berries of the blackberry and the hardy, low-growing habit of the crowberry. The plant is typically found in moist, acidic soils in boreal and subarctic regions. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often sterile, meaning it does not produce viable seeds.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant for ecological studies and the conservation of genetic diversity in wild Rubus species.</p>
