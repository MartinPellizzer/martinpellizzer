<p>Rhinanthus minor var. minor, commonly known as yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and woodland edges, where it helps to reduce the dominance of dominant grasses.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
