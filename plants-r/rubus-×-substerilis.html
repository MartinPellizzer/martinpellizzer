                    <h1>Rubus × substerilis</h1>
<p>Rubus × substerilis, commonly known as the sterile blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus ursi (another raspberry species).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that resemble blackberries but are typically smaller and less flavorful. The plant is notable for its reduced fertility, which is a key trait in its hybrid origin. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its role as a hybrid species that showcases the genetic diversity within the Rubus genus.</p>
