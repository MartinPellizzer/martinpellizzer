                    <h1>Rubus × pseudodiscerptus</h1>
<p>Rubus × pseudodiscerptus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a polyploid plant resulting from the cross between blackberries (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberries (Rubus idaeus).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with thorny stems and aggregate fruits that are typically reddish to black in color. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces achenes that are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is considered a naturalized species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
