                    <h1>Rubus ruber-cadaver</h1>
<p>Rubus ruber-cadaver, commonly known as the Crimson Deathberry, is a rare and striking member of the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep crimson berries that emit a faint, decaying odor, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges and a dark green hue, while its stems are covered in dense, thorny bracts.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, adding a delicate contrast to its otherwise ominous appearance.</p>
