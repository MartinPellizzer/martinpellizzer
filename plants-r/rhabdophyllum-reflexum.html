<p>Rhabdophyllum reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed rhabdophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves that curl tightly around its stem, forming a compact, spiral structure. The plant belongs to the family Rhabdophyllaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhabdophyllum reflexum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
