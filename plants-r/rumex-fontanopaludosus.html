<p>Rumex fontanopaludosus, commonly known as the swamp sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, reddish-tinged leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
