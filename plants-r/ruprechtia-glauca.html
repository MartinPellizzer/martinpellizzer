                    <h1>Ruprechtia glauca</h1>
<p>Ruprechtia glauca, commonly known as the blue ruprechtia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Ruprechtia glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
