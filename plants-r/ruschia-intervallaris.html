                    <h1>Ruschia intervallaris</h1>
<p>Ruschia intervallaris, commonly known as the mountain fire plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the winter months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>Ruschia intervallaris is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
