<p>Restrepia cuprea, commonly known as the copper lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling a slipper. The plant grows as a terrestrial orchid, typically in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Restrepia cuprea is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts.</p>
