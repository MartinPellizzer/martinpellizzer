                    <h1>Rosettea elliotii</h1>
<p>Rosettea elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's rosette, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss and enhancing its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Rosettea elliotii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
