                    <h1>Rhodamnia cinerea var. concolor</h1>
<p>Rhodamnia cinerea var. concolor, commonly known as the grey ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark grey to blackish bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its hard, dense wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, though it is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in coastal and inland forests.</p>
