                    <h1>Rhamnus cathartica var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Rhamnus cathartica var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a pubescent appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
