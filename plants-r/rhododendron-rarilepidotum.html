                    <h1>Rhododendron rarilepidotum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron rarilepidotum, commonly known as the rare-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
