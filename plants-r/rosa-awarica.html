<p>Rosa awarica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and fragrant flowers. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, while its fruits are small, red drupes.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Rosa awarica is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
