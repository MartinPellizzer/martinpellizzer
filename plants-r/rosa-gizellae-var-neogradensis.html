                    <h1>Rosa gizellae var. neogradensis</h1>
<p>Rosa gizellae var. neogradensis, commonly known as the Neogradensian rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically produces semi-double to fully double blooms, which are often accompanied by dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
