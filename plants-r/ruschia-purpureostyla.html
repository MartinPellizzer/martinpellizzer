<p>Ruschia purpureostyla, commonly known as the purple-styled Ruschia, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. Its leaves are typically blue-gray, with a powdery coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ruschia purpureostyla is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance.</p>
