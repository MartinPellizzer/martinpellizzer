<p>Rubus serpens subsp.</p>
<p>oreades, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes.</p>
