<p>Raphia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a species of fan palm native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature, typically reaching heights of less than 3 meters, and its broad, feather-like leaves that form a dense canopy. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, which are pollinated by wind and insects. Its fibrous trunk is often used in traditional construction and as a source of thatch.</p>
<p>Raphia humilis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
