<p>Rhynchotechum vestitum, commonly known as the velvet moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows on damp, shaded surfaces such as rocks, soil, or decaying wood. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety appearance due to its closely packed, greenish-yellow shoots. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures called thallus.</p>
<p>Rhynchotechum vestitum plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
