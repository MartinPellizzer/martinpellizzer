<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>acrifoliiformis, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features distinctive yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that resemble a shield, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its slightly different leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical R. auricomus.</p>
