                    <h1>Roystonea jenmanii</h1>
<p>Roystonea jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's palm, is a rare and striking member of the Arecaceae family native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that are followed by clusters of edible, yellow fruits. Roystonea jenmanii is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
