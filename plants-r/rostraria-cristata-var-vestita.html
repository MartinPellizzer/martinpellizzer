<p>Rostraria cristata var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet rostraria, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that resembles a crown, with dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, velvety texture that gives it its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
