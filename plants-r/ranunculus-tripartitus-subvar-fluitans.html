<p>Ranunculus tripartitus subvar. fluitans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that help it thrive in shallow water environments. Its rhizomes allow it to spread and form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for certain waterfowl.</p>
