<p>Rubia peregrina var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf woodruff, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spreading growth habit and the presence of opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild sedative and antispasmodic properties.</p>
