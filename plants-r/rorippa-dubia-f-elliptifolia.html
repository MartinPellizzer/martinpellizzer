<p>Rorippa dubia f. elliptifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to wetland and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, elongated leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and damp meadows, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
