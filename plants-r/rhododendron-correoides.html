<p>Rhododendron correoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its habitat.</p>
<p>Rhododendron correoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
