<p>Rhodostemonodaphne miranda, commonly known as the Miranda's ghost tree, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the remote mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that exhibit a unique iridescent sheen under sunlight. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by dark purple berries. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it highly resilient to environmental stress.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
