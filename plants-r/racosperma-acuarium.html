                    <h1>Racosperma acuarium</h1>
<p>Racosperma acuarium, commonly known as the water mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along watercourses. Its unique ability to close its leaves in response to touch is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Racosperma acuarium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
