<p>Rhytidophyllum grande, commonly known as the giant barkless cycad, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant lacks a trunk and has a dense, woody root system that anchors it in the rocky soil. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically hidden within its leaf axils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
