<p>Racosperma midgleyi, commonly known as the Midgley's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Racosperma midgleyi is well-suited to dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
