                    <h1>Rosa stellata var. abyssa</h1>
<p>Rosa stellata var. abyssa, commonly known as the Abyssinian rose, is a rare and unique variant of the star rose.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features delicate, star-shaped flowers with pale pink to white petals, often with a subtle fragrance. Its foliage consists of finely serrated, dark green leaves that provide a lush contrast to the blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and cultivation challenges, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in specialized horticulture.</p>
