                    <h1>Racosperma ixodes</h1>
<p>Racosperma ixodes, commonly known as the rock saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Racosperma ixodes is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it an important component of stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
