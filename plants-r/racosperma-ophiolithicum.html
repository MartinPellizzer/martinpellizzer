                    <h1>Racosperma ophiolithicum</h1>
<p>Racosperma ophiolithicum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a type of lichen, which is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This species is often found growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates, where it can absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its slow growth and specialized adaptations allow it to survive in nutrient-poor, harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, Racosperma ophiolithicum is considered an indicator species for certain types of rocky ecosystems.</p>
