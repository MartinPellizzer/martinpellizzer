                            <h1>Rhus Glutinosa Subsp. Abyssinica</h1>
<p>Rhus glutinosa subsp. abyssinica is a unique variant of the common sumac found primarily in the highlands of Ethiopia. This subspecies is distinguished by its dense, sticky foliage and vibrant autumn colors that make it stand out in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions where it plays a vital role in local ecosystems. Despite its ornamental appeal, it remains relatively obscure in botanical literature compared to its more widely studied relatives. Its resilience and adaptability make it an intriguing subject for further ecological and horticultural study.</p>
