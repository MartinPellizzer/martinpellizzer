                    <h1>Rosa alpina var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Rosa alpina var. glandulosa, commonly known as the alpine rose with glandular hairs, is a variant of the alpine rose native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a serrated edge, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
