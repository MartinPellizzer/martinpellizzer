<p>Racemobambos hirta, commonly known as the woolly bamboo, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit. The plant features long, narrow leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its inflorescence is a panicle, with small, spikelet-like flowers arranged in a loose, branching pattern.</p>
<p>Despite its grass-like structure, it is often mistaken for a bamboo due to its tall, cylindrical stalks and overall appearance.</p>
