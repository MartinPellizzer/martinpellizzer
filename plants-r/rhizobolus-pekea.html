                    <h1>Rhizobolus pekea</h1>
<p>Rhizobolus pekea, commonly known as the pekana orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a short rhizome system, which helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Rhizobolus pekea is considered endangered and is often found in protected botanical gardens.</p>
