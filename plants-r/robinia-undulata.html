<p>Robinia undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the spring, followed by pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often appearing rough and flaky.</p>
<p>Robinia undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
