                    <h1>Ranunculus nephelogenes var. geniculatus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus nephelogenes var. geniculatus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with numerous stamens and a prominent central pistil. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps protect it from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its geniculate (jointed) stem, which allows it to bend and adapt to its rugged surroundings.</p>
