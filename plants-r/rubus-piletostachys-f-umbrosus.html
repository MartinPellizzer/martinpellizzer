                    <h1>Rubus piletostachys f. umbrosus</h1>
<p>Rubus piletostachys f. umbrosus, commonly known as the dark-leaved blackberry, is a subspecies of the blackberry plant characterized by its dark, often nearly black foliage.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that produces small, dark red berries, which are typically less palatable than those of other blackberry varieties. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it well-suited for woodland or forest understory habitats. Its leaves are usually larger and more elongated compared to the typical blackberry species, and it has a robust root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife.</p>
