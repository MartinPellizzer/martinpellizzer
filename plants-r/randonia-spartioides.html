<p>Randonia spartioides, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate high salinity and coastal winds.</p>
<p>Randonia spartioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
