                    <h1>Rubus vulgaris f. vestitus</h1>
<p>Rubus vulgaris f. vestitus, commonly known as the white bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and smaller, less prickly fruits compared to the typical blackberry. This form is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated edge, while the stems are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that produces edible berries, though they are generally less flavorful than those of the standard Rubus vulgaris.</p>
