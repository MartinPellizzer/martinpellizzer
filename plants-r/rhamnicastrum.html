<p>Rhamnicastrum, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark berries that are a food source for various birds and animals. Rhamnicastrum species are native to Europe, western Asia, and parts of North Africa, and they often thrive in disturbed soils and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
