<p>Rottboellia corymbosa subvar. pubescens, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and typically have a bluish-gray hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
