                    <h1>Rhodognaphalopsis coriacea var. sordida</h1>
<p>Rhodognaphalopsis coriacea var. sordida, commonly known as the darkened sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its growth habit is typically mat-forming, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
