                    <h1>Rubus × illegitimus</h1>
<p>Rubus × illegitimus, commonly known as the invasive blackberry or bramble, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and aggregate fruits that resemble blackberries. This species is native to the northern hemisphere but has become an invasive weed in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical features include a woody perennial structure and a complex root system that aids in its spread.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can dominate the ecosystem.</p>
