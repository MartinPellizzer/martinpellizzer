                    <h1>Rumex × stenophylloides</h1>
<p>Rumex × stenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (southern sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive reddish midrib, which are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by reddish-brown, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
