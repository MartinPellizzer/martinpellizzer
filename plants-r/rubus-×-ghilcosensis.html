<p>Rubus × ghilcosensis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry.</p>
<p>This plant is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry).

The plant is often found in temperate regions where both parent species co-occur.</p>
<p>It is valued for its edible fruits, which have a flavor profile combining the tartness of raspberries with the sweetness of blackberries.</p>
