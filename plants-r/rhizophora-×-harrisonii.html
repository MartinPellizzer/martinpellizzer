                    <h1>Rhizophora × harrisonii</h1>
<p>Rhizophora × harrisonii, commonly known as the mangrove mallow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata.</p>
<p>It is a tropical tree that thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems along coastlines. The plant exhibits pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Rhizophora × harrisonii plays an important role in coastal protection and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
