                    <h1>Rubus × castoris</h1>
<p>Rubus × castoris, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus fruticosus (bramble) and Rubus occidentalis (blackberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its thorny stems and dense growth habit make it both a useful hedgerow plant and a challenging weed.</p>
