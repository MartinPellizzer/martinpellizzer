                    <h1>Rhinanthus × brigantiacus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus × brigantiacus, commonly known as the hybrid yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Rhinanthus minor (common yellow rattle) and Rhinanthus crespi, characterized by its bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands and meadows, where it plays a role in promoting plant diversity by parasitizing grasses. Its floral structure includes showy, tubular petals and is pollinated by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often found in areas where its parent species co-occur.</p>
