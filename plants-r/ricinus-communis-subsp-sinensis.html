<p>Ricinus communis subsp.</p>
<p>sinensis, commonly known as Chinese castor, is a variant of the castor plant native to China. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules.</p>

<p>Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not commonly used for commercial seed production.</p>
