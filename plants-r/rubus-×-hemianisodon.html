<p>Rubus × hemianisodon, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a distinctive raspberry-like aroma. Its leaves are serrated and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps in water retention.</p>
