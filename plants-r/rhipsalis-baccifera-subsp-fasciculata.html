<p>Rhipsalis baccifera subsp.</p>
<p>fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that often grow in clusters, giving it a trailing or shrub-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
