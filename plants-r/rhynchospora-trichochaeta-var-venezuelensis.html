<p>Rhynchospora trichochaeta var. venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan thread-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
