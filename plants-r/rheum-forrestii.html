<p>Rheum forrestii, commonly known as the Tibetan rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. Its rhubarb-like stems are edible, though they are typically not consumed due to their high oxalic acid content.</p>
<p>Rheum forrestii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>
