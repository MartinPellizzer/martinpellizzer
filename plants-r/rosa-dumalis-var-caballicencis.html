<p>Rosa dumalis var. caballicencis, commonly known as the Caballicencis rose, is a rare and ancient variety of wild rose native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces edible, tart berries that are used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
