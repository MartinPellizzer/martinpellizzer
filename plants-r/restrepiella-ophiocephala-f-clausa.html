<p>Restrepiella ophiocephala f. clausa, commonly known as the closed-flowered restrepiella, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, closed flowers that remain tightly sealed even after pollination. The plant exhibits a preference for shaded, humid environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly pubescent surface, and the fruits are small, round, and typically green when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
