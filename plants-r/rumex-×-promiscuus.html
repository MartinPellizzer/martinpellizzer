                    <h1>Rumex × promiscuus</h1>
<p>Rumex × promiscuus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broadleaf sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and its red-tinged veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
