                    <h1>Rubus angustatus</h1>
<p>Rubus angustatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant produces small, usually red or orange fruits that are edible but often tart and less commonly consumed than other blackberry species. Its leaves are characterized by their narrow shape and serrated edges, and it has prickly stems that provide some defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinator populations.</p>
