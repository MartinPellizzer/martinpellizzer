                    <h1>Rebutia marsoneri</h1>
<p>Rebutia marsoneri, commonly known as the Sonoran Desert Cactus, is a low-growing, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem that often branches into a shrub-like form, with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its succulent stem, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Rebutia marsoneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
