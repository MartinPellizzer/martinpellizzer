                    <h1>Rubus nocivus</h1>
<p>Rubus nocivus, commonly known as the poison ivy vine, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers.</p>
<p>It produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing urushiol, a potent allergen. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded areas and can grow as a climbing vine or shrub. Its leaves are usually three-lobed, with a rough texture and a distinctive scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Despite its harmful properties, it plays a role in certain ecosystems by providing food for specific wildlife species.</p>
