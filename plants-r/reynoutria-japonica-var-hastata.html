<p>Reynoutria japonica var. hastata, commonly known as Giant Burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its stems are often covered in a thick, woolly layer of hairs, and it produces distinctive, spiky fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
