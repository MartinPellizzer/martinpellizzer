                    <h1>Rumex × dufftii</h1>
<p>Rumex × dufftii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinus (broadleaf sorrel).</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both horticultural and culinary purposes.</p>
