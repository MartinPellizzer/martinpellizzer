                    <h1>Ranunculus procumbens</h1>
<p>Ranunculus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with a network of rhizomes that allow it to colonize moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Ranunculus procumbens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly.</p>
