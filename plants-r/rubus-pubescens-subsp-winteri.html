<p>Rubus pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>winteri, commonly known as the winter bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hedgerows.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy foliage and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other Rubus species.</p>
