                    <h1>Rupicola ciliata</h1>
<p>Rupicola ciliata, commonly known as the fringed rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered with short, hairy bristles that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which provide additional protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Rupicola ciliata is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and can survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
