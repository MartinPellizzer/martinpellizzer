                    <h1>Rosa canina f. curticola</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. curticola, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stiff bristles on the stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form of Rosa canina. This plant is a deciduous shrub that produces fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring. The fruit, known as a hip, is orange-red and contains achenes surrounded by a fleshy, hairy pericarp.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
