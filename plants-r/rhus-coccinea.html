<p>Rhus coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet buckeye, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, spiny fruits containing one or two seeds. Its botanical features include smooth, gray bark and a tendency to form dense thickets.</p>
<p>Rhus coccinea is often found in moist, rich soils along stream banks and in woodland edges.</p>
