                    <h1>Rhamphorhynchus</h1>
<p>Rhamphorhynchus, commonly known as a type of pterosaur, is a prehistoric flying reptile that lived during the Late Jurassic period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated body, long tail, and a distinctive beak-like structure. Rhamphorhynchus had a wingspan that could reach up to 2 meters, and it possessed a unique membrane stretched between its fingers and body for flight. Its skeletal structure shows adaptations for aerial locomotion, including a keel-shaped sternum and elongated bones in the wings.</p>
<p>Fossil remains of Rhamphorhynchus provide valuable insights into the evolution of pterosaurs and their ecological roles.</p>
