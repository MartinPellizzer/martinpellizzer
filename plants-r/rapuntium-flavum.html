                    <h1>Rapuntium flavum</h1>
<p>Rapuntium flavum, commonly known as the yellow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>While considered a weed in some agricultural settings, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability.</p>
