                    <h1>Robinsonia masafuerae</h1>
<p>Robinsonia masafuerae, commonly known as the Masafuera rock-moss, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the volcanic soils of the Masafuera Islands in the Gal√°pagos Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with small, succulent leaves that are adapted to the arid and nutrient-poor conditions of its habitat. The plant produces tiny, pale green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and vulnerability to environmental changes, Robinsonia masafuerae is considered critically endangered.</p>
