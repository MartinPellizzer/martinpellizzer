<p>Rubus orthacanthus subsp.</p>
<p>oreades, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often too tart for widespread consumption. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
