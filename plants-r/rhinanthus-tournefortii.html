                    <h1>Rhinanthus tournefortii</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus tournefortii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic nature, though it does not entirely depend on its host for survival. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often in areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its presence can enhance biodiversity by promoting the growth of other plant species in its environment.</p>
