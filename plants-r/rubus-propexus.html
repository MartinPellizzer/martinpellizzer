                    <h1>Rubus propexus</h1>
<p>Rubus propexus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 1,000 meters. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible, though they are generally less palatable than those of other Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
