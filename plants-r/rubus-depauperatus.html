<p>Rubus depauperatus, commonly known as the poorflower raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, weak stems and sparse, often unbranched growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are small, red berries that are generally not palatable to humans but may be consumed by wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile growth, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
