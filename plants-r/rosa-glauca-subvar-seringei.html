                    <h1>Rosa glauca subvar. seringei</h1>
<p>Rosa glauca subvar. seringei, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in late spring. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine, waxy layer that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This subspecies thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
