                    <h1>Razoumofskya microcarpa</h1>
<p>Razoumofskya microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf razorweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its adaptations to high-altitude environments include a deep root system and a slow growth rate to conserve resources.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
