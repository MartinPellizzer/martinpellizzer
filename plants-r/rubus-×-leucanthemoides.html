                    <h1>Rubus × leucanthemoides</h1>
<p>Rubus × leucanthemoides, commonly known as the evergreen bramble or white-leaf bramble, is a hybrid shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces edible berries, though they are typically tart and less commonly consumed compared to other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and persistent leaves throughout the winter.</p>
