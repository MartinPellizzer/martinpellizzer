                    <h1>Romulea bulbocodium var. bulbocodium</h1>
<p>Romulea bulbocodium var. bulbocodium, commonly known as the bulbous romulea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant's bulbous base serves as a storage organ, enabling it to survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to thrive.</p>
