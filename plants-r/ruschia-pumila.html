                    <h1>Ruschia pumila</h1>
<p>Ruschia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
