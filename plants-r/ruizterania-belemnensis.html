<p>Ruizterania belemnensis, commonly known as the belemnite fern, is a fossil plant that dates back to the Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Marattiopsidales and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a complex venation pattern. The plant is typically found in marine sedimentary rocks, indicating its aquatic or coastal habitat. Its structure suggests it was a large, tropical fern that thrived in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>Ruizterania belemnensis provides important insights into the flora of ancient ecosystems and the evolution of ferns.</p>
