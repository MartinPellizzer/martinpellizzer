                    <h1>Rheum undulatum var. crispatum</h1>
<p>Rheum undulatum var. crispatum, commonly known as the curly rhubarb, is a variant of the rhubarb plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive wavy, curled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched stalks that bear small, clustered yellow flowers in early summer. Its leaves are typically large and heart-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>While the leaves are not edible, the stalks can be cooked and consumed, similar to other rhubarb varieties.</p>
