<p>Romulea affinis, commonly known as the spring bulbous orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its underground corms, which store nutrients for growth. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers during the spring season, typically with six petals arranged in a star-like pattern. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the corm.</p>
<p>Romulea affinis is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
