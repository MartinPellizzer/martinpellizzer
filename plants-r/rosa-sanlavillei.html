<p>Rosa sanlavillei, commonly known as the Sanlaville rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features serrated, dark green leaves and thorny stems typical of many rose species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa sanlavillei is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
