<p>Rhinanthus rumelicus subsp.</p>
<p>simonkaianus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in grasslands and meadows, where it plays a role in promoting plant diversity by reducing the dominance of certain grass species.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of well-managed, biodiverse habitats.</p>
