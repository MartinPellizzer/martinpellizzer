                    <h1>Rattraya anomala</h1>
<p>Rattraya anomala, commonly known as the Malayan white sand orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils found in white sand habitats, which are unique to certain regions. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its growth is slow and it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
