                    <h1>Ranunculus rugegensis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus rugegensis, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals, often arranged in a single row around a central stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Ranunculus rugegensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
