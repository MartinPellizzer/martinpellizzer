                    <h1>Rubus gracilicaulis var. burnatii</h1>
<p>Rubus gracilicaulis var. burnatii, commonly known as the slender-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry genus native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland edges and rocky soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
