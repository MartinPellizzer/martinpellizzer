<p>Rhynchosia totta var. longicalyx, commonly known as the long-stemmed cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a valuable forage and cover crop. Its seeds are edible and can be used in cooking, while the plant also serves as a nitrogen-fixing species in agricultural systems.</p>
<p>The varietal name "longicalyx" refers to its long, slender pods, which are a distinguishing feature of this botanical variant.</p>
