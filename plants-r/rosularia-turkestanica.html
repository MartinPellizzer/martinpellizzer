<p>Rosularia turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkistan rosebush, is a perennial succulent native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
