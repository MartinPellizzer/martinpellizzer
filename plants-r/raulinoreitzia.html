<p>Raulinoreitzia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Raulinoreitzia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
