<p>Rubus arrhenii microgene arrhenianthus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves that are adapted to cold, arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
