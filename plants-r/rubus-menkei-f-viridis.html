<p>Rubus menkei f. viridis, commonly known as the green-fruited raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>

The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit is a aggregate of small drupes, which are usually green in color, hence the common name. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in culinary applications due to the tartness of its fruit.</p>
