                    <h1>Ruehssia nana</h1>
<p>Ruehssia nana, commonly known as dwarf ruehssia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its low growth habit and ornamental foliage, it is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens.</p>
