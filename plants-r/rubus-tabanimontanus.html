<p>Rubus tabanimontanus, commonly known as the Tabanimonth raspberry.</p>
<p>It is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its prickly stems, compound leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a reddish color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied member of the Rubus genus.</p>
