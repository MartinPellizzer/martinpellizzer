                    <h1>Rhododendron adenosum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron adenosum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas and eastern China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to white flowers in the spring, which are often fragrant. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blossoms.</p>
<p>Rhododendron adenosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
