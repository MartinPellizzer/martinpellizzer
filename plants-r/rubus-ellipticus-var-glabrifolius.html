                    <h1>Rubus ellipticus var. glabrifolius</h1>
<p>Rubus ellipticus var. glabrifolius, commonly known as the smoothleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, smooth-textured leaves and thornless stems, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments and is often found in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its simple, alternate leaf arrangement and its role in local ecosystems as a food source for wildlife.</p>
