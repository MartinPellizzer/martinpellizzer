                    <h1>Rhipsalis sansibarica</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis sansibarica, commonly known as the East African mistletoe cactus, is a climbing epiphytic cactus native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in small, white or pale green spines. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis sansibarica is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical forests.</p>
