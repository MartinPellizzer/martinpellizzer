                    <h1>Reynoutria brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Reynoutria brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. It produces small, pale green to white flowers in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in regions outside its native range.</p>
