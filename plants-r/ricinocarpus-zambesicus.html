<p>Ricinocarpus zambesicus, commonly known as the Zambesian mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit produces a hard, woody capsule that contains seeds adapted for dispersal by water.</p>
