                    <h1>Rhynchospora globularis var. pinetorum</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora globularis var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine barrens sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as pine flatwoods and wet pine savannas, where it thrives in acidic, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
