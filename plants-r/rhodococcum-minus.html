                    <h1>Rhodococcum minus</h1>
<p>Rhodococcum minus, commonly known as the small red alga, is a unicellular, photosynthetic organism belonging to the Rhodophyta division.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spherical cells that are typically reddish in color due to the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment that aids in light absorption. This alga thrives in marine and freshwater environments, often found attached to rocks or other substrates. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a food source for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Rhodococcum minus is also studied for its potential in biotechnological applications, such as biofuel production.</p>
