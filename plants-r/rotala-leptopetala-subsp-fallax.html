<p>Rotala leptopetala subsp.</p>
<p>fallax, commonly known as the fallax water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy surface and a distinctive reddish or purple underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in spikes, which are often submerged or just barely above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
