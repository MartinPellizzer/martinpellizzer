                    <h1>Rotheca rupicola</h1>
<p>Rotheca rupicola, commonly known as the rock thyme, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for rocky and sandy soils. It is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Rotheca rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
