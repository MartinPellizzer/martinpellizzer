<p>Rhynchanthera limosa, commonly known as the swamp orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Rhynchanthera limosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
