<p>Rhabdocrinum graecum, commonly known as the Greek clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen herb with a rosette of needle-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. Rhabdocrinum graecum thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
