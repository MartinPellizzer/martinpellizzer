                    <h1>Rumex × franktonis</h1>
<p>Rumex × franktonis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (yellow sorrel).</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the veins, which is a characteristic inherited from its parent species. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Rumex × franktonis exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
