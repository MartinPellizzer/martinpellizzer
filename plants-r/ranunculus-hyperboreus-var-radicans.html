                    <h1>Ranunculus hyperboreus var. radicans</h1>
<p>Ranunculus hyperboreus var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping water buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomatous roots that allow it to colonize moist, rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, nutrient-poor environments and is an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
