<p>Rubus × indutiformis, commonly known as the brambleberry or a hybrid raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus idaeus (red raspberry) and Rubus strumosus (blackberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, oval drupelets that are typically reddish or black when mature. Its foliage is compound, with serrated leaflets and a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Rubus × indutiformis is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in temperate climates, making it a common sight in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
