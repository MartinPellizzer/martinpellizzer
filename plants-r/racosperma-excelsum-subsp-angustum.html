<p>Racosperma excelsum subsp.</p>
<p>angustum, commonly known as narrow-leaf wattle, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. It is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, typical of many wattles. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that enables it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies angustum is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other subspecies of Racosperma excelsum.</p>
