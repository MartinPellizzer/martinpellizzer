<p>Rosa glauca var. delasoiei, commonly known as the Delasoie's blue rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pale blue to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are covered in thorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and horticultural rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections.</p>
