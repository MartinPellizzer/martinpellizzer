                    <h1>Rosa caryophyllacea subvar. flavescens</h1>
<p>Rosa caryophyllacea subvar. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sand rose, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in dense, white to yellowish-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range from pale yellow to orange-red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture adapted to withstand drought.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry, sandy soils.</p>
