<p>Raphiocarpus tamdaoensis, commonly known as the Tamdao orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, featuring pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to its rocky or forest floor habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Raphiocarpus tamdaoensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
