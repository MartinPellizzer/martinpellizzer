<p>Richella biglandulosa, commonly known as the two-lobed milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves with a distinctive two-lobed shape. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Richella biglandulosa plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for monarch butterflies.</p>
