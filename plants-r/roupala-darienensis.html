<p>Roupala darienensis, commonly known as the Darien roupala, is a rare shrub native to the Darien region of Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests and is adapted to the high humidity and nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roupala darienensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
