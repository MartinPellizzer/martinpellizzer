                    <h1>Racosperma formidabile</h1>
<p>Racosperma formidabile, commonly known as the giant sandalwood, is a large, woody shrub or small tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
