<p>Rubia cordifolia var. membranacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Rubia cordifolia.</p>
