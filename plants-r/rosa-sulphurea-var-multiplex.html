<p>Rosa sulphurea var. multiplex, commonly known as the golden sand rose, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often tinged with orange or red hues. The plant has woody stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
