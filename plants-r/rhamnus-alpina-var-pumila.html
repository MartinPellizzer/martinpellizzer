<p>Rhamnus alpina var. pumila, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas.</p>
