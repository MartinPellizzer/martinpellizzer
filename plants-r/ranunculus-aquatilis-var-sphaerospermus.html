                    <h1>Ranunculus aquatilis var. sphaerospermus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus aquatilis var. sphaerospermus, commonly known as the spherical-seeded water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it produces small, spherical seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its unique seed morphology and its adaptation to aquatic environments.</p>
