                    <h1>Rhamnus petiolaris</h1>
<p>Rhamnus petiolaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in ecological restoration projects.</p>
