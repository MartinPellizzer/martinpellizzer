                    <h1>Rosa canina f. psilophylla</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. psilophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dogrose, is a botanical variant of the common dogrose, characterized by its slender, elongated leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits reduced leaf size and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Rosa canina. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and produce rose hips that are smaller than those of the standard species.</p>
<p>This form is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
