The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, white to grayish down, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates.</p>
