                            <h1>Rhododendron Luteum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron luteum, also known as the yellow rhododendron, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is prized for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to forested landscapes. This evergreen shrub can grow up to six feet tall and is often found in moist, acidic soils. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a lush backdrop for its showy blooms. Despite its beauty, it requires careful cultivation due to its specific environmental needs.</p>
