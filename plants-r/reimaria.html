                    <h1>Reimaria</h1>
<p>Reimaria, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions of Australia and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves and flowers. The trees can grow quite tall, reaching up to 30 meters in height, with a straight trunk and a dense crown. Reimaria species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and crafting.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, many species are now considered threatened or endangered.</p>
