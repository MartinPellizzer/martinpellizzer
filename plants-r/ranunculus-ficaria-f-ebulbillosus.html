                    <h1>Ranunculus ficaria f. ebulbillosus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus ficaria f. ebulbillosus, commonly known as the bulbous buttercup, is a variant of the European buttercup characterized by its distinctive bulbous tubers.</p>
<p>This plant is native to Central and Eastern Europe and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It features bright yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by two sepals that resemble additional petals. The unique bulbous structure of its rhizomes allows it to store nutrients and survive in less favorable conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
