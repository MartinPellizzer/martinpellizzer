<p>Ranunculus daucifolius, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Ranunculus daucifolius is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a valuable plant for pollinators.</p>
