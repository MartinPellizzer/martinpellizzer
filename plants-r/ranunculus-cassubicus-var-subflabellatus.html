                    <h1>Ranunculus cassubicus var. subflabellatus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus cassubicus var. subflabellatus, commonly known as the subflabellate buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are typically lobed and covered in a fine layer of soft, silky hair. The flowers are showy, with five to seven petal-like sepals that are usually bright yellow or orange in color. It blooms from late spring to early summer, often in moist meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly flabellate (fan-like) appearance of the sepals, giving it a unique floral morphology.</p>
