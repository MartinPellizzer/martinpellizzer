<p>Rhynchospora gigantea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on spikelets. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moist environments, it is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
