                    <h1>Rorippa palustris var. hispida</h1>
<p>Rorippa palustris var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid water-cress, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The variety hispida is distinguished by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves, which provide a unique texture compared to the smooth-leaved typical form. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and other aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic life.</p>
