<p>Rhipsalis baccifera subsp.</p>
<p>horrida, commonly known as the rough rhipsalis, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that often hang in cascading clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it lacks true leaves, relying on its stems for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests.</p>
