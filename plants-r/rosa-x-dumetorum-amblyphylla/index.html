                            <h1>Rosa × Dumetorum Amblyphylla</h1>
<p>Common meadow rose, scientifically known as Rosa × dumetorum amblyphylla, is a hybrid shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. This plant is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The Common meadow rose is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its adaptability and hardiness make it a popular choice for both gardeners and ecological restoration projects.</p>
