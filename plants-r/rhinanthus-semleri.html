                    <h1>Rhinanthus semleri</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus semleri, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows in grasslands and heathlands across Europe.</p>
<p>It has yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant lacks chlorophyll in its stems, relying on its roots to parasitize nearby grasses for nutrients. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in open habitats.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus semleri plays a role in promoting biodiversity by reducing dominant grasses and creating space for other plant species.</p>
