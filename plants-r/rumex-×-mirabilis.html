                    <h1>Rumex × mirabilis</h1>
<p>Rumex × mirabilis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broadleaf sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple tint on the veins, and the plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Rumex × mirabilis exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
