<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in grasslands and meadows, where it helps to reduce the dominance of grasses by weakening them.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of biodiverse and healthy ecosystems.</p>
