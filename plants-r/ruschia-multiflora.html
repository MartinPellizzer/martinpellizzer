                    <h1>Ruschia multiflora</h1>
<p>Ruschia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from both its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>
