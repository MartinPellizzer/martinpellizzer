                    <h1>Ruschia framesii</h1>
<p>Ruschia framesii, commonly known as the silverleaf Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
