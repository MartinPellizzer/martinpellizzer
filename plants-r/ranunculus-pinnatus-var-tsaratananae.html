<p>Ranunculus pinnatus var. tsaratananae, commonly known as the Tsaratanana buttercup, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped structure and finely divided, pinnate leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. The species is notable for its unique floral morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
