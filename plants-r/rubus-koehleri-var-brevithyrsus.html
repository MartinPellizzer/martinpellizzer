                    <h1>Rubus koehleri var. brevithyrsus</h1>
<p>Rubus koehleri var. brevithyrsus, commonly known as the short-thyrsus raspberry, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they are not widely cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus genus.</p>
