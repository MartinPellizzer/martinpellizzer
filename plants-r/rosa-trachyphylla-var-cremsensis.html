<p>Rosa trachyphylla var. cremsensis, commonly known as the Cremsener Rosa, is a rare and compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, thorny stems and small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
