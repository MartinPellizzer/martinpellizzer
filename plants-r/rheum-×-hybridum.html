                    <h1>Rheum × hybridum</h1>
<p>Rheum × hybridum, commonly known as the ornamental rhubarb, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rheum palmatum and Rheum rhaponticum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 60 cm in length, often with a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces tall, reddish stems with clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Rheum × hybridum is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its edible rhubarb stalks.</p>
