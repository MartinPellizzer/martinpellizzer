                    <h1>Russelia lanceifolia</h1>
<p>Russelia lanceifolia, commonly known as the red-hot cat's tail, is a striking tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, red bracts that resemble a cat's tail, which are actually modified leaves, not flowers. The plant produces small, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Russelia lanceifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and vibrant, eye-catching appearance.</p>
