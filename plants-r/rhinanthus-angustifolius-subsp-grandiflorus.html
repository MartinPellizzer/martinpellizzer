                    <h1>Rhinanthus angustifolius subsp. grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus angustifolius subsp.</p>
<p>grandiflorus, commonly known as the greater yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in grasslands and meadows, often in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, with showy, spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of conservation interest due to its specific habitat requirements and declining populations in some regions.</p>
