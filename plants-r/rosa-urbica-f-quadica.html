                    <h1>Rosa urbica f. quadica</h1>
<p>Rosa urbica f. quadica, commonly known as the four-leaf rose, is a rare and ornamental variant of the common dog rose.</p>
<p>This botanical curiosity exhibits a unique floral structure with four petals instead of the typical five, making it a subject of interest in horticulture and botany. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in spring, followed by red-orange hips that are edible but tart.</p>
<p>Its genetic anomaly is believed to result from a mutation affecting the development of floral parts.</p>
