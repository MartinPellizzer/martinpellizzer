                    <h1>Rubus fictus var. pilocarpus</h1>
<p>Rubus fictus var. pilocarpus, commonly known as the pilocarpus raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its unique foliage and fruiting habits.</p>
<p>It typically grows in temperate regions, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. The leaves are usually serrated with a slightly hairy texture, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in the axils of the leaves. The fruit, which is a aggregate berry, is generally smaller than standard raspberries and has a tart flavor.</p>
<p>This variant is less commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic distinctiveness.</p>
