<p>Renealmia coelobractea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique bromeliad native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pale green leaves and striking, showy flowers that resemble a ghostly figure. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead has a rosette of modified leaves that form a water-holding structure. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in clusters, often with a faintly fragrant scent.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or in dense vegetation.</p>
