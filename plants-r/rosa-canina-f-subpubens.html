                    <h1>Rosa canina f. subpubens</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. subpubens, commonly known as the hairy rose dogwood, is a botanical variant of the common dogwood.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence on the stems and leaves, which distinguishes it from the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is native to Europe and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to wildlife.</p>
