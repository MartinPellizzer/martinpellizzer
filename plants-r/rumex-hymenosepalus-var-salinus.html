<p>Rumex hymenosepalus var. salinus, commonly known as salt marsh sorrel, is a variant of the sorrel genus native to coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to tolerate saline and wet environments. The plant typically grows in salt marshes and tidal flats, where it thrives in brackish water conditions. Its leaves are often reddish or purple in color due to high concentrations of anthocyanins.</p>
<p>The species produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind and insects.</p>
