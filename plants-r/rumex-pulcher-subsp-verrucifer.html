<p>Rumex pulcher subsp.</p>
<p>verrucifer, commonly known as the warty sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of arrow-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glandular coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
