<p>Rhynchospora roraimae, commonly known as Roraima sedge, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. Rhynchospora roraimae is adapted to grow in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
