                    <h1>Rumicastrum calyptratum</h1>
<p>Rumicastrum calyptratum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its production of small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seeds are enclosed in follicles that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
