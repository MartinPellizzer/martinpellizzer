                    <h1>Ruschia amicorum</h1>
<p>Ruschia amicorum, commonly known as the friendship plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically blue-green, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Ruschia amicorum is well-suited for rock gardens and containers, requiring minimal care and full sun exposure.</p>
