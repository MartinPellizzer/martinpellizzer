<p>Rhynchospora pubera subsp.</p>
<p>parvula, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, three-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller leaves and more compact growth compared to other members of the Rhynchospora genus.</p>
