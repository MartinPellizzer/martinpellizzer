<p>Rhynchospora junciformis var. monocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its single, terminal flower spike, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Rhynchospora.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
