<p>Radlkoferella glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved radlkoferella, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, glabrous leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
