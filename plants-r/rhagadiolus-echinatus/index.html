                            <h1>Rhagadiolus Echinatus</h1>
<p>Common sunflower, scientifically known as Rhagadiolus echinatus, is a vibrant and iconic flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. With its towering stalks and bright yellow petals, it is a symbol of resilience and warmth in harsh environments. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its large, showy flowers attract pollinators like bees and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. Despite its beauty, the common sunflower is also valued for its seeds, which are used in food and bird feed.</p>
