                            <h1>Ranunculus Pedatifidus Var. Affinis</h1>
<p>Common buttercup, scientifically known as Ranunculus pedatifidus var. affinis, is a strikingly beautiful yet toxic member of the Ranunculaceae family. Native to wetlands and marshy areas, this plant is recognized by its bright yellow flowers and deeply lobed leaves. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it contains harmful compounds that can be dangerous to humans and animals. Its presence in aquatic ecosystems highlights its role in both ecological and botanical studies. The common buttercup remains a subject of fascination for botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
