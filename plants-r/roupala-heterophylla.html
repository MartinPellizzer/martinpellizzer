<p>Roupala heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf roupala, is a small evergreen tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which range from ovate to elliptical, depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically glossy and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment.</p>
<p>Roupala heterophylla is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
