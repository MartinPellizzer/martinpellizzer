<p>Rhinanthus minor subsp.</p>
<p>monticola, commonly known as the mountain yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries.</p>
