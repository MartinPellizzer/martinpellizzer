<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is notable for its evergreen nature, which allows it to retain its leaves year-round, making it a unique addition to gardens in mild climates.

<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
