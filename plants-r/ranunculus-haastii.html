<p>Ranunculus haastii, commonly known as the Haast's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow petals and distinctive leaf structure, with deeply lobed leaves that resemble those of other ranunculus species. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is often found in the lowland and montane regions of the South Island. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Ranunculus haastii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
