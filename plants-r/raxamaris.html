                    <h1>Raxamaris</h1>
<p>Raxamaris, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking silver-white petals with a subtle iridescent sheen that reflects light like moonlight. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, waxy coating. It blooms once a year during the late summer, producing delicate, fragrant flowers that attract specific species of nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Raxamaris is considered a conservation concern.</p>
