<p>Ranunculus chalarocarpus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that resemble those of the common buttercup. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
