<p>Ricinocarpos pinifolius, commonly known as the needleleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
