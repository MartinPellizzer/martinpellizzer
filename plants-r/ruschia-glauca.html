                    <h1>Ruschia glauca</h1>
<p>Ruschia glauca, commonly known as the silver leaf Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, Ruschia glauca is widely cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>
