<p>Rosa gallica subsp.</p>
<p>pumila, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to withstand cold and harsh alpine conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
