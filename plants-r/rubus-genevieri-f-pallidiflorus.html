                    <h1>Rubus genevieri f. pallidiflorus</h1>
<p>Rubus genevieri f. pallidiflorus, commonly known as the pale-flowered blackberry, is a botanical variant of the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or pink blooms of other Rubus species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many brambles. Its fruits, like other blackberries, are aggregate berries that develop from multiple ovaria.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in temperate regions, growing in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
