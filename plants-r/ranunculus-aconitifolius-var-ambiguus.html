                    <h1>Ranunculus aconitifolius var. ambiguus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus aconitifolius var. ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous bellflower, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant features palmately divided leaves with a deeply lobed structure, resembling those of the aconite. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its variable morphology, it is sometimes confused with other ranunculus species, hence its common name.</p>
