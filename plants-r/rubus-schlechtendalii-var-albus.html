<p>Rubus schlechtendalii var. albus, commonly known as the white-flowered everlet, is a rare variant of the everlet raspberry.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China. The plant is a shrub with slender, thornless stems and small, trifoliate leaves. Its most distinguishing feature is its white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The fruits are small, aggregate berries that ripen to a deep red, though they are less commonly consumed than other raspberry varieties.</p>
