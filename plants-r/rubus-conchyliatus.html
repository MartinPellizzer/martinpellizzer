                    <h1>Rubus conchyliatus</h1>
<p>Rubus conchyliatus, commonly known as the sea raspberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, red, raspberry-like fruits that are edible and often used in jams and preserves. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in saline and well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Rubus conchyliatus plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
