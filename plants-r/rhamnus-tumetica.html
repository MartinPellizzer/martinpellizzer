                    <h1>Rhamnus tumetica</h1>
<p>Rhamnus tumetica, commonly known as the inflated buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, berry-like fruits that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
