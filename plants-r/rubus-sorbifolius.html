<p>Rubus sorbifolius, commonly known as the sorbleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that resemble those of the sorbus genus, hence its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
