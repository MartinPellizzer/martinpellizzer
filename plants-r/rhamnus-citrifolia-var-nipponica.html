<p>Rhamnus citrifolia var. nipponica, commonly known as Japanese buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common buckthorn but exhibits distinct morphological and ecological characteristics.</p>
