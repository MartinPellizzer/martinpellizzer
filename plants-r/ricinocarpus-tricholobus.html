<p>Ricinocarpus tricholobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed sandalwood, is a member of the family Lauraceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its aromatic leaves and smooth, pale bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
