<p>Rhinanthus grandiflorus subsp.</p>
<p>major, commonly known as the greater yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in grasslands and heathlands, often in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across suitable habitats.</p>
