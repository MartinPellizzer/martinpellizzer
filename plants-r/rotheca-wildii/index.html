                            <h1>Rotheca Wildii</h1>
<p>Rotheca wildii is a rare and fascinating plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is known for its striking violet-blue flowers and unique leaf structure that sets it apart from other members of the verbena family. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils where few other species can survive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rotheca wildii is considered a vulnerable species. Its beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
