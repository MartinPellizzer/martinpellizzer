                    <h1>Rumex × oryzetorum</h1>
<p>Rumex × oryzetorum, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel).</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate environments and has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and wetland areas.</p>
<p>The plant contains oxalic acid, which gives it a sour taste and can be toxic in large quantities.</p>
