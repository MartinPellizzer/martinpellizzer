<p>Rosa alpina var. adjecta, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>

The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Rosa alpina var. adjecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates.</p>
