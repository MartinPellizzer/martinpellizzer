The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited availability.</p>
