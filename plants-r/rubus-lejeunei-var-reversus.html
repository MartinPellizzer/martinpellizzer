The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Its botanical features include thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
