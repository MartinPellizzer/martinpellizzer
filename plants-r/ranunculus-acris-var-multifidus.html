                    <h1>Ranunculus acris var. multifidus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus acris var. multifidus, commonly known as the divided buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
