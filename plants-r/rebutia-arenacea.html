                    <h1>Rebutia arenacea</h1>
<p>Rebutia arenacea, commonly known as the desert rose or sand rose, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features compact, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>Rebutia arenacea is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
