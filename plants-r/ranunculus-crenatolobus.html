<p>Ranunculus crenatolobus, commonly known as the serrated-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features delicate, palmate leaves with finely serrated edges and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers have five to nine sepals that resemble petals, and it produces small, fleshy fruits called achenes.</p>
<p>Ranunculus crenatolobus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil.</p>
