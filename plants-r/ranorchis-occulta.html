                <h1>Ranorchis occulta</h1>
<p>Ranorchis occulta, commonly known as the hidden orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the dense tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often blend seamlessly with the surrounding foliage, making it difficult to spot. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Ranorchis occulta is considered a conservation concern.</p>
