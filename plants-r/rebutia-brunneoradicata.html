                    <h1>Rebutia brunneoradicata</h1>
<p>Rebutia brunneoradicata, commonly known as the brown-rooted prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the growing season, which are followed by edible, red fruits. Its roots are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Rebutia brunneoradicata is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal water once established.</p>
