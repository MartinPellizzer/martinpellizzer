                    <h1>Ramirezella ornata</h1>
<p>Ramirezella ornata, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant has thin, wiry roots that help it cling to tree bark, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
