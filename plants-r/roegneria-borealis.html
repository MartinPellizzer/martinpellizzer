<p>Roegneria borealis, commonly known as the Arctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Roegneria borealis is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its growth is closely tied to the seasonal cycles of its cold climate habitat.</p>
