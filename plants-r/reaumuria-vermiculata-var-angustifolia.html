                    <h1>Reaumuria vermiculata var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Reaumuria vermiculata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its woody stems are often covered in a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
