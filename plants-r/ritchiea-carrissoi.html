                    <h1>Ritchiea carrissoi</h1>
<p>Ritchiea carrissoi, commonly known as the Coffs Harbour cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves that can grow up to two meters in diameter. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ritchiea carrissoi is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
