<p>Roegneria turuchanensis, commonly known as the Turuchan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has slender,丛生 (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Roegneria turuchanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh native environment and is adapted to survive extreme seasonal variations.</p>
