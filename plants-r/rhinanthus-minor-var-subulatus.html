<p>Rhinanthus minor var. subulatus, commonly known as the lesser yellow rocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Its small, subulate (awl-shaped) leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
