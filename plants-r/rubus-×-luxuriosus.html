                    <h1>Rubus × luxuriosus</h1>
<p>Rubus × luxuriosus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus glaucus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically consumed raw or used in jams and desserts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal areas where it forms dense thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its vigorous growth, it is both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
