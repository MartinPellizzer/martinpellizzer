                    <h1>Ranunculus cicutarius</h1>
<p>Ranunculus cicutarius, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions, making it a common indicator species in freshwater ecosystems.</p>
