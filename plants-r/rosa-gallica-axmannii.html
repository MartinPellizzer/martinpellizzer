<p>Rosa gallica axmannii, commonly known as the Axmann's Gallic Rose, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are often covered in soft, white or pale yellow hairs. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
