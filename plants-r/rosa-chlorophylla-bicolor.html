                    <h1>Rosa chlorophylla bicolor</h1>
<p>Rosa chlorophylla bicolor, commonly known as the twin-chlorophyll rose, is a rare and unique species characterized by its unusual chlorophyll distribution.</p>
<p>Its leaves exhibit a striking dichotomy, with one side displaying normal green pigmentation and the other appearing pale or yellow due to reduced chlorophyll content. This phenomenon is believed to result from a genetic mutation affecting chloroplast development. The plant's flowers are typically pink to white, with a subtle fragrance that is less intense than in most roses.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas.</p>
