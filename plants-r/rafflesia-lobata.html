                    <h1>Rafflesia lobata</h1>
<p>Rafflesia lobata, commonly known as the giant lobster orchid, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant's unique structure and life cycle make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
