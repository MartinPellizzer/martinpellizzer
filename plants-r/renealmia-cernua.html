<p>Renealmia cernua, commonly known as the drooping lily or swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that often form dense clumps. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Renealmia cernua is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
