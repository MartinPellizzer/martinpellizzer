                    <h1>Rhetinantha ophiodens</h1>
<p>Rhetinantha ophiodens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in specific, moist, pine rockland habitats and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
