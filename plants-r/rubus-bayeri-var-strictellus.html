                    <h1>Rubus bayeri var. strictellus</h1>
<p>Rubus bayeri var. strictellus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Rubus bayeri. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early summer, followed by red, edible berries that are similar to raspberries. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range.</p>
