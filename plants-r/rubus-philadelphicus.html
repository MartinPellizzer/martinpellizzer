<p>Rubus philadelphicus, commonly known as the Philadelphia raspberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in jams and preserves. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
