                    <h1>Rhynchospora scabrata var. laevifolia</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora scabrata var. laevifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically smooth and lance-shaped, with a grass-like texture, and the plant often grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and swampy areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered at the tips of the stems, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical form of Rhynchospora scabrata by its smoother leaf surfaces and slightly different growth habits.</p>
