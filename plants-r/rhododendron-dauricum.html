<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its dense, broad leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
