                    <h1>Ruschia singula</h1>
<p>Ruschia singula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
