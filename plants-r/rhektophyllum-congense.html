                    <h1>Rhektophyllum congense</h1>
<p>Rhektophyllum congense, commonly known as the Congo rhektophyllum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhektophyllum congense is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall and nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status remains a concern for botanists and conservationists.</p>
