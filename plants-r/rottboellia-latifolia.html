<p>Rottboellia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf rottbollia, is a tropical annual grass species native to Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions where it is not native.</p>
