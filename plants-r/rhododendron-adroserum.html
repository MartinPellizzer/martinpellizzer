<p>Rhododendron adroserum, commonly known as the bog rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and bogs of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture, making it a specialist of bog ecosystems. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, adapted to retain water in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>Rhododendron adroserum plays a role in stabilizing bog soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
