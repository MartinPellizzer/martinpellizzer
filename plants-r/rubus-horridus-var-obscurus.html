                    <h1>Rubus horridus var. obscurus</h1>
<p>Rubus horridus var. obscurus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and dark, edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its berries are used in culinary applications, though the plant's bristly texture makes it challenging to handle.</p>
