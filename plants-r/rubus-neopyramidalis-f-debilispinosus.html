                    <h1>Rubus neopyramidalis f. debilispinosus</h1>
<p>Rubus neopyramidalis f. debilispinosus, commonly known as the weakly spiny form of the pyramidal blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorn-like structures that are less pronounced than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological role.</p>
