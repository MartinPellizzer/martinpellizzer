                    <h1>Rhadinocarpus acutifolius</h1>
<p>Rhadinocarpus acutifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, hard wood and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
