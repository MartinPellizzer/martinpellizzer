<p>Rhipsalis madagascariensis var. dasycerca, commonly known as the hairy rhipsalis, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features long, slender, and often hairy stems that hang in cascading clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by bright red berries. Its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
