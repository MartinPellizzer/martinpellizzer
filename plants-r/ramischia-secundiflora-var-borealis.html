                    <h1>Ramischia secundiflora var. borealis</h1>
<p>Ramischia secundiflora var. borealis, commonly known as the northern ramischia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and hairy, dark green leaves that help insulate it against extreme cold. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom briefly during the short growing season. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
