                    <h1>Rafflesia baletei</h1>
<p>Rafflesia baletei, commonly known as the Bornean corpse flower, is a parasitic plant found in the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is notable for its large, fleshy, and strongly odorous flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a trait that aids in attracting pollinators such as flies and beetles. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, making it one of the largest individual flowers in the world.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia baletei is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native environment.</p>
