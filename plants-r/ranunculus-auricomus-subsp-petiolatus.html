<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>petiolatus, commonly known as the petiolate buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy yellow flowers with 5-10 sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive lobed structure.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its hairy stems and subshrubby growth habit, which help it survive in cooler climates.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated petioles, which are longer than those of the typical R. auricomus.</p>
