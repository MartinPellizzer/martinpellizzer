                    <h1>Ribes sativum f. variegatum</h1>
<p>Ribes sativum f. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated gooseberry, is a cultivar of the gooseberry plant characterized by its striking variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Ribes, which is part of the family Grossulariaceae. The plant is a deciduous shrub that produces small, edible berries, though the variegation in its leaves makes it popular as an ornamental plant. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and partial sunlight.</p>
<p>The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll distribution, resulting in a mix of green, white, and yellow hues on the leaves.</p>
