                    <h1>Rumex densiflorus</h1>
<p>Rumex densiflorus, commonly known as denseflower sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, and it produces clusters of small, greenish flowers in late spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful if consumed in large quantities.</p>
