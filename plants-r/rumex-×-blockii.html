                    <h1>Rumex × blockii</h1>
<p>Rumex × blockii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with reddish veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
