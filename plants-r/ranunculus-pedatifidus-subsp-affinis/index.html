                            <h1>Ranunculus Pedatifidus Subsp. Affinis</h1>
<p>Water buttercup, scientifically known as Ranunculus pedatifidus subsp. affinis, is a striking aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in temperate regions. Its delicate, yellow flowers with deeply divided petals make it a distinctive and easily recognizable species. This plant thrives in shallow waters, often found near ponds, streams, and marshes, where it plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. Its presence is an indicator of clean, unpolluted water, making it both ecologically significant and visually appealing.</p>
