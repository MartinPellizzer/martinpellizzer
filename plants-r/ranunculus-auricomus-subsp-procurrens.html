<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>procurrens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petals.</p>
<p>The plant produces a cluster of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It spreads by rhizomes and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
