                    <h1>Roemeria hybrida var. latiloba</h1>
<p>Roemeria hybrida var. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf roemeria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tip, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
