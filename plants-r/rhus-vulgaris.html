                    <h1>Rhus vulgaris</h1>
<p>Rhus vulgaris, commonly known as sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus vulgaris thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands, open fields, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its toxic properties make it important to handle with care, though it has historical uses in medicine and dye production.</p>
