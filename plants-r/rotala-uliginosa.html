<p>Rotala uliginosa, commonly known as mosquito plant or water thyme, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to wetland environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in aquatic settings. The plant produces small, bright green leaves that are usually submerged, with some leaves floating on the water surface. It blooms with tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it is often used in aquariums and wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Rotala uliginosa is known for its ability to absorb nutrients from the water, making it beneficial for water quality improvement.</p>
