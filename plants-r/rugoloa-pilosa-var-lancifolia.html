<p>Rugoloa pilosa var. lancifolia, commonly known as the hairy rugoloa, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
