                    <h1>Reholttumia novae-caledoniae</h1>
<p>Reholttumia novae-caledoniae, commonly known as the New Caledonia reholttumia, is a rare endemic plant species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants, many of which are shrubs or small trees. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries as fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation.</p>
