<p>Rhodanthemum atlanticum subsp.</p>
<p>gelidum, commonly known as the Atlantic rock rose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of northern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh maritime conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with a maritime climate.</p>
