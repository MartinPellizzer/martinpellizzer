                    <h1>Rhodanthemum atlanticum</h1>
<p>Rhodanthemum atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic rhodanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and coastal bluffs, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment.</p>
<p>Rhodanthemum atlanticum plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
