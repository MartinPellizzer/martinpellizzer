<p>Ruppia maritima f. pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate sea rocket, is a variant of the common sea rocket, a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pectinate (comb-like) leaves, which are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. This subspecies thrives in coastal areas, particularly in intertidal zones and brackish water habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and are pollinated by wind.</p>
