<p>Rhinanthus glaber, commonly known as the naked antelope plant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus glaber is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
