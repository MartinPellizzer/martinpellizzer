                    <h1>Rebutia minuscula</h1>
<p>Rebutia minuscula, commonly known as the miniature rebutia, is a compact cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
