                    <h1>Rhinanthus parviflorus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered yellow-rattle, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that grows in grassland habitats.</p>
<p>It has yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, as it lacks the ability to photosynthesize efficiently. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in open, sunny areas.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus parviflorus plays a role in supporting pollinators and is considered a valuable plant for biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
