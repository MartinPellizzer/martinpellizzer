                    <h1>Rhodocodon monophyllus</h1>
<p>Rhodocodon monophyllus, commonly known as the single-leaf rhodocodon, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its solitary, palmately lobed leaf that emerges from a short, woody stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and ecological role in its native ecosystem.</p>
