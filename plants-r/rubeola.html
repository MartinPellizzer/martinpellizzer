                    <h1>Rubeola</h1>
<p>Rubeola, commonly known as measles, is a viral infection caused by the paramyxovirus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by a high fever, cough, runny nose, and a distinctive red rash that typically starts on the face and spreads downward. The plant aspect of rubeola is not applicable, as it is not a plant but a human pathogen. However, the disease can affect plants in greenhouse environments if the virus is present in the air.</p>
<p>Rubeola is highly contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets.</p>
