<p>Rhipidodendrum dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, dichotomously branching stems that lack true leaves, instead bearing microphylls. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in strobili, which are cone-like structures at the tips of the branches.</p>
<p>Rhipidodendrum dichotomum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
