                    <h1>Rhaponticum pallasii</h1>
<p>Rhaponticum pallasii, commonly known as the Siberian cowplant, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a stout, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with glandular hairs. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a single head at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Rhaponticum pallasii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, alpine environments.</p>
