<p>Raveniopsis abyssicola, commonly known as the abyssinian raveniopsis, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often covered in a fine pubescence, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Raveniopsis abyssicola is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
