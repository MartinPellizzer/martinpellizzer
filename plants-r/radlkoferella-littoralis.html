<p>Radlkoferella littoralis, commonly known as the coastal rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the rocky shores of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to retain moisture in its arid coastal habitat. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its succulent nature allows it to survive in harsh, saline environments.</p>
<p>Radlkoferella littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
