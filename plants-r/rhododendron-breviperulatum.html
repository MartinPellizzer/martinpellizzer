                    <h1>Rhododendron breviperulatum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron breviperulatum, commonly known as the dwarf flame azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
