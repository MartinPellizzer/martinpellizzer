<p>Ridleyandra kiewii subsp.</p>
<p>kiewii, commonly known as the Kiewi Ridgeplant, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically elliptical and covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
