<p>Rhytiglossa leucophloea, commonly known as the white phloem orchid, is a unique species belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white to pale green stems and leaves, which are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
