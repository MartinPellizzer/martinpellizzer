                    <h1>Ranunculus tripartitus var. fluitans</h1>
<p>Ranunculus tripartitus var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a variant of the buttercup species characterized by its unique aquatic adaptation.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in shallow water environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where its leaves float on the water surface. The leaves are broad and lobed, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are bright yellow with numerous petals, blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for various herbivorous animals.</p>
