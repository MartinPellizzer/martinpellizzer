                    <h1>Rhamnus communis</h1>
<p>Rhamnus communis, commonly known as common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 2â€“6 meters and is characterized by its dark green, oval leaves and small, black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is notable for its smooth, grey bark and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued in traditional medicine for its astringent properties.</p>
