<p>Racosperma mimicum, commonly known as the mimic acacia, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its ability to mimic the appearance of other acacia species, a trait that may aid in its survival by deterring herbivores. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and its root system helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Racosperma mimicum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>
