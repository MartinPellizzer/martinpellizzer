<p>Rubus perperus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant is typically shrub-like, with a woody structure that persists through multiple growing seasons. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces fruit in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>The berries are edible, though they are often used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor.</p>
