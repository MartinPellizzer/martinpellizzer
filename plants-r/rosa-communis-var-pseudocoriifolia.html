                    <h1>Rosa communis var. pseudocoriifolia</h1>
<p>Rosa communis var. pseudocoriifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed rose, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the common rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are broader than those of typical Rosa species. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in woodland edges and moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in botanical collections.</p>
