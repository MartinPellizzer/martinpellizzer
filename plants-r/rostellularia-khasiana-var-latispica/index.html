<p>Rostellularia khasiana var. latispica is a rare and unique plant species native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is known for its striking floral display and medicinal properties. This variant is distinguished by its broad, spiny bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
