<p>Rubus × amplifoliatus var. inaequidentatus, commonly known as the unequal-toothed blackberry, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>

The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and more flavorful than those of its parent species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variability.</p>
