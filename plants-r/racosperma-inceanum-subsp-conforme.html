<p>Racosperma inceanum subsp.</p>
<p>conforme, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its yellow floral spikes and pinnate leaves, which are typical features of the legume family.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience to salt spray and wind, it is sometimes used in coastal revegetation projects.</p>
