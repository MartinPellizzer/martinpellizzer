                    <h1>Rubus idaeus f. strobilaceus</h1>
<p>Rubus idaeus f. strobilaceus, commonly known as the everbearing raspberry, is a horticultural form of the red raspberry plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce fruit multiple times throughout the growing season, unlike the typical summer-bearing raspberries. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are white and clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by the characteristic red, edible berries.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in gardens and commercial cultivation for its extended harvest period and flavorful fruits.</p>
