<p>Royena acocksii, commonly known as the Acocks' rock fig, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
