                    <h1>Rumex decumbens</h1>
<p>Rumex decumbens, commonly known as creeping sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features succulent, oval leaves that are often reddish or purplish at the base, with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable ground cover in certain ecosystems.</p>
