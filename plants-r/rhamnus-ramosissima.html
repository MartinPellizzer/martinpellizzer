                    <h1>Rhamnus ramosissima</h1>
<p>Rhamnus ramosissima, commonly known as the creosote bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various animals.</p>
<p>The creosote bush is also known for its strong, aromatic resin, which contributes to its common name.</p>
