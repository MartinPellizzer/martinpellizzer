<p>Rhyncholacis flagellifolia, commonly known as the flagellate lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungal component and a green algal partner.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhyncholacidae and is characterized by its distinct, branched thallus structure. The plant forms a dense, crust-like growth on rock surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its morphology includes elongated, whip-like branches that give it its common name.</p>
<p>Rhyncholacis flagellifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
