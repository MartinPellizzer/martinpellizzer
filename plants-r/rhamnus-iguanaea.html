                    <h1>Rhamnus iguanaea</h1>
<p>Rhamnus iguanaea, commonly known as the iguana bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, smooth, orange fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
