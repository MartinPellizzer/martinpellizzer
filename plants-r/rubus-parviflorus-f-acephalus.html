                    <h1>Rubus parviflorus f. acephalus</h1>
<p>Rubus parviflorus f. acephalus, commonly known as the smooth-leaf raspberry, is a variant of the common raspberry species characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually reddish or yellowish in color, which are edible but less commonly cultivated than other raspberry varieties. Its botanical features include trifoliate leaves and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by the absence of the typical hairy covering found on the leaves of the standard species.</p>
