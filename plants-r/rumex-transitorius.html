<p>Rumex transitorius, commonly known as common sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves are edible and have a tart, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content.</p>
