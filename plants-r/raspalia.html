                    <h1>Raspalia</h1>
<p>Raspalia, commonly known as the "flower of the moon," is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking, bioluminescent petals that glow softly under moonlight, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a complex root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Raspalia blooms only once every seven years, making it a highly sought-after specimen in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Its scientific classification remains a subject of ongoing research due to its unusual genetic makeup.</p>
