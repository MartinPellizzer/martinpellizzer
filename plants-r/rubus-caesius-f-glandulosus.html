                    <h1>Rubus caesius f. glandulosus</h1>
<p>Rubus caesius f. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular raspberry, is a botanical variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on the stems and leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is known for its prickly stems and edible, red, raspberry-like fruits. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The glandular hairs on its surface give it a unique texture and may play a role in its ecological interactions.</p>
