                    <h1>Rafflesia banaoana</h1>
<p>Rafflesia banaoana, commonly known as the Banao Rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing one of the largest flowers in the world, with blooms reaching up to 30 inches in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Rafflesia banaoana is considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
