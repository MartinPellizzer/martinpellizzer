<p>Ranunculus eremogenes, commonly known as the desert buttercup, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that helps reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which further aid in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Ranunculus eremogenes plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores.</p>
