<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>sidereus, commonly known as the silverleaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, which gives it its common name.</p>

<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered vulnerable in its native habitat.</p>
