                    <h1>Rubus horridus var. rosaceus</h1>
<p>Rubus horridus var. rosaceus, commonly known as the brambles rose or prickly rose, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries, though they are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its aggressive growth habit.</p>
