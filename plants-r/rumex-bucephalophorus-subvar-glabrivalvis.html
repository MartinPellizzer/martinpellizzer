                    <h1>Rumex bucephalophorus subvar. glabrivalvis</h1>
<p>Rumex bucephalophorus subvar. glabrivalvis, commonly known as the smooth-valved dock, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth on the margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This subvariety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaf valves, a key feature in its taxonomic classification.</p>
