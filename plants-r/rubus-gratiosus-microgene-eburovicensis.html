                    <h1>Rubus gratiosus microgene eburovicensis</h1>
<p>Rubus gratiosus microgene eburovicensis, commonly known as the Eburovician rose, is a rare species of bramble native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
