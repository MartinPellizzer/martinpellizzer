                    <h1>Rhus fulva</h1>
<p>Rhus fulva, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age, and its compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Rhus fulva thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and ornamental features make it a common sight in many parts of its native range.</p>
