                    <h1>Rubus glaucophyllus</h1>
<p>Rubus glaucophyllus, commonly known as the blue-leafed raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a reddish color. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native range.</p>
