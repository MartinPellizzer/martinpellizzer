                            <h1>Ranunculus Flabellatus Var. Fibrosus</h1>
<p>Fibrous buttercup, scientifically known as Ranunculus flabellatus var. fibrosus, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. This delicate yet resilient plant is native to regions of North America, particularly the western United States. Its most distinctive feature is its intricate, lacy foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often found in both natural habitats and cultivated gardens.</p>
