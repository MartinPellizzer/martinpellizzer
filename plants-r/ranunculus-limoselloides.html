                    <h1>Ranunculus limoselloides</h1>
<p>Ranunculus limoselloides, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. It thrives in nutrient-rich, wet soils and is often found in bogs, stream sides, and other moist habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
