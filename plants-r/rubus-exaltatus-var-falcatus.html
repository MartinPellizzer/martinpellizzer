                    <h1>Rubus exaltatus var. falcatus</h1>
<p>Rubus exaltatus var. falcatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Rubus exaltatus. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are usually smaller and more acidic than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for its unique flavor and ornamental value.</p>
