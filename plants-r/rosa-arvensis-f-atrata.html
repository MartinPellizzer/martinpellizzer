                    <h1>Rosa arvensis f. atrata</h1>
<p>Rosa arvensis f. atrata, commonly known as the black rose, is a variant of the field rose that exhibits distinctive dark pigmentation.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by its deep purple to almost black flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant is a perennial shrub that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features include thorny stems, pinnate leaves, and fragrant flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The dark coloration of its petals is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, giving it a unique ornamental appeal.</p>
