                    <h1>Remijia berryi</h1>
<p>Remijia berryi, commonly known as the Sierra Madre nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them a cautionary example in botanical studies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Remijia berryi plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for specific wildlife species despite its toxic properties.</p>
