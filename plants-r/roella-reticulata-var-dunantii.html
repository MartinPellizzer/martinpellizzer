                    <h1>Roella reticulata var. dunantii</h1>
<p>Roella reticulata var. dunantii, commonly known as the Dunantii nettle, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Urticaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves contain stinging hairs, a common trait among members of the nettle family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
