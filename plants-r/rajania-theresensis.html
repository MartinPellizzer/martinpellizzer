<p>Rajania theresensis, commonly known as the Red-veined Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red veins contrasting against its pale green or white petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Rajania theresensis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
