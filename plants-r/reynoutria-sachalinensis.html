                    <h1>Reynoutria sachalinensis</h1>
<p>Reynoutria sachalinensis, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring heart-shaped leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and become invasive in non-native regions. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in urban environments.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a significant ecological and economic problem in many areas.</p>
