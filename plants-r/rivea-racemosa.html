                    <h1>Rivea racemosa</h1>
<p>Rivea racemosa, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its roots are not typically edible, unlike the sweet potato, but the plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal in hanging baskets and containers.</p>
<p>Rivea racemosa thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
