                    <h1>Rosa canina f. labilipoda</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. labilipoda, commonly known as the variable rosehip.</p>
<p>This botanical variant is a subspecies of the dog rose, characterized by its distinctive floral and fruit morphology. It typically features smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The fruits, or rosehips, are often more elongated and less robust.</p>
<p>This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological variability and potential adaptations to specific environmental conditions.</p>
