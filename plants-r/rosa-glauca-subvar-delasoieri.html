                    <h1>Rosa glauca subvar. delasoieri</h1>
<p>Rosa glauca subvar. delasoieri, commonly known as the Delasoi rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subvariety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its resilience to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
