                    <h1>Rumex × hagensis</h1>
<p>Rumex × hagensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa-marinera (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical characteristics. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish coloration, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
