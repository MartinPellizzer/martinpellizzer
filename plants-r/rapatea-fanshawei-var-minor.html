<p>Rapatea fanshawei var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf fan-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with finely divided, fan-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its small stature and intricate leaf structure make it a sought-after species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
