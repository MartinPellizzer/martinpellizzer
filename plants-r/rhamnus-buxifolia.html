                    <h1>Rhamnus buxifolia</h1>
<p>Rhamnus buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in natural habitats.</p>
