<p>Roegneria festucoides, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to grazing.</p>
<p>Roegneria festucoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
