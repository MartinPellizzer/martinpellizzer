                    <h1>Rheum tibeticum</h1>
<p>Rheum tibeticum, commonly known as Tibetan rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall, reddish stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early summer. Its rhubarb-like roots are used in traditional medicine for their laxative properties.</p>
<p>However, the plant is toxic if consumed in large quantities, making it important to handle with care.</p>
