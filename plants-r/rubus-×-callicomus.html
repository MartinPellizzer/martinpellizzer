                    <h1>Rubus × callicomus</h1>
<p>Rubus × callicomus, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the common blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the raspberry).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, offering a tart and sweet flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a popular choice for commercial and home gardening.</p>
