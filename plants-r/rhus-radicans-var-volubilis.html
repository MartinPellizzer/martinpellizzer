                    <h1>Rhus radicans var. volubilis</h1>
<p>Rhus radicans var. volubilis, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into elongated, pointed leaflets that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides.</p>
<p>The plant has a shallow, spreading root system that makes it somewhat invasive in certain regions.</p>
