<p>Rhododendron atlanticum f. neglectum, commonly known as the coastal rhododendron, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
