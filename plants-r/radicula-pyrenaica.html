<p>Radicula pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean radicle, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound umbels and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky and limestone-rich soils at high altitudes. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, and it is often found in moist, shaded microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Radicula pyrenaica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
