                    <h1>Rosa canina var. hispida</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. hispida, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a thorny shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a rough, bristly texture. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring, followed by orange to red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins, and the stems are often covered in sharp prickles.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
