                    <h1>Rhamnus × hybrida</h1>
<p>Rhamnus × hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Rhamnus cathartica and Rhamnus alnifolia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 3–6 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Rhamnus × hybrida is native to Europe and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and ornamental qualities make it a popular choice in landscaping, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
