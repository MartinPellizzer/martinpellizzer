                    <h1>Rosa gnaphalodes</h1>
<p>Rosa gnaphalodes, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, providing a unique visual appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hirsute texture is due to the presence of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Rosa gnaphalodes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
