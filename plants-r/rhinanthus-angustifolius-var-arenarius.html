<p>Rhinanthus angustifolius var. arenarius, commonly known as the sand everlasting or sand rhinoceros flower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
