                    <h1>Rottboellia exaltata f. arundinacea</h1>
<p>Rottboellia exaltata f. arundinacea, commonly known as the bamboo grass or giant bamboo grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, clumping growth habit.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can dominate disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes or used in erosion control due to its hardy nature and rapid growth.</p>
