<p>Rhamnus cathartica var. sylvatica, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant is notable for its dark, purplish-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it often grows in woodland edges or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in dye production.</p>
