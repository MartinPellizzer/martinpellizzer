                    <h1>Racosperma caveale</h1>
<p>Racosperma caveale, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are typical of the Hakea genus. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Racosperma caveale is well adapted to fire-prone ecosystems and can resprout from its lignified stems after bushfires.</p>
