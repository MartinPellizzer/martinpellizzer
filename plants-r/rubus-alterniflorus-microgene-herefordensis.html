<p>Rubus alterniflorus microgene herefordensis, commonly known as the Hereford raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which help in identifying it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they are not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are alternate, with serrated edges and a distinctive pubescent surface.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
