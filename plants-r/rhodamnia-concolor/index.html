                            <h1>Rhodamnia Concolor</h1>
<p>Common bottle tree, scientifically known as Rhodamnia concolor, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family native to Australia. This unique plant is named for its swollen, bottle-like trunk that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its foliage consists of alternate, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest. While it produces small, inconspicuous flowers, the plant is primarily valued for its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping and adds a dramatic focal point to desert gardens.</p>
