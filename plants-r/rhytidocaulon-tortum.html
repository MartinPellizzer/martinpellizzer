                    <h1>Rhytidocaulon tortum</h1>
<p>Rhytidocaulon tortum, commonly known as the twisted root orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, twisted roots that give it its common name and help it anchor to tree bark in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a raceme, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, usually found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
