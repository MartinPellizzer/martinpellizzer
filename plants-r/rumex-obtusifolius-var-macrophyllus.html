                    <h1>Rumex obtusifolius var. macrophyllus</h1>
<p>Rumex obtusifolius var. macrophyllus, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its leaves are edible but can be quite tart, and the plant has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
