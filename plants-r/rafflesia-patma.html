                    <h1>Rafflesia patma</h1>
<p>Rafflesia patma, commonly known as the giant Rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying flesh to attract pollinators like flies and beetles.</p>
<p>The plant's unique structure and reproductive strategy make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
