                    <h1>Rochelia disperma var. disperma</h1>
<p>Rochelia disperma var. disperma, commonly known as the common rockweed, is a marine brown alga that thrives in intertidal zones along rocky shores.</p>
<p>It has a filamentous thallus with a dark brown coloration and is typically found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. The plant exhibits a branching structure that allows it to anchor itself to substrates using holdfasts. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including both sexual and asexual spores, contribute to its widespread distribution along coastal regions.</p>
