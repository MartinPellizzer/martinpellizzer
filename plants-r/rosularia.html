                    <h1>Rosularia</h1>
<p>Rosularia, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their fleshy, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette formation. Rosularia species are native to temperate and arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They typically produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, many species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
