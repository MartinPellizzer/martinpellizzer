<p>Rosa glauca subvar. discreta, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, silvery-white fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a soft, downy texture.</p>
<p>This subvariety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
