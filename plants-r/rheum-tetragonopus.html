                    <h1>Rheum tetragonopus</h1>
<p>Rheum tetragonopus, commonly known as palmate rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that resemble a palm, hence its common name. The plant produces tall, reddish stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers in the spring. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible, though they are typically used in traditional medicine rather than culinary applications.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unique foliage and medicinal properties.</p>
