                    <h1>Rubus emersidens</h1>
<p>Rubus emersidens, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a species of brambles native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they are often bitter and less palatable than other Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Rubus emersidens plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
