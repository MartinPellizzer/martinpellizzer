<p>Rosa uniflorella, commonly known as the single-flower rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, solitary flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa uniflorella is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
