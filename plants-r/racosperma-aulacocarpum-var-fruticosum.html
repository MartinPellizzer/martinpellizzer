                    <h1>Racosperma aulacocarpum var. fruticosum</h1>
<p>Racosperma aulacocarpum var. fruticosum, commonly known as the sturt's desert peaberry, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hard, angular pods. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that releases seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal in the harsh environment.</p>
