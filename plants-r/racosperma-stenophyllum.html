                    <h1>Racosperma stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Racosperma stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a dense, feathery pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, spherical clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a similar climate.</p>
