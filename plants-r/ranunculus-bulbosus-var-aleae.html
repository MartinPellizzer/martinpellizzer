                    <h1>Ranunculus bulbosus var. aleae</h1>
<p>Ranunculus bulbosus var. aleae, commonly known as the Aleutian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska.</p>
<p>It features palmate, finely divided leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, coastal climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
