<p>Rhus scandens, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright red, fuzzy fruits that appear in late summer and persist through winter. Its bark is thick and rugged, with a distinctive, scaly texture that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Staghorn sumac is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
