                    <h1>Rhynchosia dielsii</h1>
<p>Rhynchosia dielsii, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein. Rhynchosia dielsii thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings.</p>
