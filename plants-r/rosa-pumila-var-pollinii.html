                    <h1>Rosa pumila var. pollinii</h1>
<p>Rosa pumila var. pollinii, commonly known as the Tibetan rose or snow rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features dense, thorny stems that form compact, mat-like growths, often reaching heights of only a few centimeters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in odd-pinnate patterns, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms.</p>
<p>This hardy species is well adapted to cold, arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings.</p>
