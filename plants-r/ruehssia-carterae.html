<p>Ruehssia carterae, commonly known as the Carter's ruehssia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces small, clustered blossoms in shades of white and pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ruehssia carterae is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study.</p>
