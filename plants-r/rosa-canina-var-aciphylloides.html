                    <h1>Rosa canina var. aciphylloides</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. aciphylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose characterized by its slender, elongated leaves.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia, typically growing in woodland and scrub habitats. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in spring, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Its foliage is often more densely packed and narrower than that of the typical Rosa canina.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
