                    <h1>Roupala elegans</h1>
<p>Roupala elegans, commonly known as the elegant roupala, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are glossy on the upper surface and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental planting in warm climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
