                            <h1>Rosa × Dumetorum Var. Amblyphylla</h1>
<p>Common meadow rose, scientifically known as Rosa × dumetorum var. amblyphylla, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant pink or red blooms and its ability to thrive in open meadows and grasslands. This variety of rose is often mistaken for other wild roses due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and unique floral structure. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local pollinators. Despite its beauty, it is also considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habits.</p>
