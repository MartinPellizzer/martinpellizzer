                    <h1>Rhinanthus vachellae</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus vachellae, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in grasslands and open habitats, where it helps to reduce the dominance of dominant grass species.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of biodiverse and healthy ecosystems.</p>
