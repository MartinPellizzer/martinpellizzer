<p>Rubus × pseudosubertii, commonly known as the blackberry-elderberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a mix of traits from both blackberries and elderberries, making it a unique and sometimes invasive species in its native range.</p>
