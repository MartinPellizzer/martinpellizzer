                    <h1>Ribes apiifolium</h1>
<p>Ribes apiifolium, commonly known as the American gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, resembling the leaves of the carrot plant, hence its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. These berries are often used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor.</p>
<p>Ribes apiifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
