                    <h1>Ruschia indurata</h1>
<p>Ruschia indurata, commonly known as the hard-leaved Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fleshy, and often blue-green colored leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in arid regions.</p>
