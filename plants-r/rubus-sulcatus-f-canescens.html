                    <h1>Rubus sulcatus f. canescens</h1>
<p>Rubus sulcatus f. canescens, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and stems.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more robust growth habit compared to the typical Rubus sulcatus, with a dense covering of fine, white hairs across its surface. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
