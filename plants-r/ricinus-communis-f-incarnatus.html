<p>Ricinus communis f. incarnatus, commonly known as the crimson cup or bloodleaf, is a unique variant of the castor oil plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety, crimson-red foliage that contrasts sharply with its typical green leaves. The plant is a shrub or small tree, native to tropical regions, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>While it does not produce the typical castor oil seeds, it is valued for its vibrant color and is often cultivated in gardens for aesthetic purposes.</p>
