<p>Rubus vulnerificus, commonly known as the poison ivy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a red, hairy drupe that ripens in the fall.</p>
<p>However, it is considered toxic due to the presence of urushiol, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans.</p>
