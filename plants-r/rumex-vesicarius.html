                    <h1>Rumex vesicarius</h1>
<p>Rumex vesicarius, commonly known as bladder campion, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on terminal panicles. Its distinctive feature is the presence of inflated, bladder-like structures at the base of the leaves, which are filled with air and help in buoyancy.</p>
<p>Rumex vesicarius is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
