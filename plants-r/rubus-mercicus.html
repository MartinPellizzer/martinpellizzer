                    <h1>Rubus mercicus</h1>
<p>Rubus mercicus, commonly known as the European blackberry shrub, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals.</p>
<p>The berries are edible, though they are often used in jams and pies rather than eaten raw due to their tart flavor.</p>
