                    <h1>Romanzoffia minima</h1>
<p>Romanzoffia minima, commonly known as the small water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing organs called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Romanzoffia minima is often used in ornamental ponds and as a water filtration plant due to its ability to absorb excess nutrients.</p>
