<p>Rubus clethraphilus var. ferox, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit, while edible, is generally less palatable than other raspberry varieties and is often used in local traditional cuisines.</p>
