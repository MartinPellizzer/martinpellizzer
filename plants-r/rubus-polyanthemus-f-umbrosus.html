                    <h1>Rubus polyanthemus f. umbrosus</h1>
<p>Rubus polyanthemus f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shade raspberry, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring. The plant bears red, hairy fruits that are typically smaller and less flavorful than those of the common raspberry. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural areas.</p>
