                    <h1>Rubus emendatus</h1>
<p>Rubus emendatus, commonly known as the emended blackberry, is a species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of eastern Asia, including China and Korea, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and have a tart flavor. Botanically, it features compound leaves with serrated edges and a robust root system that aids in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Its morphology closely resembles other Rubus species, making it challenging to distinguish without detailed taxonomic analysis.</p>
