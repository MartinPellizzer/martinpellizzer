                    <h1>Rosa pendulina var. intercalaris</h1>
<p>Rosa pendulina var. intercalaris, commonly known as the climbing pink, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and fragrant, semi-double pink flowers.</p>
<p>It originates from a cross between Rosa pendulina and Rosa centifolia, resulting in a plant that combines the ornamental qualities of both parents. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and serrated, providing a lush backdrop to the blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a climber for trellises and fences.</p>
