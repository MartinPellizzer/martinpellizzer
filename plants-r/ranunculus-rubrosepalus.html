                    <h1>Ranunculus rubrosepalus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus rubrosepalus, commonly known as the red-sepal buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, bright yellow flowers with red sepals that distinguish it from other buttercup species. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but is considered rare in the wild.</p>
