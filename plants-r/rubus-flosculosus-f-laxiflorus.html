                    <h1>Rubus flosculosus f. laxiflorus</h1>
<p>Rubus flosculosus f. laxiflorus, commonly known as the looseflower raspberry, is a botanical variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive floral morphology.</p>
<p>This form exhibits larger, more loosely arranged flowers compared to the typical species, which enhances its ornamental appeal. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The fruit, like other raspberries, is aggregate, developing from multiple ovaria and containing small, seeded drupes.</p>
