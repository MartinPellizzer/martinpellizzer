<p>Renanthera storiei, commonly known as the Storie's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It produces aerial roots that help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Renanthera storiei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
