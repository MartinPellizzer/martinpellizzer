<p>Ruschia cradockensis subsp.</p>
<p>triticiformis, commonly known as the Cape sugarbush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
