                    <h1>Rhuacophila</h1>
<p>Rhuacophila, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. Rhuacophila species typically grow in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and habitat specificity, many species of Rhuacophila are considered endangered.</p>
