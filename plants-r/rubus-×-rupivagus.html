                    <h1>Rubus × rupivagus</h1>
<p>Rubus × rupivagus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typical of many bramble species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, commonly referred to as blackberries, which are edible and often used in culinary applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for breeding programs aimed at improving fruit quality and disease resistance.</p>
