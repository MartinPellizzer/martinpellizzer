<p>Rhamnus arenicola, commonly known as the sand buckthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and produces small, orange-red berries that are edible. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>The berries are also used in traditional medicine and as a source of food for wildlife.</p>
