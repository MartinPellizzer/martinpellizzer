                    <h1>Rhynchospora glomerata f. controversa</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora glomerata f. controversa, commonly known as the clustered spike sedge, is a botanical variant of the clustered spike sedge, characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its morphological variability, which has led to taxonomic debate among botanists.</p>
