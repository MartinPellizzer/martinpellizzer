                    <h1>Rubus × persterilis</h1>
<p>Rubus × persterilis, commonly known as the sterile blackberry.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus pectoralis. This plant is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that resemble blackberries but are typically smaller. Unlike its fertile relatives, it is sterile, meaning it does not produce viable seeds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and genetic studies.</p>
