                    <h1>Ranunculus firmulus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus firmulus, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a small herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces delicate, yellow flowers with five petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Ranunculus firmulus is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
