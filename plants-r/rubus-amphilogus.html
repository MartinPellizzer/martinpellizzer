                    <h1>Rubus amphilogus</h1>
<p>Rubus amphilogus, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red or black berries in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
