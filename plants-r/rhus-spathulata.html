                    <h1>Rhus spathulata</h1>
<p>Rhus spathulata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are broadly ovate to spatulate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are clustered in pairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Smooth sumac is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of dye.</p>
