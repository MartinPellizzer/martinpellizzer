                    <h1>Rosa canina var. nitidula</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. nitidula, commonly known as the smooth hips rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, shiny fruits that are typically orange to red in color, distinguishing it from the more common rough-hairy hips of Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in spring, followed by the characteristic rose hips in autumn. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its hips are valued for their ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
