<p>Ranunculus nyalamensis var. angustipetalus, commonly known as the narrow-petaled buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five narrow petals and a green, hairy stem. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
