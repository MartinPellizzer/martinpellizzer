<p>Ruschia herrei, commonly known as the silver leaf Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
