                            <h1>Rubus Chlorocaulon</h1>
<p>Green-stemmed blackberry, scientifically known as Rubus chlorocaulon, is a rare and striking member of the Rubus genus. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its unique green stems contrast sharply with its dark, velvety berries, making it a standout in the wild. The plant's unusual coloration is due to a combination of genetic traits and environmental factors. Despite its beauty, it remains under-studied and is often overlooked in favor of more common blackberry species.</p>
