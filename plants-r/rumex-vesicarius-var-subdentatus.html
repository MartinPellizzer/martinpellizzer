                    <h1>Rumex vesicarius var. subdentatus</h1>
<p>Rumex vesicarius var. subdentatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and serrated edges, which distinguish it from other dock species. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by triangular, spiny fruits. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
