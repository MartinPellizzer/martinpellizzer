<p>Rafnia retroflexa, commonly known as the redroot false hellebore, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and striking red-tipped spathes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which are toxic to humans and livestock. Rafnia retroflexa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores, which helps it survive in competitive plant communities.</p>
