The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are strap-like and succulent, adapted to store water in its native arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
