                    <h1>Rhinanthus heribaudii</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus heribaudii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy orange-yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. It is typically found in grasslands and meadows, often in association with grasses like wheat and rye.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus heribaudii plays an important role in promoting biodiversity by reducing the dominance of dominant grasses.</p>
