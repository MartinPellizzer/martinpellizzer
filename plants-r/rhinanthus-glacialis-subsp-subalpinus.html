<p>Rhinanthus glacialis subsp.</p>
<p>subalpinus, commonly known as the subalpine yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed alpine ecosystems.</p>
