<p>Rimaria primosii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater during dry periods.</p>
<p>Rimaria primosii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
