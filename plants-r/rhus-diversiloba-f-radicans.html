                    <h1>Rhus diversiloba f. radicans</h1>
<p>Rhus diversiloba f. radicans, commonly known as the creeping sumac, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically alternate and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats on forest floors.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
