<p>Rosa canina var. surreyana, commonly known as the Surrey rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to southern England.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like hips in autumn. These hips are edible and contain seeds that can be used for propagation.</p>
<p>The Surrey rose is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture.</p>
