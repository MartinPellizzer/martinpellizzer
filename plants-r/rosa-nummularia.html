<p>It features dense clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has rounded, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Rosa nummularia is relatively hardy and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
