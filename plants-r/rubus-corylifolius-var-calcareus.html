                    <h1>Rubus corylifolius var. calcareus</h1>
<p>Rubus corylifolius var. calcareus, commonly known as the limestone raspberry, is a variant of the bramble plant native to regions with limestone soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct, coarse texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
