<p>Rhus simii var. lydenburgensis, commonly known as the Lydenburg holly, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range.</p>
