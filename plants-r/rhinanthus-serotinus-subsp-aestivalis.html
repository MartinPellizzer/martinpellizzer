<p>Rhinanthus serotinus subsp.</p>
<p>aestivalis, commonly known as the early yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths, where it forms dense colonies. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in maintaining biodiversity by promoting grass growth and supporting insect populations.</p>
