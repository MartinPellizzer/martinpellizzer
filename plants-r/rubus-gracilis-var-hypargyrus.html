<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with finely toothed margins and a silvery undersurface that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. Its fruit, a small red drupe, ripens in late summer and is edible, though often tart and less commonly cultivated than other raspberries.</p>
