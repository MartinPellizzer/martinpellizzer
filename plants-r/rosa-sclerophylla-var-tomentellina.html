<p>Rosa sclerophylla var. tomentellina, commonly known as the woolly bramble rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves covered in a woolly, grayish pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in the spring, which are followed by oval, red-brown fruits known as hips. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions.</p>
