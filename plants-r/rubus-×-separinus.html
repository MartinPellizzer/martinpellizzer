                    <h1>Rubus × separinus</h1>
<p>Rubus × separinus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between blackberries (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberries (Rubus idaeus).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with thorny stems and compound leaves typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit genetic variability in fruit size, flavor, and growth habits.</p>
