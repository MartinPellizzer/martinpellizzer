                    <h1>Rubus ulmifolius var. albineus</h1>
<p>Rubus ulmifolius var. albineus, commonly known as the white-berried blackberry, is a variant of the common bramble.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white or pale pink fruits, which contrast with the typical dark berries of its parent species. The plant is a perennial shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves that are similar to those of the elm. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows.</p>
<p>Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces edible fruit that is less common than other blackberry varieties.</p>
