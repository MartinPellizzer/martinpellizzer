                    <h1>Rebutia spiralisepala</h1>
<p>Rebutia spiralisepala, commonly known as the spiral-leaf cactus, is a species native to South America, specifically Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaf-like stems, which are actually modified stems rather than true leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both an ornamental and ecologically interesting plant in arid environments.</p>
