                    <h1>Rumex × commutatus</h1>
<p>Rumex × commutatus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broad-leafed sorrel). The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
