                    <h1>Rafflesia tuanku-halimii</h1>
<p>Rafflesia tuanku-halimii, commonly known as the King's Crown Rafflesia, is a rare and striking plant found in the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing the largest individual flower in the world, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant is a parasitic species that lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is a symbol of Borneo's unique biodiversity.</p>
