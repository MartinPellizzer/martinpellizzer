<p>Reidia gracilipes, commonly known as the slender reidia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Reidia gracilipes is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
