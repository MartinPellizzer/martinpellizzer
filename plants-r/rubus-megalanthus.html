                    <h1>Rubus megalanthus</h1>
<p>Rubus megalanthus, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its size and fruit characteristics, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries, though it is less commonly grown than other blackberry varieties.</p>
