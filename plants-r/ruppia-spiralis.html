<p>Ruppia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that give it a distinctive spiral appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, though they may emerge slightly at the water's surface. Ruppia spiralis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It is also used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to absorb nutrients and heavy metals from the water.</p>
