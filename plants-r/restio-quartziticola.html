                    <h1>Restio quartziticola</h1>
<p>Restio quartziticola, commonly known as the quartzite restio, is a rare and specialized plant species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and rocky environments. This plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in quartzitic soils, which are typically well-drained and nutrient-poor, making it well-suited to rocky and coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Restio quartziticola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
