                    <h1>Ruscus alexandrinus</h1>
<p>Ruscus alexandrinus, commonly known as butcher's broom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, waxy, spiny leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish itself in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures.</p>
