<p>Rumex × impurus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and the plant produces small greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its edible leaves, which have a tart, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
