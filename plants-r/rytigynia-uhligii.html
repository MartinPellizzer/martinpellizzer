<p>Rytigynia uhligii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species.</p>
