<p>Rhus lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features compound leaves with 15 to 31 lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain one or two seeds.

<p>Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions make it a common invasive species in some regions.</p>
