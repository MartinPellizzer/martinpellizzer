<p>Rathbunia alamosensis f. cristata, commonly known as the Alamos crisped dandelion, is a rare and unique variant of the Alamos dandelion.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, and often branched inflorescence, which gives it a "cristate" or crested appearance. This plant is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona. Its botanical features include yellow flowers and a basal rosette of leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
