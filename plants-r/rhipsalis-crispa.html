<p>Rhipsalis crispa, commonly known as the silver mist cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, branching stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the winter months. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis crispa is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive, trailing growth habit.</p>
