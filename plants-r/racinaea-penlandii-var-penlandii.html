<p>Racinaea penlandii var. penlandii, commonly known as Penland's racinaea, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, enclosed by a spathe. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its aerial roots for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are small and clustered.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
