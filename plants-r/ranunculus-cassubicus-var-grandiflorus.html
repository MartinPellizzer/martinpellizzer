                    <h1>Ranunculus cassubicus var. grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus cassubicus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that float on the water surface or grow submerged, depending on the habitat. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers with five to nine petals, often with a distinctive central tuft of stamens. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, and its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing in the afternoon.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its larger, more showy blooms compared to other members of the species.</p>
