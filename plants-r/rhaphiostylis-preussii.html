                    <h1>Rhaphiostylis preussii</h1>
<p>Rhaphiostylis preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's star orchid, is a rare and delicate tropical orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
