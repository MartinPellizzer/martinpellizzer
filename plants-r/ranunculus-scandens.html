                    <h1>Ranunculus scandens</h1>
<p>Ranunculus scandens, commonly known as the climbing buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant is known for its climbing habit, often using tendrils to support itself on structures like fences or trees. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
