                    <h1>Rubus vulgaris var. discolor</h1>
<p>Rubus vulgaris var. discolor, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and its distinctive white-tinged berries, which are smaller and less tart than typical blackberries. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows.</p>
<p>The berries, while not as widely cultivated as other blackberry varieties, are valued for their unique flavor and ornamental qualities.</p>
