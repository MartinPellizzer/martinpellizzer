                    <h1>Rubus arduennensis var. minutispinus</h1>
<p>Rubus arduennensis var. minutispinus, commonly known as the dwarf bramble, is a shrub native to the humid forests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by edible, red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in undergrowth layers of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
