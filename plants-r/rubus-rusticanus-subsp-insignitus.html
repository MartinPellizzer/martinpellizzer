<p>Rubus rusticanus subsp.</p>
<p>insignitus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, aggregated flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color, though they are less commonly consumed than other raspberry species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
