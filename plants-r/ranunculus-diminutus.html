                    <h1>Ranunculus diminutus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus diminutus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, buttercup-like yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive waxy coating. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>While it is considered an early spring bloomer, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
