                    <h1>Ruellia nudiflora var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Ruellia nudiflora var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its tubular flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens.</p>
<p>The variety glabrata is distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the leaves, which sets it apart from other varieties of Ruellia nudiflora.</p>
