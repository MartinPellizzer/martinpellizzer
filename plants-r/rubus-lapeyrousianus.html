<p>Rubus lapeyrousianus, commonly known as the Lapeyrousian blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species within the Rubus genus.</p>
