<p>Rhynchospora stokesii f. saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola rush, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale brown flowers. This subspecies is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, reflecting its drought-tolerant nature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
