<p>Ramphocarpus, commonly known as the "spear-fruit" or "arrow-plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Ramphocarpus species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often clustered flowers. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Some species are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
