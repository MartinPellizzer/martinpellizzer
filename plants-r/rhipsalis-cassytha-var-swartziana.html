                    <h1>Rhipsalis cassytha var. swartziana</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis cassytha var. swartziana, commonly known as the silver leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of tropical trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, flexible stems that can trail or drape from its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help it blend with its host.</p>
<p>This species is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
