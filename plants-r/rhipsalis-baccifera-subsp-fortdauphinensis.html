<p>Rhipsalis baccifera subsp.</p>
<p>fortdauphinensis, commonly known as the Madagascar mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems that often hang in cascading clusters, giving it a delicate, vine-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
