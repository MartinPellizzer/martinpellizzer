The plant is native to specific regions in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded habitats. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
