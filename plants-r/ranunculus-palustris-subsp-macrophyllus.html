<p>Ranunculus palustris subsp.</p>
<p>macrophyllus, commonly known as the broadleaf water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often larger than those of the typical *Ranunculus palustris*. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
