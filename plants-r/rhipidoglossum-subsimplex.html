<p>Rhipidoglossum subsimplex, commonly known as the simple leafless liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. This liverwort thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called gametangia, are borne on the upper surface of the phyllidia.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
