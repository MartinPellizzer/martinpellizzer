<p>Ranunculus cassubicus subsp.</p>
<p>confinis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats.</p>
