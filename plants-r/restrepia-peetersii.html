                    <h1>Restrepia peetersii</h1>
<p>Restrepia peetersii, commonly known as the Peeters' orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, porous substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species in the wild.</p>
