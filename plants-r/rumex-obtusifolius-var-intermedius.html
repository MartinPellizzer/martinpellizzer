                    <h1>Rumex obtusifolius var. intermedius</h1>
<p>Rumex obtusifolius var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by triangular, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
