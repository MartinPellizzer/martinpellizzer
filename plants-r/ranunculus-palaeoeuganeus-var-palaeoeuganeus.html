                    <h1>Ranunculus palaeoeuganeus var. palaeoeuganeus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus palaeoeuganeus var. palaeoeuganeus, commonly known as the Paleoeuganean buttercup, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers with five to seven petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and evolutionary studies.</p>
