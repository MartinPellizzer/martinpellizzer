                    <h1>Rungia buettneri</h1>
<p>Rungia buettneri, commonly known as the velvetleaf or black nightshade, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fleshy, berry-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as rainforests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
