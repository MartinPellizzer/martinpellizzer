<p>Ranunculus maximus, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. Its leaves are palmately lobed and can grow quite large, sometimes reaching up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>Ranunculus maximus is adapted to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks.</p>
