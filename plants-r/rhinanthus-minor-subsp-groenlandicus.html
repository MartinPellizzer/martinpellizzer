<p>Rhinanthus minor subsp.</p>
<p>groenlandicus, commonly known as the Greenland yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Its short stature and specialized morphology reflect its ecological niche in harsh environments.</p>
