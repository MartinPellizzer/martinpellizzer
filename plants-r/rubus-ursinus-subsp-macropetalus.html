<p>Rubus ursinus subsp.</p>
<p>macropetalus, commonly known as the large-petaled blackberry, is a shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb or spread along the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupes, which are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its distinctive large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
