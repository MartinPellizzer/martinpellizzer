                    <h1>Rauvolfia sandwicensis</h1>
<p>Rauvolfia sandwicensis, commonly known as Hawaiian rue or the sacred mountain plant, is a flowering shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests and along streambanks. Its roots contain alkaloids, which have been historically used in traditional Hawaiian medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now considered endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
