                    <h1>Rosmarinus officinalis var. trogloditarum</h1>
<p>Rosmarinus officinalis var. trogloditarum, commonly known as the Troglodyte rosemary, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common rosemary plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage, which emits a strong, pine-like scent. This variety is native to specific regions in southern Europe and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically smaller and more densely packed compared to the standard rosemary.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
