                    <h1>Ranunculus hyperboreus f. integrescens</h1>
<p>Ranunculus hyperboreus f. integrescens, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a rare alpine plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
