                    <h1>Rhododendron buxifolium var. robustum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron buxifolium var. robustum, commonly known as the broadleaf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with leathery, elliptical leaves that are broader than those of typical rhododendrons. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, often in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler, humid climates.</p>
