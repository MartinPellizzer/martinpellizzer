                    <h1>Ruppia maritima var. spiralis</h1>
<p>Ruppia maritima var. spiralis, commonly known as spiral sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which is a distinguishing feature of this variant. The plant typically grows in shallow coastal waters and estuaries, where it thrives in brackish conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are pollinated by wind, and it produces small, oval fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>This variant plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
