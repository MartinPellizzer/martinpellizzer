<p>Rostraria salzmannii subsp.</p>
<p>cossoniana, commonly known as the Cosson's rostraria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure includes a distinctive rostellum, a specialized appendage that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
