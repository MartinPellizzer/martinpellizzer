                    <h1>Rosa canina f. lagenoides</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. lagenoides, commonly known as the smooth hips rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, rounded fruit (hips) that lack the typical prickles found on the standard Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
