                    <h1>Rosa giraldii f. glabriuscula</h1>
<p>Rosa giraldii f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous form of the alpine rose, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, thornless stems and small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The leaves are typically dark green and covered with fine, short hairs, though the glabrous form has reduced hair coverage. Its flowers, which bloom in early summer, are usually pink to red in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate colder climates.</p>
