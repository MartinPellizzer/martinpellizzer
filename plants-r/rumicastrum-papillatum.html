                    <h1>Rumicastrum papillatum</h1>
<p>Rumicastrum papillatum, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are rich in nutrients and have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>The plant also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds.</p>
