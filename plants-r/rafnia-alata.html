                    <h1>Rafnia alata</h1>
<p>Rafnia alata, commonly known as the giant sycamore, is a large deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive trunk, thick bark, and broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Rafnia alata has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to windthrow, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
