                            <h1>Ranunculus Acris Subsp. Borealis</h1>
<p>Boreal buttercup, scientifically known as Ranunculus acris subsp. borealis, is a hardy perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes, often found in areas with short growing seasons. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and finely divided leaves, which help it adapt to harsh climates. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested, making it a plant to admire from a distance. Its resilience and striking appearance make it a notable species in the flora of boreal and alpine ecosystems.</p>
