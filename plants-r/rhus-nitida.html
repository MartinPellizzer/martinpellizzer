                    <h1>Rhus nitida</h1>
<p>Rhus nitida, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into the winter. Rhus nitida is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woods.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems and a popular ornamental plant.</p>
