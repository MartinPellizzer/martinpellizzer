                    <h1>Rumex salinus</h1>
<p>Rumex salinus, commonly known as saltbush or seaside sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize disturbed or salty soils effectively.</p>
<p>Rumex salinus is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other saline environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
