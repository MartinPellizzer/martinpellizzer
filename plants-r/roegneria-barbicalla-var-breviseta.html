                    <h1>Roegneria barbicalla var. breviseta</h1>
<p>Roegneria barbicalla var. breviseta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience.</p>
