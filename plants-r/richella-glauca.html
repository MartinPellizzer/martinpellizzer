                    <h1>Richella glauca</h1>
<p>Richella glauca, commonly known as the blue-green lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact thallus that ranges in color from pale green to blue-green. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. Its structure allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Richella glauca is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forest regions.</p>
