                    <h1>Rubus leucocarpus var. tomentosus</h1>
<p>Rubus leucocarpus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, tomentose leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are typically not as flavorful as other blackberry varieties. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
