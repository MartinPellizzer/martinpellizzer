<p>Ribes alpinum var. sterile, commonly known as the sterile gooseberry, is a variant of the alpine gooseberry native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, edible berries that are typically seedless due to its sterile nature. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage consists of dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities.</p>
