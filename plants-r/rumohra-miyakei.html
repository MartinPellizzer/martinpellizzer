<p>Rumohra miyakei, commonly known as the Miyake's sedge, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in association with other understory vegetation. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, a common feature among sedges.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
