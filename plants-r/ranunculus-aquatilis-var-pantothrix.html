                    <h1>Ranunculus aquatilis var. pantothrix</h1>
<p>Ranunculus aquatilis var. pantothrix, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, and has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in its habitat.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
