                    <h1>Rhynchospora globularis var. saxicola</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora globularis var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock globular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, sandy soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its compact, globular appearance, which gives it its common name.</p>
