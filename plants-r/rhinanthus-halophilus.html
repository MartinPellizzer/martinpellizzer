                    <h1>Rhinanthus halophilus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus halophilus, commonly known as the salt meadow rhinocerosflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in sandy or salty soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
