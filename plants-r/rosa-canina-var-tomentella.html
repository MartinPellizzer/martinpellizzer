                    <h1>Rosa canina var. tomentella</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by orange-red hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
