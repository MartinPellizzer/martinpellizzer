                    <h1>Rosa communis var. glauca</h1>
<p>Rosa communis var. glauca, commonly known as the blue rose, is a botanical variety of the rose plant that is notable for its unique bluish-pink flower color.</p>
<p>This coloration is due to the presence of a pigment called delphinidin, which is not typically found in common roses. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rosa genus. It produces fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is relatively rare in cultivation and is often grown for its ornamental value.</p>
