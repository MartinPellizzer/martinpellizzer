<p>Roeperocharis ukingensis, commonly known as the Ukinge's orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the montane forests of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has a short rhizome and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to its shady, humid habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
