<p>Raphionacme palustris, commonly known as the marsh needlegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
