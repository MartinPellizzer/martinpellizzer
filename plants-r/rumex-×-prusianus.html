                    <h1>Rumex × prusianus</h1>
<p>Rumex × prusianus, commonly known as Prussian knotweed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (sorrel) and Rumex patientia (broad-leaved dock).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, curled, reddish-brown leaves that resemble small knots, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
