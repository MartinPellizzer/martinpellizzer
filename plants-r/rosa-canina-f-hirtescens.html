                    <h1>Rosa canina f. hirtescens</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. hirtescens, commonly known as the hairy rose dogwood, is a botanical variant of the common rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bristly hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red hips in the autumn. Its hairy texture is a result of specialized trichomes that provide protection against herbivores and environmental stress.</p>
<p>This form is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
