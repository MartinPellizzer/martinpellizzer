<p>Rhynchospora amazonica subsp.</p>
<p>guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is part of the Cyperaceae family, which includes many other sedges and related plants.</p>
