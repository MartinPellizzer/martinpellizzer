<p>Rubus bracteosus var. densipilosus, commonly known as the dense-hairy raspberry, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its dense pubescence, or hairy covering, gives it its varietal name and helps protect it from herbivores.</p>
