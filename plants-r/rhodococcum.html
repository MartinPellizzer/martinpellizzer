                    <h1>Rhodococcum</h1>
<p>Rhodococcum, commonly known as a genus of actinomycete bacteria, is primarily recognized for its role in soil ecosystems.</p>
<p>These microorganisms are known for their ability to degrade a wide range of organic compounds, contributing to nutrient cycling. Rhodococcum species are often found in soil, water, and even in association with plants. They are aerobic, gram-positive bacteria that form branching filaments.</p>
<p>Some species of Rhodococcum have been studied for their potential in bioremediation due to their metabolic versatility.</p>
