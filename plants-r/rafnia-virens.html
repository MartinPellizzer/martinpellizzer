                    <h1>Rafnia virens</h1>
<p>Rafnia virens, commonly known as the green ant plant, is a unique species belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, leaf-like structures that resemble ants, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spathe, a modified leaf that encloses the true flowers. Rafnia virens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
