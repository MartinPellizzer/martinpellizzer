<p>Rorida droserifolia, commonly known as the Florida sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Florida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded environments. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped, with a rosy hue that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
