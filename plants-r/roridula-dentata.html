                    <h1>Roridula dentata</h1>
<p>Roridula dentata, commonly known as the sticky roridula, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that secrete a viscous substance, which is believed to aid in water retention and possibly in capturing small insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often described as being covered in a fine, waxy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Roridula dentata is adapted to arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
