                            <h1>Roettlera Lyrata</h1>
<p>Roettlera lyrata is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. Its name, meaning "lyre-shaped," refers to the unique shape of its leaves which resemble the ancient musical instrument. This plant is known for its delicate pink and white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss, Roettlera lyrata is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
