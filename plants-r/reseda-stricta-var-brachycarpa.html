<p>Reseda stricta var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited sickleweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are short and club-shaped, giving it the specific epithet *brachycarpa*.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
