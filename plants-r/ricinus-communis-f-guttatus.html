                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. guttatus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. guttatus, commonly known as the curly leaf castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its uniquely curled and twisted leaves.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is native to tropical regions and is often cultivated for its striking foliage rather than its seeds. The leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture and exhibit a broad range of curling patterns. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used for oil production, it is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
