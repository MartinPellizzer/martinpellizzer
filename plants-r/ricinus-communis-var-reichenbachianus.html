<p>Ricinus communis var. reichenbachianus, commonly known as the red leaf castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking red and green variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant leaf colors and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for households with children or pets.</p>
