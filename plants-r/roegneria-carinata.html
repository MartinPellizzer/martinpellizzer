<p>Roegneria carinata, commonly known as the awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often bear awns on the lemma. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with two to three bract-like glumes. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine hairs, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Roegneria carinata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
