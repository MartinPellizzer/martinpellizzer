<p>Retinaria, commonly known as the "false holly," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Retinaria species are characterized by their spiny, evergreen leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to red. The fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, and some species have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value and sometimes toxic properties, they are cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
