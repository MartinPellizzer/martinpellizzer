                    <h1>Rhus retusa</h1>
<p>Rhus retusa, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that resembles the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are compound, with 11 to 31 oval-shaped leaflets, and they turn bright red in the fall.</p>
<p>Rhus retusa is often found in dry, open woodlands and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
