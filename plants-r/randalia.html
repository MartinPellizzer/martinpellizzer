                    <h1>Randalia</h1>
<p>Randalia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, compound leaves, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. Randalia species are often valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and tool-making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
