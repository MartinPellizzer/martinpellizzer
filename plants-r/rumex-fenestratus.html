                    <h1>Rumex fenestratus</h1>
<p>Rumex fenestratus, commonly known as the fen dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pinnately lobed leaves, which often have a fenestrated (fenestrated) appearance, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity and water filtration in its habitat.</p>
