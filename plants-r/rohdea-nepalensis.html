                    <h1>Rohdea nepalensis</h1>
<p>Rohdea nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal lily, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its mountainous habitat. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, pale green to white flowers, which are typically less showy than those of other Zingiberaceae species.</p>
<p>Rohdea nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>
