                    <h1>Romanzoffia suksdorfii</h1>
<p>Romanzoffia suksdorfii, commonly known as the Sushkoff's waterwheel, is a rare aquatic plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique whorl of leaves that resemble the structure of a waterwheel, which helps it float on the surface of water bodies. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in lakes and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and spirally arranged, providing efficient light absorption for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
