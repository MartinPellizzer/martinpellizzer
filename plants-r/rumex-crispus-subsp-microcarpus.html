<p>Rumex crispus subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpus, commonly known as curled dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its serrated, wavy-edged leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
