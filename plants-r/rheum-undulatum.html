                    <h1>Rheum undulatum</h1>
<p>Rheum undulatum, commonly known as the undulating rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, and its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other well-known species like buckthorn and sorrel. Its rhubarb-like stems are edible but are typically not consumed due to their high oxalic acid content.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
