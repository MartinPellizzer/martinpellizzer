                    <h1>Rosa canina var. pilosiuscula</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. pilosiuscula, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright orange to red hips in the fall. Its hairy texture is a result of dense pubescence on the stems, leaves, and flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has some historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
