<p>Rumex acetosa subsp.</p>
<p>planellae, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the typical R. acetosa, which contributes to its distinct botanical identity.</p>
