                    <h1>Rosa canina f. amphibola</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. amphibola, commonly known as the amphibola rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral features, which set it apart from the typical Rosa canina. This form is notable for its ability to thrive in moist environments, making it adaptable to wetter soils than the standard species. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red hips in autumn.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological traits and ecological niche.</p>
