                    <h1>Romanzoffia</h1>
<p>Romanzoffia, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Romanzoffia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful bioindicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
