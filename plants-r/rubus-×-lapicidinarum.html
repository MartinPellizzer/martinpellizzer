                    <h1>Rubus × lapicidinarum</h1>
<p>Rubus × lapicidinarum, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry).</p>
<p>This plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring a shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and compound leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, edible berries that are often a mix of blackberry and raspberry flavors. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit genetic variability in morphology and fruit quality.</p>
