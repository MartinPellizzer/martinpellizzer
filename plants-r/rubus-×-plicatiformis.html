                    <h1>Rubus × plicatiformis</h1>
<p>Rubus × plicatiformis, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between a blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) and a raspberry (Rubus idaeus).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a distinctive tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a unique subject of botanical study.</p>
