                    <h1>Rubus vulnificus</h1>
<p>Rubus vulnificus, commonly known as the poison ivy raspberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by red, hairy berries. It is known for its toxic properties, as the berries contain urushiol, which can cause skin irritation in humans.</p>
<p>Despite its harmful effects, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
