<p>Rhynchospora patula, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Its flowering spikes are usually shorter than its leaves, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Rhynchospora patula plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
