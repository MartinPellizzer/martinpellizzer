<p>Rumex cyprius subsp.</p>
<p>vesceritensis, commonly known as Cyprus sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on erect, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
