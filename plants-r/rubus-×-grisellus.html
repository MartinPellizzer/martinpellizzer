                    <h1>Rubus × grisellus</h1>
<p>Rubus × grisellus, commonly known as the blackberry-elderberry hybrid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus fruticosus (blackberry) and Rubus caesius (elderberry).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in plant taxonomy and horticulture.</p>
