                    <h1>Rebutia pauciareolata</h1>
<p>Rebutia pauciareolata, commonly known as the sparse areola euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with multiple branching stems that produce clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its growth is slow, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid environments.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
