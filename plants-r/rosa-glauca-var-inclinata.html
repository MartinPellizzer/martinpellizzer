<p>Rosa glauca var. inclinata, commonly known as the blue rose or blue shrub rose, is a variant of the Rosa glauca species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep blue or violet flower color, which is a rare trait in roses due to the presence of delphinidin, a type of anthocyanin pigment. The plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique coloration.</p>
