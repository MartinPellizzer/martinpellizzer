                    <h1>Rumicastrum sphaerophyllum</h1>
<p>Rumicastrum sphaerophyllum, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Rumicastrum sphaerophyllum is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in dry landscapes.</p>
