<p>Razoumofskya cupressodes, commonly known as the dwarf cypress, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It has a compact, rounded growth habit with scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers followed by tiny, berry-like cones. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscape design for its neat appearance and hardiness.</p>
