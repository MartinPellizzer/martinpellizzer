                    <h1>Ranunculus pascuicola</h1>
<p>Ranunculus pascuicola, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soil. The plant features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 13 petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with a hairy texture. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Ranunculus pascuicola is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
