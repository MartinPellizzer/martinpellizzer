                    <h1>Rosa alpiniformis</h1>
<p>Rosa alpiniformis, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh alpine conditions. It produces hips, which are the fruit of the rose, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Rosa alpiniformis is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
