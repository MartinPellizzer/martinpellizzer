<p>Racinaea almeriae, commonly known as the Almer√≠a racemose, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive racemose inflorescence, which consists of small, white flowers arranged in a branching pattern. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in the Mediterranean climate of southern Spain. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Racinaea almeriae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
