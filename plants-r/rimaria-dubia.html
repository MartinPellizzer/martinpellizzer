<p>Rimaria dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique botanical features make it highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Rimaria dubia is classified as critically endangered.</p>
