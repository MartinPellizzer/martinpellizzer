                    <h1>Rigiolepis argentii</h1>
<p>Rigiolepis argentii, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
