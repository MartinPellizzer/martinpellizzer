<p>Rorippa islandica subsp.</p>
<p>fernaldiana, commonly known as the Alaska sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing herb that typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in polar ecosystems.</p>
