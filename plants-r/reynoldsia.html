                    <h1>Reynoldsia</h1>
<p>Reynoldsia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. Reynoldsia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
