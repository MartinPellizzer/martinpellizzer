                    <h1>Rosa dinotoma</h1>
<p>Rosa dinotoma, commonly known as the fossil rose, is a genus of flowering plants that is primarily known from fossil records rather than being a currently existing species.</p>
<p>It is believed to have thrived during the Cretaceous period, approximately 145 to 66 million years ago. The plant is characterized by its complex floral structures, which provide valuable insights into the evolution of angiosperms. Fossilized remains of Rosa dinotoma have been found in various locations, including North America and Europe.</p>
<p>These fossils help scientists understand the morphology and ecological roles of ancient plant life.</p>
