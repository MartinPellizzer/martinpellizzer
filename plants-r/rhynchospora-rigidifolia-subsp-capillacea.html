<p>Rhynchospora rigidifolia subsp.</p>
<p>capillacea, commonly known as the slender beak-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 20â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairless or sparingly hairy.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable moist habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves, distinguishing it from other members of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
