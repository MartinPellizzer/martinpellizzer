                    <h1>Rawsonia</h1>
<p>Rawsonia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their distinctive silver-gray foliage. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Rawsonia species often have small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
