<p>Rosa obtusifolia subsp.</p>
<p>tomentella, commonly known as the woolly shrub rose, is a shrub-like species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its thorny stems and compact growth habit make it suitable for use in hedges or as a decorative plant in gardens.</p>
<p>The subspecies is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
