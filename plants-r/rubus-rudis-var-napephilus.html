<p>Rubus rudis var. napephilus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to rocky or sandy substrates. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture, adapting to the harsh coastal climate.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its resilience and is often found in disturbed or saline environments.</p>
