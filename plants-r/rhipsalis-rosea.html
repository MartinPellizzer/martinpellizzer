<p>Rhipsalis rosea, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching stems covered in small, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, well-draining environments and requires indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
