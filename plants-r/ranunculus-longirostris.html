                    <h1>Ranunculus longirostris</h1>
<p>Ranunculus longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of sharply lobed, glossy green leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five to nine sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers have a long, slender beak-like structure at the tip of the pistil. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
