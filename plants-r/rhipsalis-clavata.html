                    <h1>Rhipsalis clavata</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis clavata, commonly known as the clustered Christmas cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the winter months. Its leaves are modified into small, pointed structures called phylloids, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis clavata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
