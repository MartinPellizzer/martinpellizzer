                    <h1>Rhamnus utilis var. utilis</h1>
<p>Rhamnus utilis var. utilis, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 2â€“6 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
