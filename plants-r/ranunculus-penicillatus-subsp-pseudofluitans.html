<p>Ranunculus penicillatus subsp.</p>
<p>pseudofluitans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves and showy yellow flowers with numerous stamens.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it floats or is submerged. Its submerged leaves are finely divided and often appear as a dense mat on the water surface.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to aquatic environments, with specialized structures that help it anchor and absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
