<p>Rebutia einsteinii subsp.</p>
<p>aureiflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from both its unique shape and vibrant floral display.</p>
