                    <h1>Rubus pileatus var. canotomentosus</h1>
<p>Rubus pileatus var. canotomentosus, commonly known as the white-leaf bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely white-tomentose (fuzzy) underside leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, and it produces edible berries that are similar to other Rubus species.</p>
<p>The plant has a sprawling growth habit and can form dense thickets, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain areas.</p>
