                    <h1>Rubus allegheniensis var. albinus</h1>
<p>Rubus allegheniensis var. albinus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the Allegheny blackberry native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white berries, which are smaller and less flavorful compared to typical blackberries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique fruit coloration and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
