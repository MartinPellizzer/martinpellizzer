<p>Rosa glauca var. gemina, commonly known as the twin blue rose, is a rare and striking variant of the blue rose.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored flowers, which are more intensely pigmented than those of the typical Rosa glauca.

The plant's foliage is dark green and often covered in a fine, silvery down, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
