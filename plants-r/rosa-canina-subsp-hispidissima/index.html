                            <h1>Rosa Canina Subsp. Hispidissima</h1>
<p>Rosa canina subsp. hispidissima is a lesser-known variant of the dog rose, native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. This subspecies is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring. Unlike the more common Rosa canina, it possesses a more rugged appearance with hairy leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive look. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in scrublands and woodland edges. Despite its modest size, this plant holds ecological significance, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small wildlife.</p>
