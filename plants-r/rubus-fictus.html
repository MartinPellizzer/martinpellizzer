                    <h1>Rubus fictus</h1>
<p>Rubus fictus, commonly known as the false blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to true blackberries, it is sometimes mistaken for related species in the Rubus genus.</p>
