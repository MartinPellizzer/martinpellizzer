<p>Rhododendron dilatatum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine rhododendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
