<p>Rubus vallisparsus var. rigidipilus, commonly known as the rigid-hairy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Its rigid, bristly hairs on the stems and leaves give it its distinguishing name.</p>
<p>This species is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
