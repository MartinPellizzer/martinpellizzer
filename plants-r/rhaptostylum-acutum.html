                    <h1>Rhaptostylum acutum</h1>
<p>Rhaptostylum acutum, commonly known as the sharp-tipped orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, intricately shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. Its reproductive system relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and fragile ecosystem, Rhaptostylum acutum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
