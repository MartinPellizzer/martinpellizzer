                    <h1>Rhododendron muscipulum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron muscipulum, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple flowers and its unique ability to trap and digest insects using specialized leaf structures called pitchers. The plant's leaves are modified into tubular shapes that secrete a sticky fluid to lure and trap prey. The pitchers also contain digestive enzymes that break down the captured insects, providing the plant with essential nutrients.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
