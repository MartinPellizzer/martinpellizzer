                    <h1>Rosa caryophyllacea var. gypsicola</h1>
<p>Rosa caryophyllacea var. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils, often found in rocky or gypsum-rich environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh, dry climates.</p>
