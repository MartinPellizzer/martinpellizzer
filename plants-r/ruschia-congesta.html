                    <h1>Ruschia congesta</h1>
<p>Ruschia congesta, commonly known as the clustered Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, low-growing stems that produce dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Ruschia congesta is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
