<p>Rhytiglossa microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in greenish-white or yellowish hues.</p>
<p>Rhytiglossa microphylla relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some degree of protection to the host tree through its parasitic relationship.</p>
