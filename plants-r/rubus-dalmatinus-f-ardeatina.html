                    <h1>Rubus dalmatinus f. ardeatina</h1>
<p>Rubus dalmatinus f. ardeatina, commonly known as the Ardeatina blackberry, is a unique horticultural form of the common blackberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black fruits that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus dalmatinus. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by its distinctive dark berries in the summer.</p>
<p>This form is prized for its ornamental value and the intense flavor of its fruits.</p>
