<p>Rhamnus alaternus f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ornamental landscaping.</p>
