<p>Rapanea volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic rapanea, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the volcanic highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Rapanea volcanica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
