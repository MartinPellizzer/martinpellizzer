                    <h1>Robiquetia bifida</h1>
<p>Robiquetia bifida, commonly known as the split-leaved rock orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it its scientific name, "bifida" meaning "split.". The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Robiquetia bifida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
