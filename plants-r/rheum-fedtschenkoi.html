<p>Rheum fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Tibetan rhubarb, is a species of the genus Rheum native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its large, broad leaves and stout, reddish stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its rhubarb-like appearance and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its habitat in remote and ecologically sensitive areas, it is considered rare and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
