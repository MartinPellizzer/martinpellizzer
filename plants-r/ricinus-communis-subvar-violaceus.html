                    <h1>Ricinus communis subvar. violaceus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis subvar. violaceus, commonly known as the purple castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking violet-colored foliage.</p>
<p>This subvariety is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires caution due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin.</p>
