                    <h1>Rumex hippolapathum var. domesticus</h1>
<p>Rumex hippolapathum var. domesticus, commonly known as the domestic sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stalks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation.</p>
