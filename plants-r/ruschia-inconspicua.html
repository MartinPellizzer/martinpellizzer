                    <h1>Ruschia inconspicua</h1>
<p>Ruschia inconspicua, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for cultivation in Mediterranean climates.</p>
