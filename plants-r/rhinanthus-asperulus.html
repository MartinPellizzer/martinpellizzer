                    <h1>Rhinanthus asperulus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus asperulus, commonly known as the rough horseweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature, though it is not fully parasitic and can photosynthesize. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands, often in disturbed soils. It produces yellow flowers in late summer, and its leaves are rough to the touch, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus asperulus is considered a rare and declining species in many regions, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
