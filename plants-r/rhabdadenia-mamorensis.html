<p>Rhabdadenia mamorensis, commonly known as the Mamore cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem that typically grows up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often clustered at the apex of the stems. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Rhabdadenia mamorensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
