                    <h1>Restrepia trichoglossa</h1>
<p>Restrepia trichoglossa, commonly known as the golden rosette orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive trichoglossa structure, which is a specialized feature in the orchid family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires periods of dryness followed by cool, moist conditions to trigger flowering.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
