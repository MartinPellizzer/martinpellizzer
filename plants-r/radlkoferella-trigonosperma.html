<p>Radlkoferella trigonosperma, commonly known as the three-seeded sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by three-angled, ribbed fruits that are distinctive in appearance. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny shell, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts.</p>
