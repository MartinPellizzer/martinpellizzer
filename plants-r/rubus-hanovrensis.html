<p>Rubus hanovrensis, commonly known as the Hanover blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for local food production.</p>
