<p>It belongs to the family Rhopalocnemidae and is characterized by its elongated, shield-shaped body covered in a waxy, pale green to yellowish exoskeleton. The plant it inhabits, typically woody shrubs or trees, provides both shelter and a source of moisture. Its feeding habits involve piercing and sucking plant tissues, which can cause damage to the host plant.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to entomologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
