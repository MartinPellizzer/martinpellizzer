                    <h1>Ranunculus apiculatus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus apiculatus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features a short, hairy stem that supports its delicate, cup-shaped flowers, which are usually bright yellow with dark centers. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Ranunculus apiculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
