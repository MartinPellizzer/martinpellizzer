                    <h1>Rhodopsis</h1>
<p>Rhodopsis, commonly known as the "rose of the sea," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Rhodopsis species are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. They are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs, with some species reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance and unique appearance, rhodopsis plants are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
