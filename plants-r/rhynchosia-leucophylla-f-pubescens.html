                    <h1>Rhynchosia leucophylla f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Rhynchosia leucophylla f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy white-flowered legume, is a variant of the species Rhynchosia leucophylla, characterized by its pubescent or hairy foliage.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. The plant typically features trifoliate leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its hairy texture is a distinguishing feature, likely an adaptation to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
