                    <h1>Rhinanthus major f. serotinus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus major f. serotinus, commonly known as the late yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. This subspecies is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom later in the season compared to the typical form. It typically grows in grasslands and meadows, often in association with grasses like Festuca and Poa.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in supporting pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity.</p>
