<p>Ranunculus turneri subsp.</p>
<p>jacuticus, commonly known as the Jacutian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, palmately arranged leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
