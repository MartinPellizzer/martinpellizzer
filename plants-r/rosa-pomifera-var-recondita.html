                    <h1>Rosa pomifera var. recondita</h1>
<p>Rosa pomifera var. recondita, commonly known as the wild rose of the Caucasus, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible hips, which are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with other Rosa species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
