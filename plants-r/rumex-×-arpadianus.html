<p>Rumex × arpadianus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tint and a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.
