<p>Rhamnus pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its desert environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by dark blue berries. Its bark is often covered in a thick, corky layer, which helps protect it from extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Rhamnus pachyphylla plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing food for local wildlife.</p>
