<p>Rhabarbarum verum, commonly known as true rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stalks and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, triangular fruits.
