                    <h1>Rafflesia micropylora</h1>
<p>Rafflesia micropylora, commonly known as the small-pelted rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is notable for its large, reddish-orange flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor reminiscent of decaying flesh to attract pollinators like flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia micropylora is considered endangered and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of Southeast Asian rainforests.</p>
