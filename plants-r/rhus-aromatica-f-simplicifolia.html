<p>Rhus aromatica f. simplicifolia, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are made up of 10 to 30 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a common food source for birds. Its aromatic leaves and stems release a strong, resinous scent when crushed, which is a distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils.</p>
