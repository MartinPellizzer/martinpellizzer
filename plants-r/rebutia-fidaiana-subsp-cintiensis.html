<p>Rebutia fidaiana subsp.</p>
<p>cintiensis, commonly known as the Cintiensi Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
