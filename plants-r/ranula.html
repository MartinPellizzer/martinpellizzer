                    <h1>Ranula</h1>
<p>Ranula, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a type of orchid characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like structure in its flower.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus *Pterocoryne* and is native to Australia, particularly in the southern regions. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with a rosette of leaves and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, bulbous lower lip. Ranulas are known for their ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and are often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study.</p>
