                    <h1>Rubus × peracutifrons</h1>
<p>Rubus × peracutifrons, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or dewberry, is a species resulting from the natural cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus pectoralis.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a sweet to tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that exhibits traits from both parent plants.</p>
