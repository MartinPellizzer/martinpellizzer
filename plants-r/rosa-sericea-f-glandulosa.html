                    <h1>Rosa sericea f. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Rosa sericea f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular silvery rose, is a variant of the silvery rose species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>The glandular hairs on its leaves also help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
