                    <h1>Rhododendron degronianum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron degronianum, commonly known as the De Gr√∂ningen rhododendron, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value has led to increased interest in cultivation, though its conservation status remains critical due to habitat loss.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often found in specialized botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
