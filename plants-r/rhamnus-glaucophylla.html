                    <h1>Rhamnus glaucophylla</h1>
<p>Rhamnus glaucophylla, commonly known as the silver-leafed buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a waxy, silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and contribute to its ecological significance in native plant communities.</p>
