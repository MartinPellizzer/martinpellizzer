<p>Rubus furvus subsp.</p>
<p>notabilis, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that turn red when mature.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for local foraging.</p>
