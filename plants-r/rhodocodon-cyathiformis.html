<p>Rhodocodon cyathiformis, commonly known as the cup-shaped bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant features a short, upright stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhodocodon cyathiformis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
