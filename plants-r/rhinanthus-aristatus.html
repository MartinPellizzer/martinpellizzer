                    <h1>Rhinanthus aristatus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus aristatus, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wet meadows and marshes in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in dense clusters.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus aristatus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
