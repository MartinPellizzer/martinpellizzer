                    <h1>Rubus silvaticus microgene splendidiflorus</h1>
<p>Rubus silvaticus microgene splendidiflorus, commonly known as the splendid-flowered wild raspberry, is a species of bramble native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black when mature, though they are often smaller and less flavorful than common raspberries. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its hybrid origins, combining traits from several Rubus species.</p>
