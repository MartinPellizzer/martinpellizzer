                    <h1>Rephesis</h1>
<p>Rephesis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow during the night. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that open only under specific lunar conditions, making it difficult to study. Its botanical classification remains uncertain, with some botanists suggesting it belongs to the nightshade family.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, rephesis is considered an endangered species.</p>
