                    <h1>Rumex maximus</h1>
<p>Rumex maximus, commonly known as sour dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically arranged in a terminal panicle. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The leaves and roots are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures.</p>
