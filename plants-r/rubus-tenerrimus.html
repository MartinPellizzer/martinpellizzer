                <h1>Rubus tenerrimus</h1>
<p>Rubus tenerrimus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are less commonly consumed than other raspberry species. Rubus tenerrimus thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions.</p>
