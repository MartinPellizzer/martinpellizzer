                    <h1>Rumex jacutensis</h1>
<p>Rumex jacutensis, commonly known as the Siberian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically red-veined and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Rumex jacutensis is often found in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and in mountainous regions.</p>
