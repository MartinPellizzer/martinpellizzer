<p>Reaumuria halophila, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to harsh, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are extensive and help stabilize soil in degraded or salty habitats.</p>
<p>Reaumuria halophila is an important species in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in extreme conditions.</p>
