                    <h1>Rulingia cuneata</h1>
<p>Rulingia cuneata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that contain winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used in fine woodworking and traditional crafts.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered threatened in many parts of its range.</p>
