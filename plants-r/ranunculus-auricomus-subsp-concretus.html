<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>concretus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with broad, petal-like sepals that resemble a crown.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are deeply divided and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The subspecies concretus is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flowers compared to the typical form of R. auricomus.</p>
