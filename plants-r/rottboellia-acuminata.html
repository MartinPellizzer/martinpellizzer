                    <h1>Rottboellia acuminata</h1>
<p>Rottboellia acuminata, commonly known as the slender grass or panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a weed and a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to produce viable seeds that disperse easily.</p>
