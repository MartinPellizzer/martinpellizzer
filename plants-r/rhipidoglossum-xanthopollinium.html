                    <h1>Rhipidoglossum xanthopollinium</h1>
<p>Rhipidoglossum xanthopollinium, commonly known as the golden-pollen lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The lichen's distinctive yellowish to orange-colored medulla is a key feature, contributing to its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on calcareous substrates in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
