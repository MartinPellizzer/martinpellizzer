                    <h1>Rhyssocarpus</h1>
<p>Rhyssocarpus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky, and often blue or purple-colored flowers that resemble sea stars, hence their common name. Rhyssocarpus species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. They have a rosette growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Rhyssocarpus maritimus, which is native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
