<p>Ricinocarpus cinctus, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spadices, typical of the Araceae family. Ricinocarpus cinctus thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity allows it to play a crucial role in coastal stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
