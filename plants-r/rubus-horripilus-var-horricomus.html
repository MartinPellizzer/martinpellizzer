<p>Rubus horripilus var. horricomus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus characterized by its thorny stems and dense growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in temperate regions, thriving in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or black berries in the fall. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
