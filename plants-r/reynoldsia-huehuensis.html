<p>Reynoldsia huehuensis, commonly known as the Huemul orchid, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Andes of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers and upright, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its small size and limited distribution make it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
