                    <h1>Rathkea</h1>
<p>Rathkea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique and rare plant species native to the remote highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal in sunlight, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only during the night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Rathkea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific combination of soil and temperature conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
