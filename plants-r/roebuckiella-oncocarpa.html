                    <h1>Roebuckiella oncocarpa</h1>
<p>Roebuckiella oncocarpa, commonly known as the red-stemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, an adaptation to its dry environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged closely along the stems, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Roebuckiella oncocarpa is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
