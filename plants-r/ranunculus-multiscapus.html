                    <h1>Ranunculus multiscapus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus multiscapus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Ranunculus multiscapus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
