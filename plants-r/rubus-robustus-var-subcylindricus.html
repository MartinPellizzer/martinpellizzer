                    <h1>Rubus robustus var. subcylindricus</h1>
<p>Rubus robustus var. subcylindricus, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and smaller, more compact leaves compared to other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less palatable than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
