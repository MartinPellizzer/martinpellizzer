                    <h1>Ribes sativum f. macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Ribes sativum f. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited gooseberry, is a cultivated form of the gooseberry plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, edible berries that are typically larger and more flavorful than those of the common gooseberry. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which develop into the distinctive red or orange berries by late summer. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>This variety is often grown for its ornamental value and culinary use in jams and preserves.</p>
