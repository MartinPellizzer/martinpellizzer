<p>Roycea spinescens, commonly known as the spiny rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand strong sunlight and cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
