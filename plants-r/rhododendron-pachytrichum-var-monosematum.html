                    <h1>Rhododendron pachytrichum var. monosematum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron pachytrichum var. monosematum, commonly known as the single-leaved rhododendron, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically glabrous on both surfaces, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and well-drained acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
