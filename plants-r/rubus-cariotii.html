<p>Rubus cariotii, commonly known as the Cariot's blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are white with five petals.</p>
<p>The berries are edible, though they are often too tart for direct consumption without sweetening.</p>
