                    <h1>Roridula droserifolia</h1>
<p>Roridula droserifolia, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant belongs to the Roridulaceae family and is notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its flowers are small and typically pink or red, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous-like appearance, it is not a true carnivorous plant but relies on the trapped insects for nutrients.</p>
