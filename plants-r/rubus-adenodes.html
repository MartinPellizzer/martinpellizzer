<p>Rubus adenodes, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>

The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
