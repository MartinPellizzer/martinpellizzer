                    <h1>Rubus × pugionifer</h1>
<p>Rubus × pugionifer, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across surfaces. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Botanically, it is notable for its complex hybrid origin, often resulting from crosses between different Rubus species.</p>
<p>Its morphology and genetic diversity make it an interesting subject for botanical study and cultivation.</p>
