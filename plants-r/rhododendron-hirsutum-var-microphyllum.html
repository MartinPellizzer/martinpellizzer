<p>Rhododendron hirsutum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf hairy rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
