                    <h1>Rumex × hayekii</h1>
<p>Rumex × hayekii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leafed sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish coloration on the veins, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth habits and leaf characteristics compared to its parent species.</p>
