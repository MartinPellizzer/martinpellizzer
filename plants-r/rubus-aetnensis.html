                    <h1>Rubus aetnensis</h1>
<p>Rubus aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, red, edible fruits similar to raspberries. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of the volcano. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it flowers with white to pale pink blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.</p>
