<p>Ruppia maritima subsp.</p>
<p>spiralis, commonly known as spiral sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and brackish waters, often forming dense underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which distinguishes it from other Ruppia species. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by wind, and it produces floating seeds that aid in its dispersal.</p>
<p>This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
