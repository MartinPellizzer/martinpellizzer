                    <h1>Ruppia maritima var. recta</h1>
<p>Ruppia maritima var. recta, commonly known as the straight sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow coastal waters and brackish marshes, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its salty habitat. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like clusters, and it relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>This variety is important for stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
