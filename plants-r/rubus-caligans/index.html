                            <h1>Rubus Caligans</h1>
<p>Rubus caligans, also known as the alpine raspberry, is a hardy shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. This plant is characterized by its small, prickly leaves and clusters of tiny, edible fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine terrain. Despite its modest size, Rubus caligans plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and ecosystems. Its resilience and adaptability make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
