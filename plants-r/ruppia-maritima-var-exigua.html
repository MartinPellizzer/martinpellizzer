                    <h1>Ruppia maritima var. exigua</h1>
<p>Ruppia maritima var. exigua, commonly known as the dwarf seagrass, is a marine plant that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This variant is closely related to the common seagrass Ruppia maritima, but it exhibits distinct morphological differences. It forms dense underwater meadows that provide important habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to fluctuating salinity and temperature conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
