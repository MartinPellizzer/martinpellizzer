                <h1>Rhinanthus oligadenus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus oligadenus, commonly known as the lesser yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and meadows, where it forms dense clusters of yellow-orange flowers. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and are pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and declining populations, it is considered a priority species for conservation in certain regions.</p>
