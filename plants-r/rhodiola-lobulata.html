                    <h1>Rhodiola lobulata</h1>
<p>Rhodiola lobulata, commonly known as the alpine rose or mountain rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Rhodiola lobulata is well adapted to cold, arid environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p>
