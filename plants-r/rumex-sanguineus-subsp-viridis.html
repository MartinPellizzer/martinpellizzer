<p>Rumex sanguineus subsp.</p>
<p>viridis, commonly known as the green sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features alternate, broadly ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish tinge on the veins.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are borne on erect, branched stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content.</p>
