<p>Robinia pseudoacacia f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaf false acacia, is a striking variation of the honey locust tree.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is characterized by its dark purple to bronze foliage, which provides a dramatic visual contrast to its typical green leaves.

The tree is native to the southeastern United States but is widely cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscapes and gardens.</p>
