<p>Rumex atlanticus, commonly known as coastal sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the eastern coast of North America.</p>

The plant features upright, hairy stems and alternate, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces edible, sour-tasting leaves that have been used historically for food and medicine.</p>
