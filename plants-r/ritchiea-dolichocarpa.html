<p>Ritchiea dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-stemmed cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more conspicuous than the male ones. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
