                    <h1>Rubus decipiens</h1>
<p>Rubus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive raspberry, is a species of shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of eastern North America, particularly the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits, which resemble raspberries, are edible but often have a less intense flavor compared to true raspberries.</p>
<p>The plant's common name reflects its ability to mimic the appearance of more familiar raspberry species, leading to potential confusion in identification.</p>
