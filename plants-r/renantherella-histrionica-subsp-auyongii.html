<p>Renantherella histrionica subsp.</p>
<p>auyongii, commonly known as the Auyong's flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange inflorescences, which are highly ornamental and attract attention.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers are relatively short-lived but emit a strong, sweet fragrance, which aids in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
