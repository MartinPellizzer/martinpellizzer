<p>It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark that provides protection against extreme temperatures and drought. The plant has a shrub-like structure with small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters and attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
