<p>Rhytidophyllum exsertum subsp.</p>
<p>wrightianum, commonly known as Wright's desert lily, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often opening at night. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and unique member of the Aizoaceae family.</p>
