                    <h1>Robinsonella pilosissima</h1>
<p>Robinsonella pilosissima, commonly known as the silky sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage with a silky texture due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody capsules containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
