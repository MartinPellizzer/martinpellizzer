<p>Rubus × pseudoaviicola, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or loganberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus pectoralis (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parent species.

Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
