                    <h1>Rhipsalis cassytha var. rhodocarpa</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis cassytha var. rhodocarpa, commonly known as the red-berried mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds. Its leaves are alternate and have a waxy surface, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of South America and is often found in humid, tropical environments.</p>
