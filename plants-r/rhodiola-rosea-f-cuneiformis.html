                    <h1>Rhodiola rosea f. cuneiformis</h1>
<p>Rhodiola rosea f. cuneiformis, commonly known as the "Siberian人参" or "golden root," is a rare, cold-hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, red or yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Its roots are rich in adaptogenic compounds, making it a subject of interest in traditional medicine and modern herbal supplements.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
