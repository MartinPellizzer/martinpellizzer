<p>Rubus parviflorus f. bifarius, commonly known as the twin-flowered bramble, is a botanical variant of the common bramble.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-flowered inflorescences, which set it apart from typical Rubus species. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color.</p>
<p>The foliage is generally trifoliate, with serrated leaf margins, and the plant has a thorny stem structure typical of the Rubus genus.</p>
