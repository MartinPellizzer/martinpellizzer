                    <h1>Rumex × corfusus</h1>
<p>Rumex × corfusus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological traits. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and the plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth habits and leaf characteristics.</p>
