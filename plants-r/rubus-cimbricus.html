<p>Rubus cimbricus, commonly known as the sea raspberry, is a species of bramble native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to rocky or sandy shores. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, resembling raspberries in appearance. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in saline or coastal environments.</p>
<p>Rubus cimbricus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
