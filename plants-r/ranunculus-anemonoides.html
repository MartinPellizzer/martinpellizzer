                    <h1>Ranunculus anemonoides</h1>
<p>Ranunculus anemonoides, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of finely divided, glossy green leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in spring, and the plant spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
