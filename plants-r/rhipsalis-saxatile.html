                    <h1>Rhipsalis saxatile</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis saxatile, commonly known as the rock candelabra cactus, is a unique species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, upright stems that resemble a candelabra, often covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
