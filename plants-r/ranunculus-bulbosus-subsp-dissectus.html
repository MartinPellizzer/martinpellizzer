<p>Ranunculus bulbosus subsp.</p>
<p>dissectus, commonly known as the dissected buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its finely dissected foliage, which gives it a more refined appearance compared to other ranunculus species.</p>
