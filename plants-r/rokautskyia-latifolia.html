                    <h1>Rokautskyia latifolia</h1>
<p>Rokautskyia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rokautsky, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
