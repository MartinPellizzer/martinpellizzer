                    <h1>Rhamnus × blumeri</h1>
<p>Rhamnus × blumeri, commonly known as the hybrid European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, spherical berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
