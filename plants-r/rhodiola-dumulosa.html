                    <h1>Rhodiola dumulosa</h1>
<p>Rhodiola dumulosa, commonly known as the alpine rose or mountain rhodiola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with fleshy, often reddish stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in harsh environments, such as rocky soils and high altitudes, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Rhodiola dumulosa is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its benefits.</p>
