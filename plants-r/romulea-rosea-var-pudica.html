<p>Romulea rosea var. pudica, commonly known as the shy bellflower, is a striking bulbous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or red throat. The plant produces a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette near the ground. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers close at night or on cloudy days, giving it its "shy" characteristic.</p>
<p>This species thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
