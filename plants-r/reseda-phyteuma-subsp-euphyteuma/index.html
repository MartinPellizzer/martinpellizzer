<p>Red campion, scientifically known as Reseda phyteuma subsp. euphyteuma, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and distinctive yellow stamens, which make it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in alpine and rocky environments. Its delicate appearance belies its hardy nature, allowing it to flourish in challenging climates. Despite its beauty, Red campion is relatively rare and requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival.</p>
