                    <h1>Rafnia retusa</h1>
<p>Rafnia retusa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. Rafnia retusa is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used in woodworking and traditional crafts.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
