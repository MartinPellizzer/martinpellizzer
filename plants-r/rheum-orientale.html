                    <h1>Rheum orientale</h1>
<p>Rheum orientale, commonly known as the oriental rhubarb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, wavy, and often hairy leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of bright red, spade-shaped flowers in the spring, which are typically followed by elongated, reddish-brown fruits. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible and have a tart flavor, though they are often used in cooking and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Rheum orientale is also valued for its medicinal properties, including its use in treating digestive issues and as a source of medicinal compounds.</p>
