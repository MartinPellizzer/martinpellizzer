<p>Rubus adscitus subsp.</p>
<p>densipilus, commonly known as the dense-hairy blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
