<p>Ranunculus uliginosus, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing from late spring to early summer.

<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of these habitats.</p>
