                    <h1>Rubus × lyprocarpus</h1>
<p>Rubus × lyprocarpus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in plants.</p>
