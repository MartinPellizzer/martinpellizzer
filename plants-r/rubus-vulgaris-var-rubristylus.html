                    <h1>Rubus vulgaris var. rubristylus</h1>
<p>Rubus vulgaris var. rubristylus, commonly known as the red-styled blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and more robust than those of the standard Rubus vulgaris. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems that provide structural support. Its flowers are pink to white, and the fruit develops from the fertilized flower, ripening in late summer.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its flavor and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes.</p>
