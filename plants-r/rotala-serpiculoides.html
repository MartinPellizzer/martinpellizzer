<p>Rotala serpiculoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it float on water surfaces. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value in ponds and water gardens. It thrives in warm, shallow waters with moderate to high light exposure.</p>
<p>Rotala serpiculoides is often used in aquascaping due to its dense growth habit and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
