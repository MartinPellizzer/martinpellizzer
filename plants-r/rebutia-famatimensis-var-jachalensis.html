                    <h1>Rebutia famatimensis var. jachalensis</h1>
<p>Rebutia famatimensis var. jachalensis, commonly known as the Jachal Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem that is typically ribbed and covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs.</p>
