<p>Rumex aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the volcanic regions of Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red-veined leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine environments. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine, though they contain oxalic acid.</p>
<p>The species is also of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude habitats.</p>
