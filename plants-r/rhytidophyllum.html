                    <h1>Rhytidophyllum</h1>
<p>Rhytidophyllum, commonly known as the peeling bark plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's foliage consists of elongated, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. Rhytidophyllum is a climbing shrub that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, using its aerial roots to attach to trees and other structures.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research.</p>
