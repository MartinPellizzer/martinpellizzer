                    <h1>Robinia pseudoacacia f. unifoliata</h1>
<p>Robinia pseudoacacia f. unifoliata, commonly known as the single-leaf false acacia, is a variant of the honey locust tree characterized by its reduced foliage.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a unique leaf structure, with each leaf reduced to a single, elongated leaflet instead of the typical compound leaves. It retains the robust, thorny appearance of the parent species, with bipinnate branches and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation, offering insights into genetic diversity within the Robinia genus.</p>
