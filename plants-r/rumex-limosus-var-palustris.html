<p>Rumex limosus var. palustris, commonly known as swamp sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are typically submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moist environments, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
