<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Reichardia sarmentosa is often found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through runners, making it both a common and sometimes invasive species in certain habitats.</p>
