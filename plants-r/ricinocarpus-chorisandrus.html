<p>Ricinocarpus chorisandrus, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits that contain flat, leathery seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
