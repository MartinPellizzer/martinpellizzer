                    <h1>Rhus dentata</h1>
<p>Rhus dentata, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that mature in the fall. Its bark is thick and rough, often appearing fibrous and resembling the antlers of a stag, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Rhus dentata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, streambanks, and disturbed sites.</p>
