<p>Roldana gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's roldana, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and branching.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Roldana gentryi is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
