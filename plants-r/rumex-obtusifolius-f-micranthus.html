                    <h1>Rumex obtusifolius f. micranthus</h1>
<p>Rumex obtusifolius f. micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
