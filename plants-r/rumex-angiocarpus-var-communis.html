                    <h1>Rumex angiocarpus var. communis</h1>
<p>Rumex angiocarpus var. communis, commonly known as sour dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, wavy, and often reddish leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high concentration of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity.</p>
