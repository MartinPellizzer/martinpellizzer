<p>Rhus truncata, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its bark is thick and rough, with a distinctive, rugged texture that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Rhus truncata is often found in dry, open woodlands and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
