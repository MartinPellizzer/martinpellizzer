<p>Ranunculus aquatilis subsp.</p>
<p>circinatus, commonly known as the spiral water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant features finely divided, spirally arranged leaves that help it float and capture sunlight efficiently. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces aquatic fruits that disperse by water.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
