                    <h1>Rhodiola chrysanthemifolia subsp. liciae</h1>
<p>Rhodiola chrysanthemifolia subsp.</p>
<p>liciae, commonly known as the alpine rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with fleshy, often reddish stems and small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to orange in color.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically in rocky or alpine meadows, where it tolerates cold and low-nutrient soils. Its leaves are typically basal, alternate, and have a succulent texture, which helps it conserve water in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its adaptability to extreme climates and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
