<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>almquistii, commonly known as the Almqvist's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features bright yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, which are often adorned with a distinctive white or pale green border. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to the typical *R. auricomus*.</p>
