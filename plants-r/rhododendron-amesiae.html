                    <h1>Rhododendron amesiae</h1>
<p>Rhododendron amesiae, commonly known as the Amesia rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leathery leaves, which help it adapt to its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
