                    <h1>Rumex persicaria</h1>
<p>Rumex persicaria, commonly known as common knotgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a prominently veined underside and produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes. Its reproductive structures are monoecious, meaning both male and female flowers are present on the same plant.</p>
<p>The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source for livestock.</p>
