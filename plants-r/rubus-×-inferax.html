                    <h1>Rubus × inferax</h1>
<p>Rubus × inferax, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is both a useful food source and a challenging weed in agricultural settings.</p>
