                    <h1>Retama raetam var. pallens</h1>
<p>Retama raetam var. pallens, commonly known as the pale retama, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, with woody stems that can persist for several years.</p>
<p>The pale retama plays a role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid regions and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
