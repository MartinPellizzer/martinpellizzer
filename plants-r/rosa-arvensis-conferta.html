<p>Rosa arvensis conferta, commonly known as the dense field rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces oval, green leaves with serrated edges, and its fruit is a red, hairy rosehip that contains the seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>The dense growth habit of this species makes it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
