<p>Rhabdophyllum affine subsp.</p>
<p>pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered rhabdophyllum, is a rare and specialized member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces few, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
