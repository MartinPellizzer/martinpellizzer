                    <h1>Roscyna gmelinii</h1>
<p>Roscyna gmelinii, commonly known as the coastal roscyna, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Roscyna gmelinii plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
