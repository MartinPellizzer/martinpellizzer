                    <h1>Rosa communis subvar. fastigiata</h1>
<p>Rosa communis subvar. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright or columnar rose, is a compact, shrub-like rose with a unique, narrow growth habit.</p>
<p>It features tightly packed, dark green foliage and produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. This variety is well-suited for small spaces due to its upright form and minimal lateral branching. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively disease-resistant and suitable for both garden borders and container planting.</p>
