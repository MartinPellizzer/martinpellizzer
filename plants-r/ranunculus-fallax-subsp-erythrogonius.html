<p>Ranunculus fallax subsp.</p>
<p>erythrogonius, commonly known as the red-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellow flowers with prominent, red-tinged sepals.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but is considered rare in the wild.</p>
