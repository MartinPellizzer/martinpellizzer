                    <h1>Rumex × castrensis</h1>
<p>Rumex × castrensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its hybrid nature makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and ecological research.</p>
