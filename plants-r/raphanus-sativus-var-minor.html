<p>Raphanus sativus var. minor, commonly known as the field radish, is a small, annual Brassicaceae plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features a taproot that is typically white or light yellow, with a mild, spicy flavor. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes, and its leaves are pinnately divided with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in cool climates and is often cultivated as a leafy vegetable or for its edible roots.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common radish (Raphanus sativus) but is smaller in size and has a shorter growing season.</p>
