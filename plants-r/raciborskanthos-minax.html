<p>Raciborskanthos minax, commonly known as the rare Himalayan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Raciborskanthos minax is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
