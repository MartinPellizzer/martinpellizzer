<p>Rumex scutatus subsp.</p>
<p>induratus, commonly known as the rough dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed, and often hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broad, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating, which reduces water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields.</p>
