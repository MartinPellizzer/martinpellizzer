                    <h1>Rhytiglossa obtusifolia var. hirsuticaulis</h1>
<p>Rhytiglossa obtusifolia var. hirsuticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed pincushion cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems covered in short, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival during dry periods.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
