<p>Rubus gulosus, commonly known as the greedy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically red or yellow when mature. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas.</p>
<p>The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and wines.</p>
