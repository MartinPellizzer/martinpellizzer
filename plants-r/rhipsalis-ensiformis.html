<p>Rhipsalis ensiformis, commonly known as the sword cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender, leaf-like stems that are typically green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the winter months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis ensiformis is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
