                    <h1>Rubus pubescens var. contectus</h1>
<p>Rubus pubescens var. contectus, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a thorny shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, thriving in partial to full sunlight. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, aggregate fruits that mature to a reddish-black color. Its stems are covered in dense, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Rubus species and is often found growing in association with other brambles in its native habitat.</p>
