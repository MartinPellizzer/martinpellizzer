                <h1>Rhodiola rosea</h1>
<p>Rhodiola rosea, commonly known as the golden root, is a perennial plant native to cold climates of the Arctic, alpine regions, and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, rhizomatous root system and small, pink or red flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme environmental conditions, including frost and high altitudes. Its medicinal properties are attributed to the presence of secondary metabolites such as rosavins and salidrosides.</p>
<p>Rhodiola rosea is widely used in traditional medicine for its adaptogenic and antioxidant effects.</p>
