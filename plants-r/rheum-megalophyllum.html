                    <h1>Rheum megalophyllum</h1>
<p>Rheum megalophyllum, commonly known as the giant rhubarb, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, making it one of the largest leafy plants in the genus Rheum. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, red berries. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible but typically not consumed due to their high acidity.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
