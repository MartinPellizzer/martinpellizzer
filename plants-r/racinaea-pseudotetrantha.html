<p>Racinaea pseudotetrantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
