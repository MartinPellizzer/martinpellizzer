                    <h1>Rosa pendulina var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Rosa pendulina var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent climbing rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching stems that can climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense, sprawling growth. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, red-orange hips. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its cascading habit and showy blooms.</p>
