<p>Ruprechtia apurensis, commonly known as the Apure river fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America, particularly Venezuela.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater environments such as rivers and streams, where it thrives in shallow, fast-flowing waters. The plant has long, slender fronds that are usually submerged, with delicate, lance-shaped leaves. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and water pollution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
