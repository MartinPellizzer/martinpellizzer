<p>Roegneria pubicaulis, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy leaf blades that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Roegneria pubicaulis is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects.</p>
