<p>Rubus obtruncatus subsp.</p>
<p>mutabilis, commonly known as the variable blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of edible, dark purple to black berries.</p>
<p>The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its variable morphology, it can be challenging to distinguish from other Rubus species in the wild.</p>
