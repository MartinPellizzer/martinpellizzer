<p>Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa, it is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. It is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
