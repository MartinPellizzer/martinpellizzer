<p>Rubus leucophaeus f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate white-haired raspberry, is a botanical variant of the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white to pale pink flowers and its intermediate traits between the typical Rubus leucophaeus and other related species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many Rubus species. It produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are often red or yellow when mature.</p>
