                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. pardalinus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. pardalinus, commonly known as the spotted castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a striking pattern of red, purple, or brown spots. This cultivar is primarily grown for its ornamental value rather than for oil production. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>The plant is toxic due to the presence of ricin in its seeds, so caution is necessary when handling it.</p>
