<p>Robynsiophyton vanderystii, commonly known as the Vanderyst's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant exhibits a sympodial growth habit, with short, creeping rhizomes and a few erect stems. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with three sepals and three petals, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
