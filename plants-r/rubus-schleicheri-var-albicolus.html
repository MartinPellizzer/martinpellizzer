<p>Rubus schleicheri var. albicolus, commonly known as the white-flowered bramble, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub, with thorny stems and serrated leaves. Its fruits, though not widely cultivated, are edible and similar in taste to other Rubus species.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral coloration and potential ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
