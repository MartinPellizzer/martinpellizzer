                    <h1>Rottboellia salsa</h1>
<p>Rottboellia salsa, commonly known as the desert grass or Mexican grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Rottboellia salsa is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, making it a resilient species in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological restoration projects in dryland ecosystems.</p>
