                    <h1>Roegneria sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Roegneria sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving them a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Roegneria sclerophylla is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and as a forage species in arid regions.</p>
