<p>Rhyticalymma, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in the spring. Rhyticalymma has a woody stem and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its leaves contain essential oils that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties.</p>
