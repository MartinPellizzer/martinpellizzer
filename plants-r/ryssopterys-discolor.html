<p>Ryssopterys discolor, commonly known as the variegated fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that display a striking pattern of green and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>Ryssopterys discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties.</p>
