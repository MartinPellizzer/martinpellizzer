<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>exiguifrons, commonly known as the narrow-fruited buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often with a distinctive white or greenish central marking.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more compact flower structure compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus.</p>
