                    <h1>Rupicola</h1>
<p>Rupicola, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. Rupicola species are typically small, shrub-like cacti with spiny stems and clusters of small, colorful flowers. They are well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ability to store water make them well-suited for survival in extreme conditions.</p>
