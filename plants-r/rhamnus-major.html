<p>Rhamnus major, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 2â€“4 meters and features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are a food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and gray, with prominent lenticels, and it is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Rhamnus major is also known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
