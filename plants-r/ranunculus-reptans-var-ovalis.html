                    <h1>Ranunculus reptans var. ovalis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus reptans var. ovalis, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it both a common weed and a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators.</p>
