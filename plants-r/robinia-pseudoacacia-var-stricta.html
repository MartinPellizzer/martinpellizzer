                    <h1>Robinia pseudoacacia var. stricta</h1>
<p>Robinia pseudoacacia var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf false acacia, is a variant of the honeylocust tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in reforestation projects.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the standard Robinia pseudoacacia, making it suitable for smaller landscapes.</p>
