<p>Richteria sussamyrensis, commonly known as the Sussamyren mountain bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its flowers bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Richteria sussamyrensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
