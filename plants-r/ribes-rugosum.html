<p>Ribes rugosum, commonly known as the rough gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, thorny stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by berries that mature to a dark red or purple color. These berries are edible and often used in jams and pies, though they can be tart.</p>
<p>Ribes rugosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators.</p>
