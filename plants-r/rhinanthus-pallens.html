<p>Rhinanthus pallens, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is an annual plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, often in meadows and grasslands. Its flowers have five petals and are arranged in a spike-like cluster.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus pallens plays an important role in promoting biodiversity by stimulating the growth of grasses and other plants through its parasitic relationship.</p>
