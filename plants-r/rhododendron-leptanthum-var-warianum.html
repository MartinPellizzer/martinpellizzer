<p>Rhododendron leptanthum var. warianum, commonly known as the Wari√°n rhododendron, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within evergreen forests, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, providing a dense canopy that supports a variety of epiphytic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
