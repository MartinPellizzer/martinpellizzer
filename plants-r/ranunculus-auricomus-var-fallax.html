                    <h1>Ranunculus auricomus var. fallax</h1>
<p>Ranunculus auricomus var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax buttercup, is a variant of the auricomus buttercup, characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with large, white-petaled centers.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
