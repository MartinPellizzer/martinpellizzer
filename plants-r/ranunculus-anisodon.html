<p>Ranunculus anisodon, commonly known as the spiked buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and bright yellow flowers that have five to seven petals. The plant produces a cluster of small, greenish-brown achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Ranunculus anisodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms.</p>
