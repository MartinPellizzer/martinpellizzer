<p>Rumex orientalis, commonly known as oriental sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tinge and a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it both a useful edible plant and an ornamental species in gardens.</p>
