                    <h1>Ricinus communis var. armatus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis var. armatus, commonly known as the armed castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive spiny seed pods.</p>
<p>This plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. The leaves are large, palmate, and often have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and robust. The spines on the seed pods serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>It is important to note that all parts of this plant contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals.</p>
