<p>Rubus fagifolius, commonly known as the hazelnut blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, with the central leaflet often resembling a hazelnut leaf. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to blackberries but have a more delicate flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
