                    <h1>Rhododendron keiskei var. cordifolium</h1>
<p>Rhododendron keiskei var. cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved snowbell, is a rare and striking plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring. The leaves are broadly ovate and heart-shaped, giving the plant its common name, and are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
