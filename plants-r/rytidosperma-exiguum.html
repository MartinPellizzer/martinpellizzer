                    <h1>Rytidosperma exiguum</h1>
<p>Rytidosperma exiguum, commonly known as the slender spinifex grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It has narrow, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Rytidosperma exiguum is well adapted to drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem.</p>
