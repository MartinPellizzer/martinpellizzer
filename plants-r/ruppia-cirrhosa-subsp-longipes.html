<p>Ruppia cirrhosa subsp.</p>
<p>longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to brackish and saline environments. It typically grows in coastal areas, estuaries, and shallow waters, where it thrives in the intertidal zone.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
