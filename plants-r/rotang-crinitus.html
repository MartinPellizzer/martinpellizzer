                    <h1>Rotang crinitus</h1>
<p>Rotang crinitus, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hairy texture on the bark and leaves, which helps in reducing water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in brackish water and tidal zones, playing a crucial role in coastal ecosystems. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes soil and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is valued for its durable timber, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture making.</p>
