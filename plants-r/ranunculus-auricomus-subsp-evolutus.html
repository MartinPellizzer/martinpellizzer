<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>evolutus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5â€“15 petals, which bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest clearings.</p>
<p>The subspecies evolutus is distinguished by its more elongated and slightly curled petals compared to the typical form of R. auricomus.</p>
