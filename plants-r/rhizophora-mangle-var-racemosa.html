                    <h1>Rhizophora mangle var. racemosa</h1>
<p>Rhizophora mangle var. racemosa, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree adapted to thrive in saline coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prop roots, which provide structural support and aid in oxygen uptake in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fruit is a capsule containing numerous buoyant seeds, facilitating dispersal by water.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse coastal ecosystems.</p>
