<p>Rebutia cincinnata, commonly known as the cushion euphorbia, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded shape with dense clusters of small, fleshy stems that form a cushion-like appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are typically small, rounded, and covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs.</p>
<p>Rebutia cincinnata is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and requiring minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
