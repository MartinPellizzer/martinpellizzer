<p>Rhamnus integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are entire, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it has a tendency to form dense thickets in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Rhamnus integrifolia is often found in moist, shady areas such as forest understories and along streambanks.</p>
