<p>Rosa quasismolandica, commonly known as the Quasismolandic rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clustered, semi-evergreen foliage and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“2 meters and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils with partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features include pinnately compound leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
