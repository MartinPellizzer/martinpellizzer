<p>Rubus silurum, commonly known as Silurian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in woodland and hedgerow environments, often thriving in moist, shaded conditions. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but have a somewhat tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in stiff, prickly hairs.</p>
<p>Rubus silurum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds.</p>
