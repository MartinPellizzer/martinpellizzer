<p>Restrepia crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed restrepia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulbous structure with broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its high-altitude, often arid environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, white to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in cool, humid conditions with partial shade, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
