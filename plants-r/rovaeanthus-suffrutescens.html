<p>Rovaeanthus suffrutescens, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy white seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
