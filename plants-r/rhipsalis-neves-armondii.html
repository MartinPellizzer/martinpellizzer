<p>Rhipsalis neves-armondii, commonly known as the Neves Armondii mistletoe cactus, is a rare epiphytic cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas of the Atlantic Forest.</p>
