                    <h1>Rumex × carinthiacus</h1>
<p>Rumex × carinthiacus, commonly known as the Carpathian sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (bitter sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color and have a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
