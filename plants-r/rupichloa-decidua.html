                    <h1>Rupichloa decidua</h1>
<p>Rupichloa decidua, commonly known as the desert feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and typically shed during periods of extreme drought, a characteristic that aids in water conservation.</p>
<p>Rupichloa decidua plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
