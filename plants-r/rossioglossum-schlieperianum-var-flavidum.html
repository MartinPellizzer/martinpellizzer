                    <h1>Rossioglossum schlieperianum var. flavidum</h1>
<p>Rossioglossum schlieperianum var. flavidum, commonly known as the golden-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow floral bracts and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in dense, moist vegetation near water bodies, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
