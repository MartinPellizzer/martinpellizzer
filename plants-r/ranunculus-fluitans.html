                    <h1>Ranunculus fluitans</h1>
<p>Ranunculus fluitans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a water-dwelling plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and bright green, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers, which resemble those of the common buttercup, bloom from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Ranunculus fluitans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
