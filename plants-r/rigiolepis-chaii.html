                    <h1>Rigiolepis chaii</h1>
<p>Rigiolepis chaii, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive bell-shaped flower structure, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rigiolepis chaii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
