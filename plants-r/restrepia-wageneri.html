<p>Restrepia wageneri, commonly known as the Wagener's lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms during the dry season.</p>
<p>Its habitat is highly specific, requiring cool, humid conditions with high levels of shade, making it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
