                    <h1>Rosa canina f. pseudodiscolor</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. pseudodiscolor, commonly known as the pale form of dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to almost white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or pink blooms of the standard Rosa canina. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and pinnate leaves, typical of the Rosaceae family. Its flowers are usually borne in clusters and have a sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>This form is less common in cultivation but is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in herbal medicine.</p>
