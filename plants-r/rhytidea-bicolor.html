<p>Rhytidea bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaves that display two different colors, typically a darker green on one side and a lighter green on the other. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a finely divided appearance.</p>
<p>Rhytidea bicolor thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical rainforests.</p>
