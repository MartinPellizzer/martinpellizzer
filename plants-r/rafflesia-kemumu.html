                    <h1>Rafflesia kemumu</h1>
<p>Rafflesia kemumu, commonly known as the "smelly lady," is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is renowned for producing one of the largest individual flowers in the world, with a diameter that can reach up to 1 meter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Rafflesia kemumu lies in its unique evolutionary adaptations and its role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
