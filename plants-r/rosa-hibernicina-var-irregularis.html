                    <h1>Rosa hibernicina var. irregularis</h1>
<p>Rosa hibernicina var. irregularis, commonly known as the Irish rose or the mountain rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the high-altitude regions of the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, arching stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with finely serrated margins, and the plant produces hips that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
