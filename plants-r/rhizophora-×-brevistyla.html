                    <h1>Rhizophora × brevistyla</h1>
<p>Rhizophora × brevistyla, commonly known as the red mangrove hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rhizophora mangle and Rhizophora stylosa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that extend from its trunk into the water, providing structural support in tidal environments. The plant thrives in brackish water habitats, such as estuaries and coastal wetlands, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, red berries that contain buoyant seeds.</p>
<p>This species is an important component of mangrove ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and coastal protection.</p>
