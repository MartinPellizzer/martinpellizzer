                    <h1>Rosettea castroi</h1>
<p>Rosettea castroi, commonly known as the Castroi's rosette, is a striking plant characterized by its dense, compact rosette structure.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically emerging from the center of the rosette. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
