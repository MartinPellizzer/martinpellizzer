<p>Ranunculus auricomus var. sylvicola, commonly known as the forest buttercup, is a variant of the yellow buttercup characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with a distinctive auricle-like leaf structure.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly found in forested areas and moist meadows. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, with trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
