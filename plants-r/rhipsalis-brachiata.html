                    <h1>Rhipsalis brachiata</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis brachiata, commonly known as the mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that serve as photosynthetic structures. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its stems are typically long and trailing, allowing it to grow along tree branches or in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis brachiata is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires high humidity to thrive.</p>
