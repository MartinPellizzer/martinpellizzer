<p>Rhinanthus angustifolius subsp.</p>
<p>subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine narrow-leaved tickseed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species. It typically thrives in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant in many parts of its range.</p>
