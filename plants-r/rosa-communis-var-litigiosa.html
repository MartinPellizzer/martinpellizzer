                    <h1>Rosa communis var. litigiosa</h1>
<p>Rosa communis var. litigiosa, commonly known as the battle rose, is a less commonly cultivated variety of the common rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep crimson petals and thorny stems, which are typical of many rose species. This variety is often found in wild settings, particularly in temperate regions with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include compound leaves and a strong, aromatic fragrance.</p>
<p>While not as popular in gardens as other roses, it holds historical significance in certain cultural contexts.</p>
