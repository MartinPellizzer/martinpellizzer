<p>Rumex patientia var. callosus, commonly known as the rough dock, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
