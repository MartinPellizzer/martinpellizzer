                    <h1>Ranunculus praemorsus var. amellus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus praemorsus var. amellus, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to other ranunculus species.</p>
