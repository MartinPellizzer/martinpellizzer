                    <h1>Rhododendron × gladwynense</h1>
<p>Rhododendron × gladwynense, commonly known as Gladwyn's rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is evergreen, with thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying hybridization in the Rhododendron genus.</p>
