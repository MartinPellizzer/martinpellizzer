<p>Rhipidorchis, commonly known as the fairyå…°, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often resemble miniature orchids. Rhipidorchis species typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and thrive in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. They are often found in shaded or partially shaded environments, and their growth is associated with specific soil conditions and moisture levels.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, many species of Rhipidorchis are considered rare or endangered.</p>
