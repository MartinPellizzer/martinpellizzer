                    <h1>Robinia pseudoacacia f. amorphifolia</h1>
<p>Robinia pseudoacacia f. amorphifolia, commonly known as the woolly false acacia, is a rare variant of the honeylocust tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its highly variable, often lobed leaves that are covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it grows in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clustered spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The foliage and bark contain toxic compounds, making it less desirable for ornamental use in some regions.</p>
