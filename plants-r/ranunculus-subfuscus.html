<p>Ranunculus subfuscus, commonly known as the dark-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a dark green to almost black coloration, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
