<p>Ranunculus nivicola, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a small flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Ranunculus nivicola is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and snow patches during the brief summer season.</p>
