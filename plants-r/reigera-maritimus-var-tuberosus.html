                    <h1>Reigera maritimus var. tuberosus</h1>
<p>Reigera maritimus var. tuberosus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant characterized by its distinctive, spiky blue or purple flowers and silver-blue foliage.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along the shores of the Mediterranean and other coastal regions. The plant produces tuberous roots that store nutrients, aiding its survival in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are often arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, making it a striking ornamental plant in coastal gardens.</p>
