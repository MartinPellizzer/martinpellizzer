                    <h1>Rumex × scandicus</h1>
<p>Rumex × scandicus, commonly known as the common sorrel, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetobatus.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a distinctive heart-shaped leaf that is often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, nitrogen-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit variability in its morphology and growth habits.</p>
