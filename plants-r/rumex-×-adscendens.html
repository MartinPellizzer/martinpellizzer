                    <h1>Rumex × adscendens</h1>
<p>Rumex × adscendens, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broad-leaved sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological features. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a serrated margin and a red or purple coloration on the veins. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its edible leaves, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content.</p>
