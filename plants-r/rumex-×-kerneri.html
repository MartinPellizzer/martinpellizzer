                    <h1>Rumex × kerneri</h1>
<p>Rumex × kerneri, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leafed sorrel). The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that have a distinctive sour taste due to high concentrations of oxalic acid. Its flowers are small and clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its edible leaves, though caution is advised due to its potential to cause digestive irritation.</p>
