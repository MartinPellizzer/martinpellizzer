                    <h1>Rhodiola tuberosa</h1>
<p>Rhodiola tuberosa, commonly known as the Siberian rhododendron, is a perennial plant native to the cold regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in alpine and arctic environments, where it adapts to harsh conditions through its ability to store nutrients in its roots. Its leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, allowing it to photosynthesize efficiently even in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Rhodiola tuberosa is also noted for its resilience to extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky or barren soils.</p>
