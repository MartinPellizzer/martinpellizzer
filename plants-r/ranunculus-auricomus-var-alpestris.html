                    <h1>Ranunculus auricomus var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Ranunculus auricomus var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that resemble a crown, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and preference for cool climates, it is considered a characteristic species of alpine ecosystems.</p>
