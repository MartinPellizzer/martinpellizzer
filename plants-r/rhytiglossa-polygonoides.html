                    <h1>Rhytiglossa polygonoides</h1>
<p>Rhytiglossa polygonoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, and it lacks true leaves, instead relying on its stems for photosynthesis. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ethereal appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
