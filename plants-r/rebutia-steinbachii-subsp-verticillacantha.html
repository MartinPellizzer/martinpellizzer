<p>Rebutia steinbachii subsp.</p>
<p>verticillacantha, commonly known as the rock cactus or sun cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in dense, white to pale blue spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
