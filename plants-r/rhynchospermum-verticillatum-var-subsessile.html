<p>Rhynchospermum verticillatum var. subsessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhynchospermum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The varietal form subsessile is distinguished by its shorter stem compared to the typical form.</p>
