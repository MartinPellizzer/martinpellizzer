                    <h1>Raphanus fugax</h1>
<p>Raphanus fugax, commonly known as the transient radish, is a short-lived plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth cycle, often completing its life cycle within a single growing season. The plant typically features a rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its ephemeral nature.</p>
<p>Due to its brief lifespan and adaptability, Raphanus fugax is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
