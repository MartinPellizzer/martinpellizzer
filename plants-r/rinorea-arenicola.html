<p>Rinorea arenicola, commonly known as the sandrinorea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Rinorea arenicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
