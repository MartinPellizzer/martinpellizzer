<p>Rhaphidospora membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, membranous fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
