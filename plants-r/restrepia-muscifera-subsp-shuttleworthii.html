<p>Restrepia muscifera subsp.</p>
<p>shuttleworthii, commonly known as the Shuttleworth's orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. It is particularly sensitive to temperature fluctuations and benefits from consistent moisture without waterlogging.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
