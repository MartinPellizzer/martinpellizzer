                    <h1>Rolliniopsis</h1>
<p>Rolliniopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Rolliniopsis thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
