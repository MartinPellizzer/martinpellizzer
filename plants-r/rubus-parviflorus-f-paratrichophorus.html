                    <h1>Rubus parviflorus f. paratrichophorus</h1>
<p>Rubus parviflorus f. paratrichophorus, commonly known as the pale-flowered blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, pale pink to white flowers, which distinguish it from the more typical red or pink blooms of other Rubus species. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the plant produces small, dark purple to black berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and genetic variation.</p>
