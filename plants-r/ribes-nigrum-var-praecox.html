                    <h1>Ribes nigrum var. praecox</h1>
<p>Ribes nigrum var. praecox, commonly known as early blackcurrant, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, dark purple to black berries that ripen earlier than the typical blackcurrant variety. The plant has alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.</p>
<p>The berries are not only edible but also serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
