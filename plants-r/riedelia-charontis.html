                    <h1>Riedelia charontis</h1>
<p>Riedelia charontis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in wetlands or swampy areas. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique growth habit and limited distribution make it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Riedelia charontis is critically endangered in the wild.</p>
