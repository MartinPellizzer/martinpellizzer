                    <h1>Rohdea emeiensis</h1>
<p>Rohdea emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei mountain sword fern, is a rare and striking member of the Thelypteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with a dense rosette of lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited propagation, it is considered endangered and requires careful preservation efforts.</p>
