                    <h1>Rumex × exsul</h1>
<p>Rumex × exsul, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex patientia (lamb's tongue).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on tall, erect stems. Rumex × exsul thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its foliage is edible but contains oxalic acid, so it should be consumed in moderation.</p>
