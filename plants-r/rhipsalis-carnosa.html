<p>Rhipsalis carnosa, commonly known as the silver needle cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, thin, and often branched stems that resemble strings or needles, which are covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters during the winter months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it does not have true leaves or roots.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis carnosa is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
