<p>Rhinanthus pubescens grex pindicus, commonly known as the Pindus yellow rattle, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are usually arranged in spikes and bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The species is named after the Pindus mountain range in Greece, where it is native.</p>
