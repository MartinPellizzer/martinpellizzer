                    <h1>Rhinanthus capensis</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus capensis, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic relationships with grasses. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots form haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants, allowing it to draw nutrients.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus capensis plays a role in promoting biodiversity by encouraging the growth of grasses through its parasitic behavior.</p>
