                    <h1>Rosa minimalis</h1>
<p>Rosa minimalis, commonly known as the minimal rose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, simple flowers that bloom in shades of pale pink and white, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has slender, thornless stems and small, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rosa minimalis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
