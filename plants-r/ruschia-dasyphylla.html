                    <h1>Ruschia dasyphylla</h1>
<p>Ruschia dasyphylla, commonly known as the woolly ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or grayish hairs on its leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid climates.</p>
