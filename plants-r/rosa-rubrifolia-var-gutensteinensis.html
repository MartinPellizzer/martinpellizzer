<p>Rosa rubrifolia var. gutensteinensis, commonly known as the Gutenstein rose, is a rare and distinctive variant of the rubrifolia species.</p>

This plant is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
