<p>Rhinanthus alectorolophus subsp.</p>
<p>facchinii, commonly known as the Southern Marsh Orchid, is a herbaceous flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
