<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its ecosystem.</p>
