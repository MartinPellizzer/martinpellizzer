                    <h1>Ritchiea littoralis</h1>
<p>Ritchiea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a unique plant species native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes or near the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ritchiea littoralis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
