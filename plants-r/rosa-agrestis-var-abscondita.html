The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Its foliage is dark green and velvety, with thorny stems that provide structural support.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for conservationists.</p>
