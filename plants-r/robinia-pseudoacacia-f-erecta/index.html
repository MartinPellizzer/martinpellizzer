<p>Black locust, scientifically known as Robinia pseudoacacia f. erecta, is a striking tree native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its rapid growth, strong wood, and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The tree's dark, fissured bark and fragrant yellow flowers make it a notable ornamental species. Despite its beauty, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range. Its ecological impact and historical uses continue to spark both admiration and concern.</p>
