                    <h1>Rosa arvensis var. umbellata</h1>
<p>Rosa arvensis var. umbellata, commonly known as the common dog玫瑰, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of many rose species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that are often covered in a fine layer of down.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth.</p>
