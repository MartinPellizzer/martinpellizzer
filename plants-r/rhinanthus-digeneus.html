                <h1>Rhinanthus digeneus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus digeneus, commonly known as the two-seeded tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its small, two-lobed seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across different environments.</p>
