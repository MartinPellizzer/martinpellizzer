                    <h1>Rosa gymnocarpa var. serpentina</h1>
<p>Rosa gymnocarpa var. serpentina, commonly known as the naked-seed rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and small, pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that are covered in a thin, smooth layer rather than the typical hairy covering found in many rose species. Its leaves are alternate, pinnate, and have a leathery texture, adapting to the harsh alpine environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
