                    <h1>Rubus lacustris</h1>
<p>Rubus lacustris, commonly known as the lake raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically alternate and serrated. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in moist, acidic soils near lakes and wetlands, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is often used as an indicator species for wetland health.</p>
