<p>Rhizophora mucronata, commonly known as the mangrove rivierella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pneumatophores, which are specialized aerial roots that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. This plant thrives in coastal areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
