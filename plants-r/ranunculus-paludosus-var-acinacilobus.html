                    <h1>Ranunculus paludosus var. acinacilobus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus paludosus var. acinacilobus, commonly known as the marsh buttercup variant with sickle-shaped lobes, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, dark green leaves that are often described as having a sickle-like appearance due to their lobed structure. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health and is sometimes protected in conservation efforts.</p>
