                    <h1>Rhagodia ulicina</h1>
<p>Rhagodia ulicina, commonly known as the Narrow-leafed Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline and nutrient-poor soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>Rhagodia ulicina is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
