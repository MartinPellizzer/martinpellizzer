<p>Rubus pervagus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread across ground surfaces. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often tart in flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges.</p>
<p>Rubus pervagus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food for birds and insects.</p>
