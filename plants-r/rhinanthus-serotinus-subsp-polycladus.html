<p>Rhinanthus serotinus subsp.</p>
<p>polycladus, commonly known as the late yellow-rattle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects genetic and morphological differences from the main species, Rhinanthus serotinus.</p>
