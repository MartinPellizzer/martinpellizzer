                    <h1>Rumex acetosella var. lancifolius</h1>
<p>Rumex acetosella var. lancifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel plant.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. The leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a sour, tangy taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
