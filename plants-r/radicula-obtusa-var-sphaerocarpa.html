<p>Radicula obtusa var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the spherical radicula, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive spherical fruiting bodies.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Podostomaceae and is typically found in freshwater habitats, such as slow-moving streams and riverbanks. The plant exhibits a specialized morphology, with its fruiting bodies resembling small, rounded structures that float on the water surface. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for aquatic ecosystems and its unique reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
