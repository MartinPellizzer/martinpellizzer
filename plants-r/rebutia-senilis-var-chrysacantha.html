                    <h1>Rebutia senilis var. chrysacantha</h1>
<p>Rebutia senilis var. chrysacantha, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive golden-yellow coloration, especially on the upper parts. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
