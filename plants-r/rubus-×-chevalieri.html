                    <h1>Rubus × chevalieri</h1>
<p>Rubus × chevalieri, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub that belongs to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parent species. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a firm texture and a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between two economically important fruit species.</p>
