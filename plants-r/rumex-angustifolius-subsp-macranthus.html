<p>Rumex angustifolius subsp.</p>
<p>macranthus, commonly known as narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter tall, bearing alternate, lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters at the tips of the stems, which are characteristic of the Polygonaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable in some cultures.</p>
