                    <h1>Rockhausenia cochlearis</h1>
<p>Rockhausenia cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is known for its intricate, spiral-shaped thallus structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its ability to thrive in rocky and shaded environments. It is typically found on calcareous substrates, such as limestone, where it plays a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Rockhausenia cochlearis is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
