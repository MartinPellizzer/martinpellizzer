                            <h1>Rhododendron Selense Subsp. Setiferum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron selense subsp. setiferum is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is known for its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Its unique foliage and floral structure make it a prized addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered, highlighting the need for preservation and study.</p>
