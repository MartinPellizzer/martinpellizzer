                    <h1>Rhododendron melantherum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron melantherum, commonly known as the black-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its showy, pink to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations, often in mountain forests. Its leaves are leathery and densely packed, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
