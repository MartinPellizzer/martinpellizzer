                    <h1>Rubus stenothyrsus</h1>
<p>Rubus stenothyrsus, commonly known as the narrow-thorned blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in dense, sharp thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems.</p>
