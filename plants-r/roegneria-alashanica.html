                    <h1>Roegneria alashanica</h1>
<p>Roegneria alashanica, commonly known as the Alashan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Roegneria alashanica thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a forage plant for grazing animals and its contribution to soil stabilization in fragile environments.</p>
