<p>Rousseauxia andringitrensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale blue with intricate patterns. The plant has a terrestrial growth habit and thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
