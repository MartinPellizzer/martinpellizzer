                    <h1>Rhamnus prostrata</h1>
<p>Rhamnus prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. It is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Rhamnus prostrata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy areas.</p>
