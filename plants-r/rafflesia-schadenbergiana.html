                    <h1>Rafflesia schadenbergiana</h1>
<p>Rafflesia schadenbergiana, commonly known as the Schadenberg's giant rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing one of the largest individual flowers in the world, with a diameter that can reach up to 1 meter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in its specific ecological niche despite its lack of conventional plant structures.</p>
