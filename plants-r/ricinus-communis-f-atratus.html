                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. atratus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. atratus, commonly known as the blackleaf castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its dark green, almost black foliage.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are typically large, palmately lobed, and have a striking, glossy appearance. While it shares the same genus as the common castor plant, it is cultivated primarily for its aesthetic value rather than its oil-producing properties.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in gardens for its dramatic visual impact and can grow up to several feet in height.</p>
