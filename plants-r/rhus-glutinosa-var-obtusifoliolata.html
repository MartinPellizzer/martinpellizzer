<p>Rhus glutinosa var. obtusifoliolata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 5â€“11 pairs of oval, smooth-edged leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruit that attracts birds and other wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to wet soils along streambanks and in swamps.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions make it a common invasive species in some regions.</p>
