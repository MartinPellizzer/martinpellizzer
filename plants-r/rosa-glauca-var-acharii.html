                    <h1>Rosa glauca var. acharii</h1>
<p>Rosa glauca var. acharii, commonly known as the Acharii rock rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, thornless stems covered in silvery-white, glandular hairs, which give it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, ovate, and covered in a similar silvery coating, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This hardy species is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
