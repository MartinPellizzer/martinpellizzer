                    <h1>Ranunculus pallasii var. minimus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus pallasii var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a small herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with 5 to 13 petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
