                    <h1>Rubus sciaphilus var. microphyllus</h1>
<p>Rubus sciaphilus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the shade-loving raspberry, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and compact growth habit, adapted to thrive in low-light conditions. The plant produces small, often reddish berries that are typically less showy than those of other raspberry species. It is native to temperate regions and prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation in shaded gardens.</p>
