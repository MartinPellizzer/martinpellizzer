<p>Rosa pumila var. tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that display a unique three-color patternâ€”usually white, yellow, and pink. The plant produces red hips in the fall, which are edible and used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.</p>
