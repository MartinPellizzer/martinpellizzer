                    <h1>Rubus tomentosus var. erroneus</h1>
<p>Rubus tomentosus var. erroneus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry variant, is a species of bramble native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its morphological similarities with other Rubus species, it is often misidentified, leading to its name "erroneus.".</p>
