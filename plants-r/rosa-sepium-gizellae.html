<p>Rosa sepium gizellae, commonly known as the Gizella rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple petals and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rosa genus. The plant produces fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are dark green and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa sepium gizellae is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
