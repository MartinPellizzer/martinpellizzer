                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. punicans</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. punicans, commonly known as the crimson or bloodleaf castor, is a cultivar of the castor oil plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed leaves that display a vibrant red to maroon coloration, especially when mature. The plant is a tropical perennial that thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Its leaves are not only ornamental but also contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its oil-producing capabilities.</p>
