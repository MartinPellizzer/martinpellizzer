                    <h1>Richardsiella eruciformis</h1>
<p>Richardsiella eruciformis, commonly known as the spiny coralroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster. Its unique morphology includes a spiny, fleshy rhizome and a lack of leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
