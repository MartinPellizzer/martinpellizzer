<p>Rorippa caledonica, commonly known as the Scottish water-crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to the UK and parts of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and the margins of lakes. The plant has basal leaves that are deeply lobed and submerged leaves that are thread-like, adapted for underwater life. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Rorippa caledonica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
