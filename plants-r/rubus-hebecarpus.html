                    <h1>Rubus hebecarpus</h1>
<p>Rubus hebecarpus, commonly known as the slender-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often considered less palatable than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is a common sight in the eastern and central United States.</p>
