<p>Rumex uncatus, commonly known as the curled dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often curled leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture.</p>
<p>Rumex uncatus produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by egg-shaped, reddish-brown seed pods.</p>
