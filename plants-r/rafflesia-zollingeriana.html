                    <h1>Rafflesia zollingeriana</h1>
<p>Rafflesia zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's corpse flower, is a parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is renowned for producing one of the largest floral structures in the world, with blooms reaching up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts flies and carrion beetles as pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia zollingeriana is classified as endangered, making it a critically important species for conservation efforts.</p>
