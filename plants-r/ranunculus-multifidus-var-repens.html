                    <h1>Ranunculus multifidus var. repens</h1>
<p>Ranunculus multifidus var. repens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomes that allow it to colonize moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with 5-15 petals, typically blooming from May to July. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in identification.</p>
<p>The species is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in wet environments.</p>
