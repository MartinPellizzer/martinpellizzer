                    <h1>Raphanus sativus var. chloris</h1>
<p>Raphanus sativus var. chloris, commonly known as the green radish, is a cultivated variety of the radish plant characterized by its dark green, leafy foliage and edible roots.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily grown for its tender leaves, which have a mild, slightly spicy flavor similar to that of regular radishes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-50 centimeters, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for small gardens or container cultivation. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>The green radish is often used in salads, stir-fries, and as a garnish due to its crisp texture and fresh taste.</p>
