<p>Rubus × primordialis, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart and sometimes sweet flavor. Its thorny stems and compound leaves are characteristic of the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value in gardens.</p>
