                    <h1>Rottboellia coelorachis</h1>
<p>Rottboellia coelorachis, commonly known as the false rice or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, riverbanks, and other moist soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
