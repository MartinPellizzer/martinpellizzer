                    <h1>Ranunculus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus, commonly known as the buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers with numerous petals and a central cluster of stamens. Ranunculus species are typically herbaceous, with simple, alternate leaves that are often lobed or divided. They are found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, wetlands, and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Many species are toxic due to the presence of protoanemonin, a compound that can cause skin irritation.</p>
