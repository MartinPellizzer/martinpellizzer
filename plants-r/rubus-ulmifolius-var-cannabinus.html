                    <h1>Rubus ulmifolius var. cannabinus</h1>
<p>Rubus ulmifolius var. cannabinus, commonly known as the hemp raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits composed of tiny drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic relation to Cannabis sativa, it has attracted attention for its potential in botanical research and sustainable agriculture.</p>
