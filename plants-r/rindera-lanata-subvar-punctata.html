                    <h1>Rindera lanata subvar. punctata</h1>
<p>Rindera lanata subvar. punctata, commonly known as the punctate woolly bladder, is a unique plant characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs.</p>
<p>The plant features a succulent, fleshy stem that stores water, typical of arid environments. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, aiding in reducing water loss. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to specific regions in Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
