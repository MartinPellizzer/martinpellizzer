                    <h1>Rubus ulmifolius var. inermis</h1>
<p>Rubus ulmifolius var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thornless stems, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its berries, which are typically red or black, are edible but often tart and used in jams or wines.</p>
<p>This species thrives in woodland edges and hedgerows, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
