<p>Rhamnus alaternus var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces black, egg-shaped berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various environments.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal.</p>
