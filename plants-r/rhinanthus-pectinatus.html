                    <h1>Rhinanthus pectinatus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus pectinatus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with fungi, which helps in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus pectinatus plays an important role in promoting biodiversity by reducing the dominance of dominant grasses in grassland ecosystems.</p>
