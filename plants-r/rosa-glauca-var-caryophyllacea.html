                    <h1>Rosa glauca var. caryophyllacea</h1>
<p>Rosa glauca var. caryophyllacea, commonly known as the alpine rose or pink rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in dense, silvery-white to pale blue-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive, frost-tolerant appearance. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, elliptical, and covered with fine, soft hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in alpine gardens and rockeries.</p>
