<p>Rumex tuberosus subsp.</p>
<p>contractus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the broader-leaved varieties.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender spikes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant contains various bioactive compounds, contributing to its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
