<p>Roegneria prokudinii, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Roegneria prokudinii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
