                    <h1>Rhynchium</h1>
<p>Rhynchium, commonly known as the stolon in certain orchid species, is a specialized plant structure that serves as a horizontal, underground stem.</p>
<p>It plays a crucial role in the propagation and survival of the plant by producing new shoots and roots. The rhynchium is often covered in a thin layer of tissue that protects it from environmental stress. It is distinct from other plant stems due to its ability to generate both vegetative and reproductive structures.</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature is essential for the growth and distribution of orchids in various habitats.</p>
