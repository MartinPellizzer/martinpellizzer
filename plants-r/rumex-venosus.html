                    <h1>Rumex venosus</h1>
<p>Rumex venosus, commonly known as the veined sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and a tangy, sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional cuisine, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their acidic nature.</p>
