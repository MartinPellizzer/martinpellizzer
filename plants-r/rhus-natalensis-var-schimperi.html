<p>Rhus natalensis var. schimperi, commonly known as the Natal buckthorn, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate and have a distinctive, slightly serrated appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and used in reforestation projects.</p>
