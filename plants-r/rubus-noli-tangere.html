                    <h1>Rubus noli-tangere</h1>
<p>Rubus noli-tangere, commonly known as the "touch-me-not blackberry," is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the edible berries in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>The common name refers to the plant's tendency to be avoided due to its prickly nature.</p>
