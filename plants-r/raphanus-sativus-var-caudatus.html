<p>Raphanus sativus var. caudatus, commonly known as the Chinese radish or horse radish, is a cultivated variety of the radish plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender root that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. Its roots are typically harvested before they become too woody, as they are most tender and flavorful at that stage.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which can be used in cooking or as a medicinal herb.</p>
