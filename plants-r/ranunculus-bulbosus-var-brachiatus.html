<p>Ranunculus bulbosus var. brachiatus, commonly known as the branched buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a short, rhizomatous root system and produces basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with numerous petal-like sepals, which bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
