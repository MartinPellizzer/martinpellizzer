                    <h1>Restrepiopsis monetalis</h1>
<p>Restrepiopsis monetalis, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, golden hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
