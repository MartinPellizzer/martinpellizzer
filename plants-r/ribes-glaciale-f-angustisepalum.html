<p>Ribes glaciale f. angustisepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled white currant, is a botanical variant of the white currant species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated sepals that distinguish it from the typical form of Ribes glaciale. The plant is a deciduous shrub, typically found in alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five narrow sepals and five petals.</p>
<p>It produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to regular currants but are often less commonly cultivated.</p>
