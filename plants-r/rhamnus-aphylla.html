                    <h1>Rhamnus aphylla</h1>
<p>Rhamnus aphylla, commonly known as the leafless buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for the absence of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Rhamnus aphylla is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions.</p>
