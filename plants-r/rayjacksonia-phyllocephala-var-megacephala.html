                    <h1>Rayjacksonia phyllocephala var. megacephala</h1>
<p>Rayjacksonia phyllocephala var. megacephala, commonly known as the giant leafy cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive and imposing appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, typical of its gymnosperm classification. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking foliage.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
