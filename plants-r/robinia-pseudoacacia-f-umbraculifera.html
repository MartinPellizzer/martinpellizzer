                    <h1>Robinia pseudoacacia f. umbraculifera</h1>
<p>Robinia pseudoacacia f. umbraculifera, commonly known as the shade-tolerant honeylocust, is a variant of the honeylocust tree characterized by its dense, umbrella-shaped canopy.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are typically smaller and more closely spaced than those of the typical species, providing a more compact appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by flat, dehiscent pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to thrive in partial to full shade, making it suitable for urban landscapes and shaded gardens.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to withstand less ideal growing conditions.</p>
