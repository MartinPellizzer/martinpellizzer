                    <h1>Rosa tomentella var. murbeckiana</h1>
<p>Rosa tomentella var. murbeckiana, commonly known as the Murbeck's woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are generally covered in a fine, white down, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
