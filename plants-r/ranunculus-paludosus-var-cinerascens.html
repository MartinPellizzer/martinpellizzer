<p>Ranunculus paludosus var. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces small, sparsely hairy leaves that are often submerged or floating. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and supporting insect life.</p>
