<p>Rosa hirticinericia subsp.</p>
<p>villosiformis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed rose, is a rare and less commonly cultivated subspecies of the Rosa genus. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically pink to red in color, with five to seven petals, and are borne singly or in small clusters. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
