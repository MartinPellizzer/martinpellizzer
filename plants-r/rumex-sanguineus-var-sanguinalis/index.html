<p>Red sorrel, scientifically known as Rumex sanguineus var. sanguinalis, is a vibrant and flavorful plant often found in moist soils across temperate regions. With its distinctive red-veined leaves and sour taste, it has been used for centuries in cooking and traditional medicine. Though similar to other sorrel species, this variety stands out for its unique coloration and culinary applications. Its presence in wild landscapes makes it both a valuable resource and a common weed. Despite its modest appearance, red sorrel holds cultural and ecological significance in many areas.</p>
