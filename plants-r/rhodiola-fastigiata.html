                    <h1>Rhodiola fastigiata</h1>
<p>Rhodiola fastigiata, commonly known as the compact rhodiola, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems.</p>
<p>Rhodiola fastigiata is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
