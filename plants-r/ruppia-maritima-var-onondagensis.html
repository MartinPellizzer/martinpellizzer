<p>It typically grows in brackish or saltwater habitats, such as tidal flats and estuaries. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its saline environment. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>This variety is native to coastal regions of North America and plays a role in stabilizing sediment in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
