                    <h1>Rubus glaucellus microgene accessivus</h1>
<p>Rubus glaucellus microgene accessivus, commonly known as the alpine trailing raspberry, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems with small, elliptical leaves that have a distinctive glaucous (waxy) coating. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, red drupes, which are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
