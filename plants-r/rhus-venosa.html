                    <h1>Rhus venosa</h1>
<p>Rhus venosa, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, branched stems that resemble antlers, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and turn vibrant shades of red in autumn.</p>
<p>Rhus venosa is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, and it is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions.</p>
