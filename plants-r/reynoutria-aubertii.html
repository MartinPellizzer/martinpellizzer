                    <h1>Reynoutria aubertii</h1>
<p>Reynoutria aubertii, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, rhizomatous stems that can grow up to several meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in late summer, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a significant ecological concern in many regions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is closely related to other members of the knotweed genus.</p>
