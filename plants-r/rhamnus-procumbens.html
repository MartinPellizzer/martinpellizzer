                    <h1>Rhamnus procumbens</h1>
<p>Rhamnus procumbens, commonly known as creeping buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, simple leaves that are usually alternate and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in ecological restoration projects.</p>
