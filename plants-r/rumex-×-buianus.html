                    <h1>Rumex × buianus</h1>
<p>Rumex × buianus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broad-leaved sorrel).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves contain high levels of oxalic acid, which gives them a tart, sour taste. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
