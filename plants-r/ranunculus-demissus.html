                    <h1>Ranunculus demissus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus demissus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a fibrous root system and produces basal leaves that are broadly heart-shaped with a waxy surface. The plant blooms in early spring with clusters of bright yellow flowers that have 5 to 8 sepals and no true petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks.</p>
<p>Ranunculus demissus is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
