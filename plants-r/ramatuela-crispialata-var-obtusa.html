                    <h1>Ramatuela crispialata var. obtusa</h1>
<p>Ramatuela crispialata var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed ramatuela, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, blooming from late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in Mediterranean climates.</p>
