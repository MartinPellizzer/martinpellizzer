                    <h1>Rumex occidentalis var. labradoricus</h1>
<p>Rumex occidentalis var. labradoricus, commonly known as Labrador sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them best cooked before consumption.</p>
<p>This variant is part of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other sorrel species.</p>
