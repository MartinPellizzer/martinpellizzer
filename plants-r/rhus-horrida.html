                    <h1>Rhus horrida</h1>
<p>Rhus horrida, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bright green in summer and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Rhus horrida thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its rough, thorny stems and distinctive foliage make it easily identifiable in the wild.</p>
