                    <h1>Rhynchospora corymbosa var. asperula</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora corymbosa var. asperula, commonly known as the rough spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features erect, hairless stems that bear whorled clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
