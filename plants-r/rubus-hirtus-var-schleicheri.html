<p>Rubus hirtus var. schleicheri, commonly known as the Schleicher's bramble, is a variant of the common bramble found in parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces red or black berries in the autumn. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its specific morphology and genetic variation from the typical Rubus hirtus.</p>
