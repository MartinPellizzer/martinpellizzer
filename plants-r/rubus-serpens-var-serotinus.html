                    <h1>Rubus serpens var. serotinus</h1>
<p>Rubus serpens var. serotinus, commonly known as the late-fruiting blackberry bush, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb or spread along the ground. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen later in the season compared to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this plant make it well-adapted to its native habitat and distinguish it from other varieties within the Rubus genus.</p>
