                    <h1>Rubus caesius var. psilophyllus</h1>
<p>Rubus caesius var. psilophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Rubus caesius. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique leaf structure, it is sometimes used in horticultural studies to understand leaf morphology in the Rubus genus.</p>
