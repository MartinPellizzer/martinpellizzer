<p>Roella squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is adapted to absorb water efficiently from deep within the soil.</p>
<p>Roella squarrosa is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
