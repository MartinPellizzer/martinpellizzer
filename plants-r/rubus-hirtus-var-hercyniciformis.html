<p>Rubus hirtus var. hercyniciformis, commonly known as the Hercyniciform Raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
