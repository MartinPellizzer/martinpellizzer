<p>Rosa glauca var. prosadenophora, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and unique variant of the Rosa glauca species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking deep blue petals, which are a result of high concentrations of delphinidin, a type of anthocyanin pigment.

The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and produces fragrant flowers in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly sought after by horticulturists and botanists alike.</p>
