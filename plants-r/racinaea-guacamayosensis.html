<p>Racinaea guacamayosensis, commonly known as the Guacamayos racemose orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in high elevation areas with consistent moisture and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
