                    <h1>Rebutia aureiflora f. boedekeriana</h1>
<p>Rebutia aureiflora f. boedekeriana, commonly known as the Boedeker's golden flower, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne in clusters at the stem tips. It is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its compact size and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
