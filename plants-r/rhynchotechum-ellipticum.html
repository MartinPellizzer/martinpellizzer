<p>Rhynchotechum ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptical thyme.</p>
<p>This perennial herb is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Rhynchotechum ellipticum is often used in rock gardens due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance.</p>
