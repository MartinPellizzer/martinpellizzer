                            <h1>Rubia Mollugo</h1>
<p>Rubia mollugo is a small, flowering plant known for its delicate appearance and unique growth habits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks. This species belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other familiar plants like coffee and gardenias. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the undergrowth. Despite its modest size, Rubia mollugo plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
