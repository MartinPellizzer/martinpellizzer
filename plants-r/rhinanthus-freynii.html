                    <h1>Rhinanthus freynii</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus freynii, commonly known as the Frey's blazing star, is a flowering plant native to the central and southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats like prairies and woodland edges, and is often found in association with grasses and forbs.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus freynii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens.</p>
