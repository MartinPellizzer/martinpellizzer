<p>Rytigynia gossweileri, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
