                    <h1>Rhipsalis parasitica</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis parasitica, commonly known as the mistletoe cactus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, though it can photosynthesize to a limited extent. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is typically a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis parasitica is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
