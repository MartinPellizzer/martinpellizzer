                    <h1>Reynoutria japonica</h1>
<p>Reynoutria japonica, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, berry-like fruits. It is highly invasive in many regions outside its native range, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and extensive root system, it is considered a significant ecological threat.</p>
