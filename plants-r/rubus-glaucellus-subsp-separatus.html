<p>Rubus glaucellus subsp.</p>
<p>separatus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, red drupes that ripen in late summer. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
