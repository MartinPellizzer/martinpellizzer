                    <h1>Ruscus streptophyllus</h1>
<p>Ruscus streptophyllus, commonly known as creeping forest spurge, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in temperate climates.</p>
