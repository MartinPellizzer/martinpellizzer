<p>Rhododendron palustre, commonly known as the marsh rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland and bog environments in northern regions.</p>
<p>It features dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer.

<p>Rhododendron palustre plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
