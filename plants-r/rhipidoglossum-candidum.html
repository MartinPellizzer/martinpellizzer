                    <h1>Rhipidoglossum candidum</h1>
<p>Rhipidoglossum candidum, commonly known as the white-tongued orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and the flowers are clustered in a dense inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
