<p>Ritchiea pynaertii, commonly known as the Pynaert's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant exhibits dioecious reproduction, with separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ritchiea pynaertii is considered endangered and is protected by conservation efforts.</p>
