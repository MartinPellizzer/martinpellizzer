                    <h1>Rosa glauca var. fugax</h1>
<p>Rosa glauca var. fugax, commonly known as the transient blue rose, is a rare and delicate variant of the Rosa glauca species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale blue petals, which are a result of a unique pigmentation caused by the presence of delphinidin. This plant typically blooms in early spring and has a short flowering period, contributing to its name "fugax," meaning fleeting or transient. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ephemeral beauty, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
