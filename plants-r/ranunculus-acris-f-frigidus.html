                    <h1>Ranunculus acris f. frigidus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus acris f. frigidus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a botanical variant of the common buttercup.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate flowers and shorter, stiffer stems compared to the typical form. This subspecies is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in early summer.</p>
