<p>Randia venulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or smallleaf randia, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that range in color from red to orange. Randia venulosa is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various environments.</p>
