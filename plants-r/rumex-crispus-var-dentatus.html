                    <h1>Rumex crispus var. dentatus</h1>
<p>Rumex crispus var. dentatus, commonly known as the serrated dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crinkled, wavy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The leaves and roots have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
