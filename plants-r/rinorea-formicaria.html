                    <h1>Rinorea formicaria</h1>
<p>Rinorea formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing numerous seeds. One of its most notable botanical features is its ability to secrete a sticky substance that attracts ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores.</p>
<p>This mutualistic relationship with ants is a key aspect of its ecological adaptation.</p>
