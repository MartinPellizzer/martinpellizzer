                    <h1>Rumex × ogulinensis</h1>
<p>Rumex × ogulinensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetobatus.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a reddish or purple coloration on the veins. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences, producing achenes as its reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, Rumex × ogulinensis shows genetic variability and can be challenging to classify botanically.</p>
