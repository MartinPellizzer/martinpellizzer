                    <h1>Rhododendron ovatum var. setuliferum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron ovatum var. setuliferum, commonly known as the hairy leaved rhododendron, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it its varietal name "setuliferum," meaning "bearing hairs.". The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and prolonged flowering period.</p>
