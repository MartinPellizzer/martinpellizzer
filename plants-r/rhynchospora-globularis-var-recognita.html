The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity and maintaining soil stability in aquatic environments.</p>
