                    <h1>Rhytidophyllum minus</h1>
<p>Rhytidophyllum minus, commonly known as the small barkless cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is notable for its lack of a true bark, which distinguishes it from other cycad species. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhytidophyllum minus is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
