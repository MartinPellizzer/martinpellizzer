<p>Rhinanthus javorkae, commonly known as the Java rue, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in regions with temperate climates. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
