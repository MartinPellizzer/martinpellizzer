                    <h1>Rumex quarrei</h1>
<p>Rumex quarrei, commonly known as the narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib and a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it produces oval, three-angled fruits.</p>
<p>Rumex quarrei is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
