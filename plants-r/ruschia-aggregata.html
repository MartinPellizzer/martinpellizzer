<p>Ruschia aggregata, commonly known as the clustered Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems that often branch out, forming dense clusters of foliage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ruschia aggregata is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance.</p>
