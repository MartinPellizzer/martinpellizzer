<p>Rumex repandus, commonly known as broadleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides, in meadows, and near water bodies. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, greenish flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and form dense stands.</p>
