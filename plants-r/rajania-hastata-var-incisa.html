                    <h1>Rajania hastata var. incisa</h1>
<p>Rajania hastata var. incisa, commonly known as the serrated leaf rajania, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of a fern. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
