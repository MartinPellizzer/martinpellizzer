                    <h1>Rosa canina f. anthocyanea</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. anthocyanea, commonly known as the purple-hipped dogrose, is a botanical variant of the common dogrose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive deep purple or nearly black hips, which contrast with its pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and scrublands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces thorny stems typical of the Rosa genus.</p>
<p>This form is less commonly cultivated than the standard Rosa canina but is valued for its ornamental and historical significance.</p>
