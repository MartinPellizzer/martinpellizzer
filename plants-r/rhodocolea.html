                    <h1>Rhodocolea</h1>
<p>Rhodocolea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in a variety of colors. Rhodocolea species typically have a compact growth habit and are well-suited for indoor cultivation due to their preference for bright, indirect light. They produce flowers on long, slender stems, and their foliage is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Rhodocolea coccinea and Rhodocolea multiflora, which are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
