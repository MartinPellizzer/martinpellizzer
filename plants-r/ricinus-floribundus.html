                    <h1>Ricinus floribundus</h1>
<p>Ricinus floribundus, commonly known as the flowering castor plant, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, red bracts that enclose its small yellow flowers. The plant produces a toxic seed capsule containing seeds with a high oil content, which can be processed into castor oil. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful handling due to the presence of toxic compounds in its sap and seeds.</p>
