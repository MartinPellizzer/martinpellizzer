                    <h1>Rhizocephalus turkestanicus</h1>
<p>Rhizocephalus turkestanicus, commonly known as the Turkestan rhizocephalan, is a marine parasitic barnacle that infects crustacean hosts.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its complex life cycle, which involves a free-swimming larval stage known as a cyprid. The adult form develops into a specialized, root-like structure that infiltrates the host's body, extracting nutrients. It lacks a true shell and instead has a calcified exoskeleton.</p>
<p>This species is primarily found in the Indo-Pacific region, where it plays a significant role in marine ecosystems as a parasite.</p>
