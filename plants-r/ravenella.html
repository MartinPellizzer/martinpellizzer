<p>Ravenella, commonly known as the "screw pine," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give the plant a unique, almost twisted appearance. Ravenella species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in coastal or wetland areas. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
