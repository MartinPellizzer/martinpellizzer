<p>Rubus tomentosus var. densus, commonly known as the dense bristled blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a slightly tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and potential use in both ornamental gardening and local food systems.</p>
