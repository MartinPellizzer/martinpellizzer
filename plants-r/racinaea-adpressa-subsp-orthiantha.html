<p>Racinaea adpressa subsp.</p>
<p>orthiantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf racinaea, is a rare and specialized fern native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds that form a rosette-like structure, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, almost metallic sheen on the upper surface. It produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of its fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
