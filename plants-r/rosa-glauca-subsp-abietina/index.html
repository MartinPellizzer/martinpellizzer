                            <h1>Rosa Glauca Subsp. Abietina</h1>
<p>Rosa glauca subsp. abietina is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is known for its pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring. This subspecies is closely related to the common rose but has unique adaptations to its harsh mountain environment. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
