The leaves are narrow and elongated, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pale blue or purple.</p>
<p>Rymandra is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
