<p>Rubus involutus, commonly known as the curled bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb or spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are often curled at the edges, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Rubus involutus is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
