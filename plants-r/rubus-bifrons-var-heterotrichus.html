                    <h1>Rubus bifrons var. heterotrichus</h1>
<p>Rubus bifrons var. heterotrichus, commonly known as the variable blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a slight tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its variability in leaf and fruit morphology, it is a subject of taxonomic interest among botanists.</p>
