<p>Rhipsalis bartlettii, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features long, thin, branching stems that are covered in small, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
