                    <h1>Rosa pendulina haematodes</h1>
<p>Rosa pendulina haematodes, commonly known as the blood-red hanging rose, is a rare and striking species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping stems and clusters of deep red, velvety flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its thorns are slender and not particularly prominent. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
