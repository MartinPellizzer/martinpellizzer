<p>Rosa communis var. alpestroformis, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
