                    <h1>Renealmia aromatica</h1>
<p>Renealmia aromatica, commonly known as the sweetgrass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, golden-yellow inflorescences. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, often forming dense stands that contribute to the ecological stability of these habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>The plant's fragrance has been historically used by indigenous communities for ceremonial and medicinal purposes.</p>
