<p>Rosa sempervirens f. scandens, commonly known as the creeping pink rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub with dense, thornless stems that form a mat-like growth.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its spreading habit.</p>
<p>Native to southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
