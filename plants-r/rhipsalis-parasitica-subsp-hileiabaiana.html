<p>Rhipsalis parasitica subsp.</p>
<p>hileiabaiana, commonly known as the Hileiabaiana mistletoe cactus, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It attaches itself to the stems of host trees, such as those in the Euphorbiaceae family, using specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, often in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its foliage consists of fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique ecological role as both a parasite and a potential food source for certain insect species.</p>
