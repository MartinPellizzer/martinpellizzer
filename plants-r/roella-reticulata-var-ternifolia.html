The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild.</p>
