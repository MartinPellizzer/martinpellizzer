<p>Reichea coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbensis tree, is a unique plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is a type of cycad, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant is adapted to extreme aridity, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and resilient species.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is protected in its natural habitat.</p>
