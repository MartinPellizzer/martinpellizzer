                    <h1>Rubus villicaulis var. subincertus</h1>
<p>Rubus villicaulis var. subincertus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry bush, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its variability, it can be challenging to distinguish from other Rubus species in the field.</p>
