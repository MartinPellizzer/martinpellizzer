                    <h1>Rosa × collina</h1>
<p>Rosa × collina, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rosa alpina and Rosa glacialis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. The plant typically produces fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Rosa × collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat.</p>
