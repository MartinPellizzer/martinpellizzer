<p>mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican castor oil plant, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and distinctive spiny calyces surrounding its flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic, oily seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and the presence of ricin in its seeds, it is both cultivated and considered potentially hazardous.</p>
