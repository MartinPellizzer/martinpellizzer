<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>paludum, commonly known as the bog buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist environment. It thrives in peat bogs and marshes, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in supporting diverse invertebrate life.</p>
