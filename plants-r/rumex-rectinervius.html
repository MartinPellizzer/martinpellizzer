                    <h1>Rumex rectinervius</h1>
<p>Rumex rectinervius, commonly known as the narrow-veined sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It features distinctive leaves with a prominent central vein and a serrated margin, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation.</p>
