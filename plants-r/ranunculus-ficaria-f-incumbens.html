                    <h1>Ranunculus ficaria f. incumbens</h1>
<p>Ranunculus ficaria f. incumbens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant produces small, hairy seed capsules that release seeds through a mechanism called explosive dehiscence. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it both a common weed and a valuable ground cover in certain habitats.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
