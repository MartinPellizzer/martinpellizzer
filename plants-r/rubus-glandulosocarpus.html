                    <h1>Rubus glandulosocarpus</h1>
<p>Rubus glandulosocarpus, commonly known as the glandular-fruited blackberry, is a species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy underside, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in culinary applications due to the small size and tart flavor of its fruit.</p>
