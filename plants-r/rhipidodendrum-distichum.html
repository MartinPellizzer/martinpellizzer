                <h1>Rhipidodendrum distichum</h1>
<p>Rhipidodendrum distichum, commonly known as the two-ranked fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique leaf structure.</p>
<p>Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, giving the plant a delicate, feather-like appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
