<p>Ruschia edentula, commonly known as the toothless ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ruschia edentula is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
