                    <h1>Rubus × ithytrichus</h1>
<p>Rubus × ithytrichus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, combining the thorny canes of blackberries with the more delicate, less prickly structure of raspberries. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart and sometimes sweet flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its ornamental value and its use in culinary applications.</p>
