                    <h1>Rhamnus soporifera</h1>
<p>Rhamnus soporifera, commonly known as the sleepyleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, glossy berries. These berries are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption.</p>
<p>The species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported sedative properties.</p>
