<p>Ranunculus acris subsp.</p>
<p>glabriusculus, commonly known as the slenderleaf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the subspecies glabriusculus is distinguished by its smoother, glabrous leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
