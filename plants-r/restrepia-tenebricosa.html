<p>Restrepia tenebricosa, commonly known as the dark shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and small, pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. This orchid thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or among moss-covered rocks. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its cryptic nature, Restrepia tenebricosa is considered endangered.</p>
