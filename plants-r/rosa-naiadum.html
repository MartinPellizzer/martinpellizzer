                    <h1>Rosa naiadum</h1>
<p>Rosa naiadum, commonly known as the water rose, is a rare aquatic plant found in still freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It has delicate, floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Rosa naiadum is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
