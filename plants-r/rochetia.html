                    <h1>Rochetia</h1>
<p>Rochetia, commonly known as the "butterfly orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that resemble butterflies, with showy petals and sepals. These plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Rochetia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>They thrive in humid, shaded environments and are valued for their ornamental beauty in horticulture.</p>
