                    <h1>Rubus fruticosus var. ulmifolius</h1>
<p>Rubus fruticosus var. ulmifolius, commonly known as brambles or blackberries, is a thorny shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five lobed and resemble those of the elm tree, hence its specific epithet *ulmifolius*. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is a common weed in many regions.</p>
