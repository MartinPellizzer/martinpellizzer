<p>Restrepia gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's restrepia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are usually dark green and革质 (leathery), providing a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Restrepia gardneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
