                    <h1>Rotala vasudevanii</h1>
<p>Rotala vasudevanii, commonly known as the Indian waterwheel plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features whorled leaves that are typically bright green and have a waxy surface, which helps it float on water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or green, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Rotala vasudevanii is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to oxygenate water.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful and sometimes challenging plant to manage in aquatic environments.</p>
