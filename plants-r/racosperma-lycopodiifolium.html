                    <h1>Racosperma lycopodiifolium</h1>
<p>Racosperma lycopodiifolium, commonly known as the lace fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that resemble those of true ferns, despite being a clubmoss. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporophylls, are arranged in compact clusters, typical of its evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
