                    <h1>Rubus plicatus f. opacus</h1>
<p>Rubus plicatus f. opacus, commonly known as the opake raspberry, is a distinctive variant of the common raspberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, foliage and densely hairy stems, which give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, typically red or yellow berries, which are edible but often less flavorful than those of the common raspberry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable subject for horticultural and ecological study.</p>
