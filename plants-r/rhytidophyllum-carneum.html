                    <h1>Rhytidophyllum carneum</h1>
<p>Rhytidophyllum carneum, commonly known as the red-bark cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces distinctive cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
