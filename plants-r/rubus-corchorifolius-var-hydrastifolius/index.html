                            <h1>Rubus Corchorifolius Var. Hydrastifolius</h1>
<p>Rubus corchorifolius var. hydrastifolius is a lesser-known species of raspberry that thrives in cool, moist climates. It is native to parts of eastern Asia and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. The plant is distinguished by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, edible berries. Its unique appearance and flavor make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. Despite its potential, it remains underappreciated compared to more common raspberry varieties.</p>
