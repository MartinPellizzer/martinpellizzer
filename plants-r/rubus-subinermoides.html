                    <h1>Rubus subinermoides</h1>
<p>Rubus subinermoides, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thornless stems, which distinguish it from many other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in alpine ecosystems.</p>
