                    <h1>Rhacoma riparia var. puberula</h1>
<p>Rhacoma riparia var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent river willow, is a variant of the river willow native to riparian zones in North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils. The plant is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
