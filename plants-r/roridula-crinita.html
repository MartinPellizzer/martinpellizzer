                    <h1>Roridula crinita</h1>
<p>Roridula crinita, commonly known as the hairless dew plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky, resinous substance, which is believed to help collect moisture from the air. The plant's flowers are typically yellow or orange, with tubular shapes that attract specific pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Roridula crinita is also notable for its unusual relationship with a specific insect, the roridula bug, which resides in the plant's leaves.</p>
