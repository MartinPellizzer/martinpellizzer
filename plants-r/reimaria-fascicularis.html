<p>Reimaria fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered reindeer moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has elongated, leafy shoots that are often clustered together, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are borne on stalks and are distinctive in appearance.</p>
<p>Reimaria fascicularis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
