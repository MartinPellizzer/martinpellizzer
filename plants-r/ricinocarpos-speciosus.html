                    <h1>Ricinocarpos speciosus</h1>
<p>Ricinocarpos speciosus, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and small, white or pale flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its roots penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, making it dependent on its host for survival.</p>
<p>Ricinocarpos speciosus is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas with high humidity.</p>
