<p>Ruttya fruticosa, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to various regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host trees, such as acacia and eucalyptus, through its haustellum, which allows it to draw water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems.</p>
<p>Ruttya fruticosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
