<p>Reseda eremophila, commonly known as the desert rue, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer months. It is adapted to survive in poor soil conditions and can withstand prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Reseda eremophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
