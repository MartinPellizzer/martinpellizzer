                    <h1>Rottboellia rugosa</h1>
<p>Rottboellia rugosa, commonly known as the rough carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are typically rough to the touch, with a distinctive rugose texture.</p>
<p>Rottboellia rugosa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
