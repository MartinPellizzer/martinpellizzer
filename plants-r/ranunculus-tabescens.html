                    <h1>Ranunculus tabescens</h1>
<p>Ranunculus tabescens, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its short growing season, it blooms early in the spring before the summer heat arrives.</p>
