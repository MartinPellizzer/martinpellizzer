<p>Rubus speluncarum, commonly known as the cave raspberry, is a rare shrub native to subterranean environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in dark, humid caves and is adapted to low light conditions. The plant produces small, edible berries similar to regular raspberries, though they are typically smaller and more acidic. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a hairy texture, and it has a robust root system to anchor itself in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an endangered species with limited geographic distribution.</p>
