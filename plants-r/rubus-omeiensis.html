<p>Rubus omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei raspberry, is a species of brambles native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, though they may vary in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied member of the Rubus genus.</p>
