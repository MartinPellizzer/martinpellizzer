<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of leaflets, and its distinctive red, fuzzy fruits that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and open fields. Its bark, which is rough and scaly, becomes more pronounced with age, and it produces a yellowish sap that can cause skin irritation.</p>
