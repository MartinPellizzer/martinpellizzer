<p>Rhus flexuosa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Rhus flexuosa thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common component of disturbed habitats.</p>
