                    <h1>Rotheca sansibarensis f. tomentella</h1>
<p>Rotheca sansibarensis f. tomentella, commonly known as the tomentellum form of the East African rotheca, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to coastal conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a notable species in local flora.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare and not widely cultivated outside its native habitat.</p>
