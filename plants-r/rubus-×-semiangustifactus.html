                    <h1>Rubus × semiangustifactus</h1>
<p>Rubus × semiangustifactus, commonly known as the blackberry loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a cross between the blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) and the loganberry (Rubus ursinus), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces large, dark purple to black fruits that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. Its thorny stems and compound leaves are typical of the Rubus genus, while its fruit morphology reflects a blend of both parental traits.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often cultivated for its unique flavor and is used in both culinary and commercial applications.</p>
