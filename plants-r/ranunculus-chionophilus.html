<p>Ranunculus chionophilus, commonly known as the snow-loving buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a contrasting central blotch. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds via the wind.</p>
<p>Ranunculus chionophilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
