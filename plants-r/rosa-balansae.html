                    <h1>Rosa balansae</h1>
<p>Rosa balansae, commonly known as the Balansae rose, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and thorny stems typical of many rose species. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
