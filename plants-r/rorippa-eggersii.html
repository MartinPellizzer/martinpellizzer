<p>Rorippa eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' watercress, is a small, annual flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near streams, rivers, and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, rounded seed pods.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rorippa eggersii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
