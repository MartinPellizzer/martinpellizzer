                    <h1>Rubus hirtus var. hystriciformis</h1>
<p>Rubus hirtus var. hystriciformis, commonly known as the thorny raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bristly pubescence and thorned stems, which contribute to its rugged appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can be cultivated for its edible berries.</p>
