<p>Ranunculus repens var. latisectus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, buttercup-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale yellow petals. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often broader than those of the typical Ranunculus repens.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and wet meadows.</p>
