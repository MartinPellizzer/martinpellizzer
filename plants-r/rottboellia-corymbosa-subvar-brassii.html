                    <h1>Rottboellia corymbosa subvar. brassii</h1>
<p>Rottboellia corymbosa subvar. brassii, commonly known as false brome, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has tufted,丛生 growth habit with slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover but also a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
