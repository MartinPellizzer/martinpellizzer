                    <h1>Rhodoptera</h1>
<p>Rhodoptera, commonly known as the sunset butterfly, is a genus of butterflies found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>These butterflies are characterized by their vibrant, often iridescent wing patterns that resemble the hues of a sunset. The plants they interact with are typically flowering species, which provide nectar for their feeding habits. Their life cycle involves a complex relationship with host plants for laying eggs and feeding larvae.</p>
<p>Botanically, the study of Rhodoptera includes understanding their ecological roles and interactions with plant communities.</p>
