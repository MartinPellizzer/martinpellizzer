<p>Rhamnus revoluta, commonly known as the Turkish buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters and is characterized by its thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries in the fall.
