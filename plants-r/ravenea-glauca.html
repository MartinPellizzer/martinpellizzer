                    <h1>Ravenea glauca</h1>
<p>Ravenea glauca, commonly known as the Blue Ravenea, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that exhibit a unique blue-gray coloration, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Ravenea glauca is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
