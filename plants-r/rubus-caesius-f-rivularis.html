                    <h1>Rubus caesius f. rivularis</h1>
<p>Rubus caesius f. rivularis, commonly known as the river raspberry, is a variant of the red raspberry that thrives in moist, often rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and clusters of small, bright red berries. It typically grows in riparian zones, where it benefits from the consistent moisture provided by nearby water sources. The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered in fine, silvery hairs.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
