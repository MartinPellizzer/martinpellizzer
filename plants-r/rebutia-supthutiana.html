                    <h1>Rebutia supthutiana</h1>
<p>Rebutia supthutiana, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a thick, fleshy base that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically small, spiny, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rebutia supthutiana is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
