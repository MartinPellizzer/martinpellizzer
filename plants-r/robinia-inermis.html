<p>Robinia inermis, commonly known as the silky locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a soft, silky texture due to the fine hairs covering them. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its seed pods are long and slender, containing several flat, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Robinia inermis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas.</p>
