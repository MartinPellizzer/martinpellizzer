<p>Rumex dentatus subsp.</p>
<p>nigricans, commonly known as the black-stem dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dark green, often hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers moist, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
