                    <h1>Rupicapnos caput-plataleae</h1>
<p>Rupicapnos caput-plataleae, commonly known as the flat-headed rupicapnos, is a member of the Berberidaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but typically consumed by birds rather than humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>
