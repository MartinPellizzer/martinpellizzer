                    <h1>Rosettea cordifolia</h1>
<p>Rosettea cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf rosette, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, compact rosette of fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in its harsh environment. It produces vibrant yellow flowers in late winter or early spring, adding a dramatic contrast to its foliage.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or arid landscapes, requiring minimal water and full sun.</p>
