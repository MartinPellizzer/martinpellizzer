<p>Rhopalopilia soyauxii, commonly known as the Soyaux's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered.</p>
