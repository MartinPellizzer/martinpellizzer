                    <h1>Rottboellia corrugata var. areolata</h1>
<p>Rottboellia corrugata var. areolata, commonly known as the African grass or African carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense cover make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed.</p>
