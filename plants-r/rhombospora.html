<p>Rhombospora, commonly known as the rhomboid moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhomboidal (diamond-shaped) leaf cells, which give it its scientific name. These mosses typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plants are small, with upright stems and dense, cushion-like growth forms.</p>
<p>Rhombospora species are often found in temperate regions and contribute to soil stabilization and moisture retention in their habitats.</p>
