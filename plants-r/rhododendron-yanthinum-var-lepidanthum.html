The plant prefers acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its unique leaf coloration makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
