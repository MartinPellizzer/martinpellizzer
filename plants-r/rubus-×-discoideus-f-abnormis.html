                    <h1>Rubus × discoideus f. abnormis</h1>
<p>Rubus × discoideus f. abnormis, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a unique variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral and fruit morphology.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species that exhibits a range of botanical features, including hairy stems and leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, though they may vary in color depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it adapts to cold climates and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for studying plant hybridization and adaptation to extreme habitats.</p>
