The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated margins, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
