                    <h1>Rytigynia</h1>
<p>Rytigynia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rytigyniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are typically yellow or white, with five petals and are clustered in inflorescences. Rytigynia species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides.</p>
<p>These plants are not widely cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological roles.</p>
