                    <h1>Ritchiea</h1>
<p>Ritchiea, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a type of epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, tree-like appearance with a central trunk and branching fronds that resemble antlers. The plant's aerial roots help it attach to trees or rocks, allowing it to grow in shaded, humid environments. Ritchiea species typically thrive in high humidity and indirect light, making them popular in indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ease of care have made it a favored ornamental plant among horticulturists.</p>
