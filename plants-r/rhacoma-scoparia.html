                    <h1>Rhacoma scoparia</h1>
<p>Rhacoma scoparia, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its adaptability to saline and sandy soils makes it a common sight in coastal dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>Rhacoma scoparia plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
