<p>Rhopalephora micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered climbing fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and delicate, compound leaves that are often divided into small, ovate lobes. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, spore-bearing structures called sorus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
