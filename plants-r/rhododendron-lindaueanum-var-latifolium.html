The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
