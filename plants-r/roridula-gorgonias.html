                    <h1>Roridula gorgonias</h1>
<p>Roridula gorgonias, commonly known as the "gum plant" or "gum bush," is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that secrete a viscous, resin-like substance. The plant's leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Roridula gorgonias is a member of the Roridulaceae family, which is closely related to the dandelion family.</p>
<p>Its unusual morphology and adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
