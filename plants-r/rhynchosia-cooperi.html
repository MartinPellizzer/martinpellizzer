<p>Rhynchosia cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's burr, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive burr-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the development of spiny, three-lobed pods. Rhynchosia cooperi is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria contributes to its ecological adaptability.</p>
