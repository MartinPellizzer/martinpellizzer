                    <h1>Ruschia sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Ruschia sarmentosa, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the cooler months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for container gardening as well.</p>
