<p>Rubus pastasanus, commonly known as the pastasanus raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied member of the Rubus genus.</p>
