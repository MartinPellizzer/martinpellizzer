<p>Roupala gardneri, commonly known as the silver tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on its leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal environments with well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
