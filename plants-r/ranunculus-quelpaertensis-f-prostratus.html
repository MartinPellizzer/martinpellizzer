                    <h1>Ranunculus quelpaertensis f. prostratus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus quelpaertensis f. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate meadow buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early spring blooms.</p>
