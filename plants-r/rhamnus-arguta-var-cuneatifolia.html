<p>Rhamnus arguta var. cuneatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are typically lanceolate or narrow-ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
