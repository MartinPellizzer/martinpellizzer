                    <h1>Ratonia litoralis</h1>
<p>Ratonia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal ratonia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Ratonia litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
