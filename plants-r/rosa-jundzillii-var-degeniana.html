                    <h1>Rosa jundzillii var. degeniana</h1>
<p>Rosa jundzillii var. degeniana, commonly known as the Degen's rose, is a rare and highly sought-after species native to the high altitudes of the Tian Shan mountains in Central Asia.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with tightly clustered, semi-evergreen foliage that retains its color throughout much of the year. The flowers are typically pink to red, with a velvety texture and a strong, spicy fragrance. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in cool, dry climates and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered an endangered species and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
