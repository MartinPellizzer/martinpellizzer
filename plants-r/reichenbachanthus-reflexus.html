<p>Reichenbachanthus reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers with intricate, reflexed petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions with high humidity. Its small, tubular flowers are usually a combination of white and purple, and it blooms during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
