                    <h1>Robinia glutinosa</h1>
<p>Robinia glutinosa, commonly known as the honeylocust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn and its distinctive, thorned branches. The tree produces small, green pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters, adding ornamental value to the landscape.</p>
<p>Robinia glutinosa has a deep root system and is often used in reforestation due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
