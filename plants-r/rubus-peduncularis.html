<p>Rubus peduncularis, commonly known as the trailing raspberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow, similar to raspberries but often less flavorful. Its leaves are alternate, palmately compound, and have serrated edges.</p>
<p>Rubus peduncularis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
