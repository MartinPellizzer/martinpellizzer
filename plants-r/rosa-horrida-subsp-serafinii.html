<p>Rosa horrida subsp.</p>
<p>serafinii, commonly known as the Serafini's prickly rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorned stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage consists of dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant, five-petaled blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
