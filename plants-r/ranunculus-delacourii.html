                    <h1>Ranunculus delacourii</h1>
<p>Ranunculus delacourii, commonly known as Delacour's buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tian Shan and Pamir ranges. This perennial herb features showy, yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals and a central cluster of stamens. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
