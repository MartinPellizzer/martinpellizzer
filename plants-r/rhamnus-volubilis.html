<p>Rhamnus volubilis, commonly known as the creeping buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively along forest floors and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with smooth margins and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Rhamnus volubilis is often found in moist, shaded environments and can form dense thickets, impacting native plant communities.</p>
