                    <h1>Rhododendron × kewense</h1>
<p>Rhododendron × kewense, commonly known as the Kew rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron ferrugineum and Rhododendron caucasicum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is evergreen, with broad, oval leaves that remain on the shrub throughout the year. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form compact, bushy growth that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
