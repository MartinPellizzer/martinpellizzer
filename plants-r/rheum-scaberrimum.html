<p>Rheum scaberrimum, commonly known as the rough rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features tall, fibrous stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are clustered in panicles and consist of both male and female parts, typical of the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>The roots of Rheum scaberrimum are thick and fleshy, containing high levels of anthraquinone compounds, which have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
