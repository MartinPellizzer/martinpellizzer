<p>Rhus schmidelioides, commonly known as the sandpaper oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, sandpapery texture on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles, followed by clusters of red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with finely toothed margins.</p>
<p>Rhus schmidelioides is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland dunes.</p>
