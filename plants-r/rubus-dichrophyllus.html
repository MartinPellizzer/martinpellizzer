<p>Rubus dichrophyllus, commonly known as the two-leaved bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, prickly stems. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, followed by red or black berries that are edible but often tart. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with two small leaflets on one side and a larger one on the other, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Rubus dichrophyllus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
