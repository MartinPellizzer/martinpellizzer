<p>Ruschia profunda, commonly known as the deep-rooted Ruschia, is a perennial succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates.</p>
