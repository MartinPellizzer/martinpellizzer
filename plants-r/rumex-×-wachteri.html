<p>Rumex × wachteri, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel). The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its genetic parentage.</p>
