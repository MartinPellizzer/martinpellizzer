                    <h1>Rubus × tornaticaulis</h1>
<p>Rubus × tornaticaulis, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry).</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that resemble both blackberries and raspberries. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are typically tart and acidic, with a unique flavor profile. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid that showcases the genetic diversity within the Rubus genus.</p>
