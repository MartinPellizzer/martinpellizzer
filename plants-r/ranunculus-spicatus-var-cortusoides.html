<p>Ranunculus spicatus var. cortusoides, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
