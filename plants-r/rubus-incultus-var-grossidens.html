The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>The berries are edible, though they are generally less palatable than commercially cultivated blackberries.</p>
