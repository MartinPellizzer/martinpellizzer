<p>Roettlera barbinervia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds through wind.</p>
<p>Roettlera barbinervia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
