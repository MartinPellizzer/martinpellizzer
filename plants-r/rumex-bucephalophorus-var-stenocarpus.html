                    <h1>Rumex bucephalophorus var. stenocarpus</h1>
<p>Rumex bucephalophorus var. stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruited dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish hue on the underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
