                    <h1>Rytidosperma viride</h1>
<p>Rytidosperma viride, commonly known as green rytidosperma, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue, which is due to the presence of a waxy coating on the leaf surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments.</p>
<p>Rytidosperma viride is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
