<p>Rubus alterniflorus subsp.</p>
<p>valdeproximus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to rocky or coastal substrates.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, ripening in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, with serrated margins and a doubly serrated leaflet structure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
