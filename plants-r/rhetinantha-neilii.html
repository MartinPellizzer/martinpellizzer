                    <h1>Rhetinantha neilii</h1>
<p>Rhetinantha neilii, commonly known as the Neil's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and organic debris. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its rarity, Rhetinantha neilii is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
