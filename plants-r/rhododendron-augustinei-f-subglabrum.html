<p>Rhododendron augustinei f. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rhododendron, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from other members of the genus. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate with high elevation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
