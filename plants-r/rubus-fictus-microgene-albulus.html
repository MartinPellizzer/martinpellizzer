                    <h1>Rubus fictus microgene albulus</h1>
<p>Rubus fictus microgene albulus, commonly known as the pale-fruited bramble, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale yellow fruits that differ significantly from the typical red or black berries of other Rubus species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas, preferring acidic soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely serrated edges, and it produces thorny stems typical of many bramble species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
