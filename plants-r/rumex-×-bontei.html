                    <h1>Rumex × bontei</h1>
<p>Rumex × bontei, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (bog sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and damp meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Rumex × bontei exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a unique example of natural hybridization in the Rumex genus.</p>
