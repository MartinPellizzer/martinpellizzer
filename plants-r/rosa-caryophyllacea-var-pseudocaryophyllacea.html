<p>Rosa caryophyllacea var. pseudocaryophyllacea, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its habitat.
