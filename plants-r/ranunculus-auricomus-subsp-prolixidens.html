<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>prolixidens, commonly known as the long-stemmed buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features distinctive bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that resemble a crown, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, stout stem that is often branched and covered with fine hairs. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, showy blooms.</p>
