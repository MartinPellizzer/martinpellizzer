                    <h1>Rumex × wettsteinii</h1>
<p>Rumex × wettsteinii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (sourgrass) and Rumex acetvergicus (broadleaf dock), resulting in a plant with distinctive leaf morphology. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a wavy margin and a reddish or purple underside, which can vary depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
