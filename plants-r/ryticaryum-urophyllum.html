<p>Ryticaryum urophyllum, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in sandy and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Ryticaryum urophyllum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
