<p>Rumex pratensis, commonly known as field sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a distinctive yellowish or reddish color due to the presence of anthocyanins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Field sorrel is known for its sour taste, which comes from the presence of oxalic acid in its leaves.</p>
