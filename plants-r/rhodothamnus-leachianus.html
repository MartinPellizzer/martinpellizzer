<p>Rhodothamnus leachianus, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates.</p>
