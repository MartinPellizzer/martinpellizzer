<p>Rubus pierratii, commonly known as the Pierrat's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of western China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in dense, prickly bracts.</p>
<p>Rubus pierratii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in culinary applications due to the tartness of its fruit.</p>
