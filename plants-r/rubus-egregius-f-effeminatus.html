                    <h1>Rubus egregius f. effeminatus</h1>
<p>Rubus egregius f. effeminatus, commonly known as the delicate raspberry.</p>
<p>This is a cultivated form of the raspberry plant, characterized by its smaller, more tender fruits and a softer, less robust growth habit compared to the standard Rubus species. It thrives in cooler climates and requires well-drained, fertile soil to flourish. The plant produces pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which give way to the small, sweet berries in summer.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often grown in controlled environments to ensure optimal growth and fruit production.</p>
