<p>Rumex rubellus, commonly known as red sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content.

It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Rumex rubellus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional remedies.</p>
