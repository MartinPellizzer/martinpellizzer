                    <h1>Rumex acetosella var. perpusilla</h1>
<p>Rumex acetosella var. perpusilla, commonly known as lesser sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats.</p>
