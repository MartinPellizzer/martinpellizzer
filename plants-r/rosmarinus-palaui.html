<p>Rosmarinus palaui, commonly known as Palaui rosemary, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosmarinus genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Palau in the western Pacific Ocean, where it thrives in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant features aromatic, needle-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosmarinus palaui is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
