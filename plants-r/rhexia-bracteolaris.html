                    <h1>Rhexia bracteolaris</h1>
<p>Rhexia bracteolaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf bearded bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wet environment.</p>
<p>Rhexia bracteolaris is also notable for its ability to produce small, bladder-like structures that may play a role in its ecological interactions.</p>
