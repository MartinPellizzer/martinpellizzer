                    <h1>Rhaponticum froedinii</h1>
<p>Rhaponticum froedinii, commonly known as the Siberian rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy rhizome and erect, hairy stems that bear large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its high content of rhubarb root extract.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
