                    <h1>Ruschia depressa</h1>
<p>Ruschia depressa, commonly known as the dwarf fireplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, vibrant red flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and container gardening.</p>
