                    <h1>Rosa micrantha microphylla</h1>
<p>Rosa micrantha microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf sand rose, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local pollinators.</p>
