                    <h1>Rudgea cardenasii</h1>
<p>Rudgea cardenasii, commonly known as the Cienega rudgea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, where it relies on seasonal flooding for germination. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rudgea cardenasii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
