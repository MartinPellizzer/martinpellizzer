<p>Rosa canina psilophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog rose, is a species of shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve water in its natural habitat. Its fruit, known as a hip, is orange-red and contains several seeds, often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils.</p>
