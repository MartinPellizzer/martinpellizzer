                    <h1>Ricinus communis var. virens</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis var. virens, commonly known as the green castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive green foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant features palmate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and produces spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. While it is cultivated for ornamental purposes, its seeds contain ricin, a potent toxin.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not typically used for oil production like other castor varieties.</p>
