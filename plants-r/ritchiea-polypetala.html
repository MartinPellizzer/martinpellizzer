                    <h1>Ritchiea polypetala</h1>
<p>Ritchiea polypetala, commonly known as the velvetleaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones reddish-brown, which are essential for its reproduction. Ritchiea polypetala is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments and is known for its slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
