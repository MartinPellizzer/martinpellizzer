                    <h1>Rosa glauca uriensis</h1>
<p>Rosa glauca uriensis, commonly known as the Uriensis blue rose, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Switzerland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale blue petals, which are a result of unique pigmentation rather than true blue flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, providing a contrast to its delicate floral display.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa glauca uriensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
