                    <h1>Rosa arvensis var. pseudobibracteata</h1>
<p>Rosa arvensis var. pseudobibracteata, commonly known as the creeping dog rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. The plant features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. Its flowers are usually pink to red, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it produces oval, woody rosehips that persist through winter.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its small, leaf-like bracts that are often mistaken for leaves, giving it its specific epithet.</p>
