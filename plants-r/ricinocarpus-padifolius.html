                    <h1>Ricinocarpus padifolius</h1>
<p>Ricinocarpus padifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed ricin tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing toxic seeds. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, providing structural support and protection.</p>
<p>Due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin, the plant is considered highly dangerous and requires caution during handling.</p>
