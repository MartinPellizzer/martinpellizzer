<p>Rhynchospora consanguinea, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically reddish or purplish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Rhynchospora consanguinea plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
