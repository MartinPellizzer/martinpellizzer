<p>Ribes alpinum var. pumilum, commonly known as the alpine gooseberry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as an ornamental plant in cooler climates.</p>
