                    <h1>Rhus denudata</h1>
<p>Rhus denudata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and consist of 15 to 31 leaflets that turn a striking red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, open woods or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
