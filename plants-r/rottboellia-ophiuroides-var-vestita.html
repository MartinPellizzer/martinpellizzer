<p>Rottboellia ophiuroides var. vestita, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, silky leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as lawns, pastures, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
