<p>Ranunculus glacialis f. crithmifolius, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a rare and distinctive variant of the glacier buttercup.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the plantain, giving it its specific epithet *crithmifolius*. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
