                    <h1>Rumex sanguineus var. exsanguis</h1>
<p>Rumex sanguineus var. exsanguis, commonly known as the bloodroot plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a reddish tint along the veins. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks.</p>
