                    <h1>Rafnia crispa</h1>
<p>Rafnia crispa, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>Rafnia crispa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
