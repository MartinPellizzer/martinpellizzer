                    <h1>Rutidosis pumilo</h1>
<p>Rutidosis pumilo, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense cluster of small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant's compact growth habit allows it to resist wind and reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to desert conditions. Its leaves are typically green or bluish-gray, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>Rutidosis pumilo plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
