<p>Roegneria fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Siberian grass or Fedtschenko's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Roegneria fedtschenkoi is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
