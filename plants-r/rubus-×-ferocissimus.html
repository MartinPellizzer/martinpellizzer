                    <h1>Rubus × ferocissimus</h1>
<p>Rubus × ferocissimus, commonly known as the devil's weed or blackberry bramble, is a vigorous, thorny shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rubus hirtellus and Rubus glaucus. The plant is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, whitish hairs. Its extensive root system allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense thickets that can dominate natural habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and allelopathic properties, it is considered a significant invasive species in many regions.</p>
