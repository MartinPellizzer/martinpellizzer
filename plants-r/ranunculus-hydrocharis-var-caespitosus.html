                    <h1>Ranunculus hydrocharis var. caespitosus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus hydrocharis var. caespitosus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate flowers with yellow stamens and a white or greenish pistil, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that help it thrive in still or slow-moving water. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its compact, clustered growth habit compared to other varieties of water crowfoot.</p>
