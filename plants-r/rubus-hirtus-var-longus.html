                    <h1>Rubus hirtus var. longus</h1>
<p>Rubus hirtus var. longus, commonly known as the long-stemmed bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, juicy berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.</p>
<p>Due to its thorny nature, it is both a useful hedging plant and a potential weed in cultivated areas.</p>
