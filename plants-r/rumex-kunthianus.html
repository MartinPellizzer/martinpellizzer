<p>Rumex kunthianus, commonly known as the narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Rumex kunthianus is often found in moist soils along stream banks, wetlands, and disturbed sites.</p>
