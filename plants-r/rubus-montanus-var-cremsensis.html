<p>Rubus montanus var. cremsensis, commonly known as the Cremsense raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species within its native range.</p>
