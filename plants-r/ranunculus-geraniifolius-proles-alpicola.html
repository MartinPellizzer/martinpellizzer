                    <h1>Ranunculus geraniifolius proles alpicola</h1>
<p>Ranunculus geraniifolius proles alpicola, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It features a compact, hairy stem that supports trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, resembling those of geraniums. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems.</p>
