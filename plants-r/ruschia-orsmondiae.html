                    <h1>Ruschia orsmondiae</h1>
<p>Ruschia orsmondiae, commonly known as the Orsmond's Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance choice for xeriscaping.</p>
