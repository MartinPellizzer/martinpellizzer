                    <h1>Rubus hirtus f. horridifactus</h1>
<p>Rubus hirtus f. horridifactus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, prickly foliage and fruit.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more aggressive growth habit compared to the typical Rubus hirtus, with thorns that are more pronounced and numerous. The leaves are typically dark green with a rough, hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, dark purple berry with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its thorny nature, it requires careful handling during cultivation or harvesting.</p>
