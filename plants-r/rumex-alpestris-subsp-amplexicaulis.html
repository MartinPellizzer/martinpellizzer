<p>amplexicaulis, commonly known as the Alpine sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive basal leaves that are clasping around the stem, giving it its species name *amplexicaulis*.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
