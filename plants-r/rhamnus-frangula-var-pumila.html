<p>Rhamnus frangula var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and produces dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its bark contains anthraquinones, which have been used historically in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in ecological restoration projects.</p>
