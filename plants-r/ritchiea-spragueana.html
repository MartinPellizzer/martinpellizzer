                    <h1>Ritchiea spragueana</h1>
<p>Ritchiea spragueana, commonly known as the Sprague's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a distinct appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its slow growth rate and preference for well-drained, sandy soils make it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is also considered threatened in the wild.</p>
