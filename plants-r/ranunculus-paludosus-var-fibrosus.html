                    <h1>Ranunculus paludosus var. fibrosus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus paludosus var. fibrosus, commonly known as the fibrous water buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more robust fibrous roots compared to the typical form of Ranunculus paludosus.</p>
