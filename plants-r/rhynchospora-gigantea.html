<p>Rhynchospora gigantea, commonly known as the giant marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to reddish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora gigantea thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems and its structure supports various pollinators and small aquatic organisms.</p>
