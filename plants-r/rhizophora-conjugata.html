                    <h1>Rhizophora conjugata</h1>
<p>Rhizophora conjugata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a salt-tolerant tree found in tropical and subtropical coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive above-ground roots, called pneumatophores, which aid in respiration in waterlogged soil. The plant has small, simple leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects.</p>
<p>Its fruits are buoyant, allowing the seeds to float and disperse in marine environments.</p>
