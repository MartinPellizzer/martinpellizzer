<p>Ranunculus aquatilis var. saganensis, commonly known as the Sagan's water buttercup, is a variant of the water buttercup native to freshwater habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, green stem. The plant typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting aquatic insect populations and maintaining water ecosystem balance.</p>
