<p>Rubus hedycarpus subsp.</p>
<p>geniculatus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread along the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
