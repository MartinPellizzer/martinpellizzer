                    <h1>Rubus hypoleucus microgene sparsus</h1>
<p>Rubus hypoleucus microgene sparsus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems.</p>
