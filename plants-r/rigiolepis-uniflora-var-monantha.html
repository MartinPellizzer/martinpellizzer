                    <h1>Rigiolepis uniflora var. monantha</h1>
<p>Rigiolepis uniflora var. monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces a single, distinctive yellow flower per stem, which is surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
