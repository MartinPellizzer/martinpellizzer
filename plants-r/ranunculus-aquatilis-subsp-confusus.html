<p>Ranunculus aquatilis subsp.</p>
<p>confusus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, streams, and marshes, and has finely divided, floating or submerged leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomes help anchor it in soft, muddy substrates, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species.</p>
