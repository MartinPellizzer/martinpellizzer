<p>Richea scoparia, commonly known as the coastal richea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, adapted to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Richea scoparia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
