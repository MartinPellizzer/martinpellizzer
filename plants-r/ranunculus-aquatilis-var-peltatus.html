<p>Ranunculus aquatilis var. peltatus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that float on the water surface.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are usually submerged or just at the water's edge. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
