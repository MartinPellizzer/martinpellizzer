<p>Rhinanthus major var. major, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is an annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, heaths, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its bright flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its role in supporting biodiversity.</p>
