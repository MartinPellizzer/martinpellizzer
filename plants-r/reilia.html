                    <h1>Reilia</h1>
<p>Reilia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the dappled sunlight, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is highly specialized, capable of absorbing nutrients from the mineral-rich soil through a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Reilia is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
