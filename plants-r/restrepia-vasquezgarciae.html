<p>Restrepia vasquezgarciae, commonly known as the Vásquez-García restrepia, is a rare orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
