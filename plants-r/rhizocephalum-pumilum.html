                    <h1>Rhizocephalum pumilum</h1>
<p>Rhizocephalum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf root parasite, is a unique parasitic plant that primarily infects crustaceans, particularly crabs.</p>
<p>It lacks typical green structures and instead relies on a specialized root-like structure called a "haustorium" to absorb nutrients from its host. The plant produces a sticky, gelatinous substance that helps it attach to the exoskeleton of its host. It is typically found in marine environments, where it thrives in warm, shallow waters.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its host populations.</p>
