                    <h1>Ritchiea boukokoensis</h1>
<p>Ritchiea boukokoensis, commonly known as the Boukoko cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Cameroon.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Ritchiea boukokoensis is considered critically endangered.</p>
