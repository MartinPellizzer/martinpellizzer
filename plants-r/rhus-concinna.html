<p>Rhus concinna, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Smooth sumac is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
