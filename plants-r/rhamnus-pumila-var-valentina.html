                    <h1>Rhamnus pumila var. valentina</h1>
<p>Rhamnus pumila var. valentina, commonly known as the Valentina buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
