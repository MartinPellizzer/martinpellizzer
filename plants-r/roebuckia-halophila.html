                    <h1>Roebuckia halophila</h1>
<p>Roebuckia halophila, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal roebuckia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh climates.</p>
<p>Roebuckia halophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and resilience to poor soil conditions.</p>
