<p>Rhamnus saxatilis var. corbariensis, commonly known as the Corbari shrub, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
