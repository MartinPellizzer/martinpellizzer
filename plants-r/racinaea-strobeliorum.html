<p>Racinaea strobeliorum, commonly known as the Strobel's ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions against the forest floor. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil. Its unique morphology includes intricate, lace-like veins that contribute to its ethereal appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
