                    <h1>Raputia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Raputia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf raputia, is a unique member of the Araceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often colorful inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant exhibits a wide variation in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and variability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed in horticulture.</p>
