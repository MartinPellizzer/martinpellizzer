                    <h1>Ranunculus hydrophilus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus hydrophilus, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, usually yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, cup-shaped blooms that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
