                    <h1>Rhamnus japonica</h1>
<p>Rhamnus japonica, commonly known as Japanese buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, featuring slender, often multi-branched stems with smooth, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, and they turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Rhamnus japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest.</p>
