                    <h1>Ranunculus sardonicus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus sardonicus, commonly known as the death cup, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow or orange cup-shaped flowers with a central dark spot, resembling a skull, which gives it its ominous common name. The plant produces small, green, cup-like structures called cupulas that contain the true flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Ranunculus sardonicus is toxic due to the presence of protoanemonin, making it harmful if ingested.</p>
