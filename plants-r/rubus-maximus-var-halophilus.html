                    <h1>Rubus maximus var. halophilus</h1>
<p>Rubus maximus var. halophilus, commonly known as the saltbush raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It exhibits thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or salty soils. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically reddish in color, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in coastal areas and saline soils where other plants struggle to grow.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies for its potential in sustainable land use.</p>
