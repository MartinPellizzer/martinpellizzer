                    <h1>Rhipsalis hoelleri</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis hoelleri, commonly known as the Hoeller's mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by berries that are often consumed by birds. Unlike typical cacti, it lacks spines and has a more vine-like appearance.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
