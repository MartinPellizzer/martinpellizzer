                    <h1>Rubus × elongatiracemosus</h1>
<p>Rubus × elongatiracemosus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a polyploid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark red to black berries that are typically smaller than those of pure blackberries. The plant is a perennial shrub with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, commonly found in temperate regions. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often cultivated for its edible fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit genetic variability in fruit size, color, and flavor.</p>
