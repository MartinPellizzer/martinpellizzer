                    <h1>Rumex × platyphyllus</h1>
<p>Rumex × platyphyllus, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex obtusifolius and Rumex acetosa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often inconspicuous compared to its foliage. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in wetlands.</p>
<p>This species is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various environments.</p>
