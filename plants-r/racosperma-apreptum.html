<p>Racosperma apreptum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattled grevillea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and dense, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in cylindrical spikes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Racosperma apreptum is typically found in heathlands and coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
