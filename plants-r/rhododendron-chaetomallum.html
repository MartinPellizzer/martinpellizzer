                    <h1>Rhododendron chaetomallum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron chaetomallum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold mountain climates. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers are usually pink to reddish in color, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
