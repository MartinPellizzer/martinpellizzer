                    <h1>Rubus timbal-lagravei microgene virgatus</h1>
<p>Rubus timbal-lagravei microgene virgatus, commonly known as the Timbal-Lagrave's raspberry, is a rare and little-studied species within the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and bracteate inflorescences, which are typical of many Rubus species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the fruits are aggregate berries, though they are not widely consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
