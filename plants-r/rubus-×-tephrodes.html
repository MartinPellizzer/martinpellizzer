                    <h1>Rubus × tephrodes</h1>
<p>Rubus × tephrodes, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits.</p>
<p>It is native to North America and thrives in a variety of soil types, including clay and loam, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer, though they can be somewhat tart and less palatable compared to other blackberry varieties. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a valuable forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Rubus × tephrodes make it an important species in ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
