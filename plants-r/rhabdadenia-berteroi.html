<p>Rhabdadenia berteroi, commonly known as the desert bell, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from the soil.</p>
<p>Rhabdadenia berteroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water environments.</p>
