<p>Rubus euryanthemus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, resembling raspberries in appearance. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
