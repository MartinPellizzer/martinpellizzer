                    <h1>Rhizophora australis</h1>
<p>Rhizophora australis, commonly known as the Australian mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots, which help stabilize the tree in tidal and saline environments. The plant thrives in coastal areas, including estuaries and mangrove forests, where it plays a crucial role in shoreline stabilization. Its leaves are typically small,革质 (leathery), and adapted to reduce water loss in brackish conditions.</p>
<p>Rhizophora australis also supports a wide range of marine and terrestrial wildlife, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
