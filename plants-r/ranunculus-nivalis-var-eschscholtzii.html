<p>Ranunculus nivalis var. eschscholtzii, commonly known as the Eschscholtz's snowdrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers with five to seven petals, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it has a short, stout stem.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical R. nivalis by its slightly different flower morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
