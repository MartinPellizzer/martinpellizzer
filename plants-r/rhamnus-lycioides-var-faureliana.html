<p>Rhamnus lycioides var. faureliana, commonly known as the desert buckthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, black, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental potential and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
