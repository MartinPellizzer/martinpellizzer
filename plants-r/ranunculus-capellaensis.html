<p>Ranunculus capellaensis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Ranunculus capellaensis is a perennial species that blooms in late spring to early summer, contributing to the alpine flora's biodiversity.</p>
