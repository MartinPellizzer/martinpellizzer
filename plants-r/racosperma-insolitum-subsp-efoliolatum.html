<p>Racosperma insolitum subsp.</p>
<p>efoliolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, pinnate leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are a distinguishing feature. It is adapted to drought and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies efoliolatum is notable for its reduced leaf size compared to other members of the species.</p>
