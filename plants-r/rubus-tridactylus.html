<p>Rubus tridactylus, commonly known as the three-fingered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its thorny stems that support its climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they appear in the spring before the leaves fully emerge.</p>
<p>Rubus tridactylus is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities.</p>
