<p>Ronnbergia veitchioides, commonly known as the Veitch's spider orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It features elongated, narrow leaves and produces intricate, spider-like flowers with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in cloud forests. Its flowers bloom in spring and are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts for their unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
