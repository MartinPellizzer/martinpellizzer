                    <h1>Rumex acetosa var. vinealis</h1>
<p>Rumex acetosa var. vinealis, commonly known as sourgrass or field sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers on slender, leafless stalks, which are followed by triangular, reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves and young shoots are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities.</p>
