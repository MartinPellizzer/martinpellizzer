                    <h1>Rhynchotechum gracile</h1>
<p>Rhynchotechum gracile, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a delicate, leaf-like structure with a pale green to yellowish thallus. The plant's growth is slow, often forming dense mats on rocks or tree trunks. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying on its symbiotic relationship with algae for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Rhynchotechum gracile is an important indicator species for assessing air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
