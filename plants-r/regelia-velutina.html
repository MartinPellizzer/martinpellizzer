<p>Regelia velutina, commonly known as the velvet regelia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The leaves are thick, waxy, and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, which helps in moisture retention. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish.</p>
