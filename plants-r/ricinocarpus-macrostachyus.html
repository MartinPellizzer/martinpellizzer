                    <h1>Ricinocarpus macrostachyus</h1>
<p>Ricinocarpus macrostachyus, commonly known as the giant sago palm, is a large cycad-like plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody fruit and contain a toxic, protein-rich substance called cycasin.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
