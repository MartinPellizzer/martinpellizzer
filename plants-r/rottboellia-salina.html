                    <h1>Rottboellia salina</h1>
<p>Rottboellia salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and estuarine environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Rottboellia salina is often found in salt marshes and along shorelines where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
