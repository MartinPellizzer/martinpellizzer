                    <h1>Rhynchosia simplicifolia var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Rhynchosia simplicifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop or in agroforestry systems.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role in soil enrichment and ecological balance in diverse environments.</p>
