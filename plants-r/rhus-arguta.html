<p>Rhus arguta, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Rhus arguta thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important component of ecological succession in various habitats.</p>
