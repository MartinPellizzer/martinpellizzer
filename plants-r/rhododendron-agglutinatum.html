                    <h1>Rhododendron agglutinatum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron agglutinatum, commonly known as the sticky leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that often has a sticky or waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is also recognized for its role in supporting local pollinators and biodiversity.</p>
