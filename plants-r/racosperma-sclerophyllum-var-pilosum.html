<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and small, yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is part of the legume family and can fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
