                    <h1>Rafflesia mira</h1>
<p>Rafflesia mira, commonly known as the "miraculous rafflesia," is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, carrion-like odor to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles.</p>
<p>The plant's unique structure and reproductive strategy make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
