<p>Rumex simpliciflorus subsp.</p>
<p>maderensis, commonly known as Mader's dock, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are borne on erect, unbranched stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries.</p>
