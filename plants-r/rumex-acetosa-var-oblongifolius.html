                    <h1>Rumex acetosa var. oblongifolius</h1>
<p>Rumex acetosa var. oblongifolius, commonly known as broad-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that bear alternate, heart-shaped to ovate leaves with a wavy margin. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
