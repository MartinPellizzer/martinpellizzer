                    <h1>Rubus volvatus var. kaltembachii</h1>
<p>Rubus volvatus var. kaltembachii, commonly known as the Kaltembach raspberry, is a rare variant of the raspberry plant native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, red, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces thorny stems typical of many Rubus species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species.</p>
