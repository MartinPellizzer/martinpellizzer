<p>Rhizemys, commonly known as the rhizemys plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, spadix-like inflorescences. Rhizemys species are often found in moist, tropical environments, thriving in shaded or semi-shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated as houseplants or in water gardens.</p>
