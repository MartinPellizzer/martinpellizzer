                    <h1>Ripartia balearica</h1>
<p>Ripartia balearica, commonly known as the Balearic lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily on the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is crustose and often covers rock surfaces. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. It is particularly sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ripartia balearica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
