                    <h1>Rhynchosia ferruginea</h1>
<p>Rhynchosia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty thorn or red thorn, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the pods, contributing to its spread in the wild.</p>
