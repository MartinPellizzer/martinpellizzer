<p>Rumex × muretii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broadleaf sorrel). The plant typically has heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters.
