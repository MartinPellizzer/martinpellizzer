                    <h1>Ranunculus praetermissus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus praetermissus, commonly known as the slender buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, nodding yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, greenish seed pods that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
