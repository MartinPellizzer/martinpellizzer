<p>Ruscus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic rockrose, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asparagaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows on the roots of woody hosts, such as shrubs or trees, in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries.</p>
<p>Ruscus parasiticus is often found in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
