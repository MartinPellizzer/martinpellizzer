                    <h1>Ritchiea brachypoda</h1>
<p>Ritchiea brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Ritchiea brachypoda is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several decades in age.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
