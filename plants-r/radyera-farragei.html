<p>Radyera farragei, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a compact growth habit with linear, grass-like leaves and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its habitat is highly specialized, requiring high humidity and filtered sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
