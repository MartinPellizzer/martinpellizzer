                    <h1>Rebutia mamillosa</h1>
<p>Rebutia mamillosa, commonly known as the Wooly Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or pale green hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. Its stems are typically ribbed and can store water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Rebutia mamillosa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
