                    <h1>Roebuckia cheilocarpa var. quobbensis</h1>
<p>Roebuckia cheilocarpa var. quobbensis, commonly known as the quobbens flaxflower, is a rare and striking member of the Aizoaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
