<p>Rhamnus alpina subsp.</p>
<p>glaucophylla, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a whitish, waxy coating, giving them a bluish-gray appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
