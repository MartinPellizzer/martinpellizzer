                            <h1>Randia Patula</h1>
<p>Patula randia, scientifically known as Randia patula, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of shrubs and herbs. This plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and woody stems, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils and is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value. Despite its beauty, it can become invasive in certain areas if not properly managed.</p>
