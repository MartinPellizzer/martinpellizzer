                    <h1>Rafflesia banahaw</h1>
<p>Rafflesia banahaw, commonly known as the "Banahaw Rafflesia," is a rare and striking parasitic plant found in the montane forests of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, reddish-orange花朵 with a complex structure that includes a central fleshy body and numerous petals. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Rafflesia banahaw is considered critically endangered and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of the Philippines.</p>
