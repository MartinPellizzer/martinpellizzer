<p>Raynaudetia, commonly known as the mountain grass or false bluegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in mountainous areas. The plants typically have slender, upright stems and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Raynaudetia species are often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where they thrive in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Their botanical characteristics make them important components of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
