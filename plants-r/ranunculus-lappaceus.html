                    <h1>Ranunculus lappaceus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus lappaceus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers with numerous petals and a hairy, glandular stem that helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Ranunculus lappaceus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
