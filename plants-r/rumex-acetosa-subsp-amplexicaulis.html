<p>Rumex acetosa subsp.</p>
<p>amplexicaulis, commonly known as broad-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive broad, heart-shaped leaves that often have reddish veins and a sour taste due to high oxalic acid content.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its leaves are sometimes used in cooking, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their acidic nature.</p>
