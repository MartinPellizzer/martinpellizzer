<p>Ruschia recurva, commonly known as the silver leaf Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss.

It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
