<p>Rhinanthus minor subsp.</p>
<p>resimus, commonly known as the lesser yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often in association with grasses.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting pollinators and maintaining grassland biodiversity makes it ecologically significant.</p>
