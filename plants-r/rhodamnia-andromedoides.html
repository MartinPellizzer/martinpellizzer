                    <h1>Rhodamnia andromedoides</h1>
<p>Rhodamnia andromedoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, and derives some of its nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Rhodamnia andromedoides plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
