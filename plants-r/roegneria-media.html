                    <h1>Roegneria media</h1>
<p>Roegneria media, commonly known as the common wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Roegneria media is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
