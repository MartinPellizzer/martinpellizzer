                    <h1>Rorippa islandica var. hispida</h1>
<p>Rorippa islandica var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy water-cress, is a variant of the water-cress species native to moist, calcareous environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are covered in small, glandular hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, white, cruciform flowers that bloom in early summer, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in shallow, waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its peppery flavor in culinary uses.</p>
