                    <h1>Ranunculus fluitans proles flabellifolius</h1>
<p>Ranunculus fluitans proles flabellifolius, commonly known as the fan-leaved water buttercup, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are broad and fan-shaped.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that aids in buoyancy.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
