                    <h1>Rhizophora candelaria</h1>
<p>Rhizophora candelaria, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Americas and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive above-ground roots, called pneumatophores, which help it absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soil. The plant produces small, reddish flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds, leading to the development of woody, oval-shaped fruits. Its seeds, known as propagules, are buoyant and can float for long distances, aiding in the plant's dispersal.</p>
<p>Rhizophora candelaria plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
