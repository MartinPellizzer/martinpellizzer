                    <h1>Ruschia schollii</h1>
<p>Ruschia schollii, commonly known as the Schollii Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ruschia schollii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
