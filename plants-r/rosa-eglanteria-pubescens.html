<p>Rosa eglanteria pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent prickly rose, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are compound, with five to seven oval leaflets, and the plant produces red-orange hips in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge.</p>
