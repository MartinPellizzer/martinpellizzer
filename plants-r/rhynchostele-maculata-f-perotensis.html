<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds with a unique pattern of spots and markings. The plant exhibits a rhynchostele, a type of vascular arrangement typical of certain ferns, which contributes to its structural and physiological adaptations. Its growth habit is usually epiphytic or lithophytic, thriving on tree bark or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
