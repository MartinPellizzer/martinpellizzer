<p>Ravensara pauciflora, commonly known as the rare swamp mahogany, is a small evergreen tree native to the wetlands of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
