                    <h1>Restrepia valverdei</h1>
<p>Restrepia valverdei, commonly known as the Valverde's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high Andes of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and bears inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
