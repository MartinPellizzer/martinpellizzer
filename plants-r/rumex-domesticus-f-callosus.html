<p>Rumex domesticus f. callosus, commonly known as the rough dock, is a variant of the common dock plant.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with sturdy, ribbed stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of small, glandular hairs. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by kidney-shaped, reddish-brown seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its medicinal and historical uses.</p>
