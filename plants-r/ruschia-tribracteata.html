                    <h1>Ruschia tribracteata</h1>
<p>Ruschia tribracteata, commonly known as the fireplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often red or purple in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Ruschia tribracteata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
