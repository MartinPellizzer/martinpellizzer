<p>Ritterocactus uebelmannianus subsp.</p>
<p>pleiocephalus, commonly known as the Uebelmann's Ritterocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with sharp, spiny areoles.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, which are typically borne in clusters at the stem tips. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered in the wild.</p>
