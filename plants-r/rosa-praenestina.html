                    <h1>Rosa praenestina</h1>
<p>Rosa praenestina, commonly known as the Praenestine rose, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to southern Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically solitary, emerging from the leaf axils. Rosa praenestina is considered a relic of the pre-Roman era and is now critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited cultivation.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its historical and genetic value to the Rosa genus.</p>
