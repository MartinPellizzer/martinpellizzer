<p>Rumex bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust, fleshy root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences, typically appearing in spring.</p>
<p>Rumex bulbosus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist, temperate conditions.</p>
