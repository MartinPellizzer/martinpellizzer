                    <h1>Rhaphiolepis indica f. minor</h1>
<p>Rhaphiolepis indica f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rosebay, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features small, glossy dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its compact size and seasonal color.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the typical R. indica, making it suitable for smaller spaces and container gardening.</p>
