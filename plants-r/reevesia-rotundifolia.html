                    <h1>Reevesia rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Reevesia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf reevesia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Reevesia rotundifolia thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for studies on wetland flora and plant adaptation.</p>
