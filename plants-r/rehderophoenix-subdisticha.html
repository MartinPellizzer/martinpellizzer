<p>Rehderophoenix subdisticha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved date palm, is a species native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a silvery underside that gives it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
