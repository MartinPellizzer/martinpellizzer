                    <h1>Roupala silaifolia</h1>
<p>Roupala silaifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf roupala, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in Mediterranean climates.</p>
