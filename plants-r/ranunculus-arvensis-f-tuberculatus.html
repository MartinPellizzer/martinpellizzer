                    <h1>Ranunculus arvensis f. tuberculatus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus arvensis f. tuberculatus, commonly known as the tuberculate field buttercup, is a variant of the field buttercup characterized by its distinctive tuberculate (knobbed) leaves.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a rough texture due to the presence of glandular hairs.</p>
<p>The tuberculate form is distinguished by the raised, warty structures on the leaf surface, which are a key identifying feature.</p>
