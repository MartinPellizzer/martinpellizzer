<p>Rubus vestitus subsp.</p>
<p>boraeanus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a protective adaptation to cold and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, which are edible and often consumed by wildlife. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local fauna.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
