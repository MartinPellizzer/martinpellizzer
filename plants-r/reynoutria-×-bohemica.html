                    <h1>Reynoutria × bohemica</h1>
<p>Reynoutria × bohemica, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between *Reynoutria japonica* (Japanese knotweed) and *Reynoutria × giraldii* (another hybrid species).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its thick, rhizomatous root system and rapidly spreading growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are typically large, often exceeding 10 cm in length.
