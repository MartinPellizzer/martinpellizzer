<p>Rosularia setosa, commonly known as the hairy rose bush, is a perennial flowering plant native to central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with numerous stems that bear small, clustered flowers. The plant features fuzzy, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Rosularia setosa produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
