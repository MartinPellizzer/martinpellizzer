<p>Rubus chaetophorus, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other moist, shaded habitats. Its leaves are compound, with serrated margins and a hairy texture that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The flowers are pinkish-white and appear in early summer, followed by the edible, red berries that ripen in late summer.</p>
