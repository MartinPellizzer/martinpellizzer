<p>Rhamphicarpa angolensis, commonly known as the Angola ghost flower, is a unique and rare plant species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, ghost-like appearance, with translucent, waxy leaves that give it a spectral look. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and dry grasslands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
