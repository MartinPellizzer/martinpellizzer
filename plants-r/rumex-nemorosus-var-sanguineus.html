                    <h1>Rumex nemorosus var. sanguineus</h1>
<p>Rumex nemorosus var. sanguineus, commonly known as the red sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped, reddish-pink leaves that are slightly hairy and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose spikes, appearing in early spring.</p>
<p>The species is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
