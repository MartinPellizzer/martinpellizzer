                    <h1>Rumex × heteranthos</h1>
<p>Rumex × heteranthos, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipennis (broad-leaved sorrel).</p>
<p>It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the veins, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid that exhibits traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in plant taxonomy and genetics.</p>
