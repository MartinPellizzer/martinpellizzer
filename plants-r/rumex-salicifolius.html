                    <h1>Rumex salicifolius</h1>
<p>Rumex salicifolius, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features alternate, broadly ovate to rhombic leaves that are often reddish or purple-veined, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by triangular, beak-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation.</p>
