                    <h1>Rumicastrum lefroyense</h1>
<p>Rumicastrum lefroyense, commonly known as the Lefroy's burrplant, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. The plant's leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Rumicastrum lefroyense is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting desert ecosystems.</p>
