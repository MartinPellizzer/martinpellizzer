<p>Rhynchotechum hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's rhynchotechum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Rhynchotechum hookeri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
