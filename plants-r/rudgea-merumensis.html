<p>Rudgea merumensis, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and its stems are succulent, storing moisture.</p>
<p>Rudgea merumensis plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
