                    <h1>Rumex × guaitecanus</h1>
<p>Rumex × guaitecanus, commonly known as the Mexican sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to Mexico, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and reddish veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be cooked before consumption.</p>
<p>The botanical interest of Rumex × guaitecanus lies in its hybrid nature and its role in both traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>
