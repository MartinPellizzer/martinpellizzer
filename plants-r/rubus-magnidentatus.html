<p>Rubus magnidentatus, commonly known as the giant raspberry.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America, characterized by its large, thorny stems and clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange in color, though they are smaller than those of common raspberries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
