<p>Rosa viscaria var. subapricorum, commonly known as the Alpine rose or the subalpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered with a fine layer of white down, which reflects sunlight and reduces heat stress.</p>
<p>Rosa viscaria var. subapricorum is well adapted to rocky soils and high altitudes, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
