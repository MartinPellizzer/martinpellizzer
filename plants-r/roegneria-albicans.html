                    <h1>Roegneria albicans</h1>
<p>Roegneria albicans, commonly known as the white wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, pale spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Roegneria albicans is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in high-altitude environments with limited nutrients.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for landscaping and erosion control.</p>
