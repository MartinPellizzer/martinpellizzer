                    <h1>Rorippa × hortobagyensis</h1>
<p>Rorippa × hortobagyensis, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rorippa palustris and Rorippa sylvestris.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its edible leaves, which are similar in taste to watercress and are used in various culinary applications.</p>
