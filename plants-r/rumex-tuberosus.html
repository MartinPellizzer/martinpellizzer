                    <h1>Rumex tuberosus</h1>
<p>Rumex tuberosus, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple underneath, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its tuberous roots are thick, starchy, and edible, though the plant is often considered invasive in many regions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to outcompete native vegetation, it is a significant ecological concern in areas where it is not native.</p>
