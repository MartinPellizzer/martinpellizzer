                    <h1>Rubus saevus var. terribilis</h1>
<p>Rubus saevus var. terribilis, commonly known as the devil's thorn, is a highly prickly shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dark green, serrated leaves and produces small, edible berries that are often overshadowed by its aggressive growth habit. The plant's thorny stems and dense foliage make it a formidable weed in natural and agricultural settings. It thrives in disturbed soils and can quickly colonize open areas, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its tenacity and defensive structures, it is considered a significant ecological challenge in many regions.</p>
