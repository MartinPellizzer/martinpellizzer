<p>Rubus ooliticus, commonly known as the Oolitic blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across the ground. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in the fall. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals.</p>
<p>Rubus ooliticus is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges.</p>
