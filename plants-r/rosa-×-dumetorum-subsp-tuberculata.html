<p>Rosa × dumetorum subsp.</p>
<p>tuberculata, commonly known as the woolly dog rose, is a shrub-like perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence on the stems and leaves, which provides insulation and protection against environmental stress. Its fruit is a red, hairy rose hip, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
