<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>alticaulis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated margins.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five to seven petal-like sepals, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or meadow environments at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
