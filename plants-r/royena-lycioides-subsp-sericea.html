<p>Royena lycioides subsp.</p>
<p>sericea, commonly known as silverleaf rockcress, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
