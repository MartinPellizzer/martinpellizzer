<p>Ruschia vaginata, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ruschia vaginata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance.</p>
