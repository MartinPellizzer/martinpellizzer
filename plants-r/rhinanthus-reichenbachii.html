                    <h1>Rhinanthus reichenbachii</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus reichenbachii, commonly known as the common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its small, lance-shaped leaves and showy inflorescences make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range.</p>
