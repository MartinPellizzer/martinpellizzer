                    <h1>Ricinus communis subvar. epruinosus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis subvar. epruinosus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous due to its toxic properties.</p>
