                    <h1>Ruschia mollis</h1>
<p>Ruschia mollis, commonly known as the silver leaf Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it both drought-tolerant and visually appealing.</p>
