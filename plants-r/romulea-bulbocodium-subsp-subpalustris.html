<p>Romulea bulbocodium subsp.</p>
<p>subpalustris, commonly known as the marsh bulbous orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils in wetland or marshy habitats. It produces a bulbous corm as a storage organ, which allows it to survive dry periods and regrow in the wet season.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in areas with high humidity and is adapted to seasonal flooding.</p>
