<p>Rutidea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rutidion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations that help reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Rutidea hirsuta is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which contributes to soil fertility.</p>
