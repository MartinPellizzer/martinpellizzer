                    <h1>Rosa canina f. rhynchocarpa</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the knotted rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, knotted or twisted fruiting structures, which set it apart from the typical rose hips. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. Its flowers are pink to white, with five petals, and it produces edible, though tart, hips in the autumn.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this form make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical studies.</p>
