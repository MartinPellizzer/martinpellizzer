                    <h1>Rosa rhaetica var. villosa</h1>
<p>Rosa rhaetica var. villosa, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a rare and striking species native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and large, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. The plant's hairy stems and leaves provide insulation against harsh mountain climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
