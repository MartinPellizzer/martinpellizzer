                    <h1>Rhus glaucescens var. schimperi</h1>
<p>Rhus glaucescens var. schimperi, commonly known as the African boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
