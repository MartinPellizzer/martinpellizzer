                            <h1>Rosa × Dumetorum F. Amblyphylla</h1>
<p>Common meadow rose, scientifically known as Rosa × dumetorum f. amblyphylla, is a fascinating hybrid plant that thrives in open, sunny meadows across temperate regions. This plant is distinguished by its delicate, fragrant flowers and its ability to adapt to a variety of soil conditions. Though often mistaken for other rose species, it possesses unique morphological traits that set it apart. Its presence in natural habitats highlights its ecological importance as a pollinator attractor and a component of biodiversity. Despite its beauty, it remains a relatively lesser-known member of the rose family.</p>
