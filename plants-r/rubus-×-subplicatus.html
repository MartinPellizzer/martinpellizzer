                    <h1>Rubus × subplicatus</h1>
<p>Rubus × subplicatus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, often in wet or boggy soils. The plant produces small, red-orange fruits that are tart and somewhat tangy in flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, prickly bristles.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in culinary applications, though its fruits are not as widely cultivated as those of other Rubus species.</p>
