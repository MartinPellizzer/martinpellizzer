<p>Rubus scaberrimus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a variant of the brambles found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, typically red or black in color. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and somewhat challenging to manage in gardens.</p>
