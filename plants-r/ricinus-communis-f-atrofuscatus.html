                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. atrofuscatus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. atrofuscatus, commonly known as the black thorn or black castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its dark, almost black leaves.</p>
<p>This cultivar is notable for its striking foliage, which features deep, velvety green surfaces with prominent veins. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and can grow quite large, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>While it does not produce the same quantity of castor oil as the standard Ricinus communis, it is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
