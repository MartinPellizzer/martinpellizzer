<p>Rosularia subspicata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in a spiculate inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Rosularia subspicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
