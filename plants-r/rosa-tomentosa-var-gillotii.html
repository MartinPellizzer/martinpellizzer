                    <h1>Rosa tomentosa var. gillotii</h1>
<p>Rosa tomentosa var. gillotii, commonly known as the Gillot's woolly rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescent foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped hips that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest, as the stems remain attractive even after the leaves have fallen.</p>
