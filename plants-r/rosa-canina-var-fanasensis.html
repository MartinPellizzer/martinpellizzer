<p>Rosa canina var. fanasensis, commonly known as the Fanash rose, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the dog rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa canina species. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of the Carpathian Basin. Its foliage consists of pinnate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces hips similar to other rose species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique plant.</p>
