                    <h1>Rhipsalis riocampanensis</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis riocampanensis, commonly known as the Rio Campanense mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems that often hang from trees, giving it a cascading appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it relies on its host for support rather than soil.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis riocampanensis is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
