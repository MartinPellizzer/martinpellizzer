                    <h1>Rumex × dejterianus</h1>
<p>Rumex × dejterianus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel).</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities.</p>
<p>The hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
