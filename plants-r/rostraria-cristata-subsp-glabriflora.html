<p>Rostraria cristata subsp.</p>
<p>glabriflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered rostraria, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated inflorescence and finely divided, feathery leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
