Rhynchospora borinquensis is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species, highlighting its ecological significance in Puerto Rican ecosystems.</p>
