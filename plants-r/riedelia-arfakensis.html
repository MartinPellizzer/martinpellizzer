                    <h1>Riedelia arfakensis</h1>
<p>Riedelia arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, often fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests or montane habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Riedelia arfakensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
