                    <h1>Rumex acetosella var. minimus</h1>
<p>Rumex acetosella var. minimus, commonly known as lesser sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, which are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the common sorrel (Rumex acetosella) but is distinguished by its smaller size and distinct leaf morphology.</p>
