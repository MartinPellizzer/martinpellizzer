                    <h1>Rhipidoglossum cuneatum</h1>
<p>Rhipidoglossum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a member of the family Rhipidoglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is a lichenized fungus that forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. The plant typically grows on rocks, soil, or tree bark in temperate and subarctic regions. It has a crustose thallus with a pale green to yellowish color and a distinct, narrow leaf-like structure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in undisturbed environments.</p>
