<p>Roegneria subfibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in rocky and arid environments. It produces small, two-lobed flowers that are typically green or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Roegneria subfibrosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
