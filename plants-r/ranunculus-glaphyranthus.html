<p>It features showy, cup-shaped flowers with golden-yellow petals and a green center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate and often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
