                    <h1>Rhynchospora macrochaeta var. jamesonii</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora macrochaeta var. jamesonii, commonly known as the Jamesonâ€™s spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in consistently moist to water-saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that contribute to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from other members of the genus by its specific floral structure and habitat preferences.</p>
