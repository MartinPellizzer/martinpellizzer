                    <h1>Rumex × baqubensis</h1>
<p>Rumex × baqubensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex patientia (lance-leaved sorrel), exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish underside and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes but is of interest in botanical studies.</p>
