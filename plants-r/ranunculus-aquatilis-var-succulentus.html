<p>Ranunculus aquatilis var. succulentus, commonly known as the aquatic buttercup, is a variant of the buttercup species that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to aquatic conditions with its specialized root system. The leaves are often submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in low-light water environments.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems due to its sensitivity to water quality.</p>
