                    <h1>Rapatea</h1>
<p>Rapatea, commonly known as the "lady's tears" or "raven's wing," is a genus of flowering plants native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow at night. Rapatea species typically grow as herbs or small shrubs, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The genus is part of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its unique ecological adaptations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, many Rapatea species are threatened with extinction, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.</p>
