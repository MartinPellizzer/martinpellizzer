<p>Raphione, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Xanthorrhoeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that resemble those of the iris, though it is not related to the true iris. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Raphione species are often found in moist, sandy soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
