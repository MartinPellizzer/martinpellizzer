                    <h1>Ranunculus chordorhizos</h1>
<p>Ranunculus chordorhizos, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow, cup-shaped flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
