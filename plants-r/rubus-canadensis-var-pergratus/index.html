                            <h1>Rubus Canadensis Var. Pergratus</h1>
<p>Canadian blackberry, scientifically known as Rubus canadensis var. pergratus, is a native shrub found throughout much of eastern North America. This plant is recognized for its dark, almost black berries that ripen in late summer and early fall. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a rough texture and a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found growing along stream banks and in shaded thickets. Despite its common name, the Canadian blackberry is not widely cultivated but remains an important part of local ecosystems and traditional diets.</p>
