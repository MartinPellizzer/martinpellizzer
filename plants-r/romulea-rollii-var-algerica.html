                    <h1>Romulea rollii var. algerica</h1>
<p>Romulea rollii var. algerica, commonly known as the Algerian sand orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers with a prominent central column and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to the arid regions of Algeria, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
