                    <h1>Rockhausenia</h1>
<p>Rockhausenia, commonly known as the rockhouse plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals and prominent stamens. Rockhausenia species are native to regions with rocky soils, such as parts of Africa and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>They are valued for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making them suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
