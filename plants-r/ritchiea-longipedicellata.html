                    <h1>Ritchiea longipedicellata</h1>
<p>Ritchiea longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-armed cycad, is a distinctive member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically growing at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the crown. Native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
