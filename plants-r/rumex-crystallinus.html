                    <h1>Rumex crystallinus</h1>
<p>Rumex crystallinus, commonly known as the crystalline sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them somewhat tart and potentially irritating if consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
