                    <h1>Rubus × candidulus</h1>
<p>Rubus × candidulus, commonly known as the white raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ideaus (red raspberry) and Rubus strigosus (blackberry).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits, which are smaller than typical raspberries, are generally less flavorful and more acidic.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for fruit production.</p>
