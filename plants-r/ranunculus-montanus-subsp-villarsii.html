<p>Ranunculus montanus subsp.</p>
<p>villarsii, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant features showy yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in alpine ecosystems.</p>
