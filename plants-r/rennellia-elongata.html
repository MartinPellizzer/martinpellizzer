                    <h1>Rennellia elongata</h1>
<p>Rennellia elongata, commonly known as the Rennellian spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rennell in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Rennellia elongata is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying island biodiversity.</p>
