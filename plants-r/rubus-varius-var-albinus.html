<p>Rubus varius var. albinus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white fruits, which contrast with the typical dark berries of other Rubus species. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and grows as a shrub with thorny stems. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique fruit color, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
