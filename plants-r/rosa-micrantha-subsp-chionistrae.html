<p>Rosa micrantha subsp.</p>
<p>chionistrae, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces oval, hairy leaves with a serrated margin, typical of many rose species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar climatic conditions.</p>
