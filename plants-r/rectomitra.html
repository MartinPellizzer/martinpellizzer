                    <h1>Rectomitra</h1>
<p>Rectomitra, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth at the base of the previous one. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often with a striking coloration that ranges from white to yellow.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Rectomitra lies in its morphological adaptations and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats.</p>
