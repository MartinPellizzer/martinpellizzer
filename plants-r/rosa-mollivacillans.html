<p>Rosa mollivacillans, commonly known as the velvet-soft rose, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silken foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming low shrubs with thornless stems. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range.</p>
