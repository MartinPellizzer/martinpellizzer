                            <h1>Ranunculus Acris Subvar. Glabrescens</h1>
<p>Common meadow buttercup, scientifically known as Ranunculus acris subvar. glabrescens, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family that thrives in open meadows and grasslands. This plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive central cup-like structure. It typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in sunny, well-drained soils. The subvariety glabrescens is notable for its smooth, hairless leaves and stems, distinguishing it from other Ranunculus species. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
