                    <h1>Rumex × confusus</h1>
<p>Rumex × confusus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel), resulting in a plant with intermediate characteristics. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and they have a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
