<p>Racosperma sericatum, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Racosperma sericatum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
