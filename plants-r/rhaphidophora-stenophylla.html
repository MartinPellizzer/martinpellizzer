                    <h1>Rhaphidophora stenophylla</h1>
<p>Rhaphidophora stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a climbing tropical fern native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, tree-like structure with a central stem and broad, leathery leaves that give it a staghorn appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes form a dense network that anchors it to trees or rocks, allowing it to grow in vertical habitats.</p>
<p>Rhaphidophora stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
