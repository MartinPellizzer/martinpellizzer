<p>Rhynchotechum eximium, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microspores and megaspores, typical of lycophytes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are essential for its propagation and ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
