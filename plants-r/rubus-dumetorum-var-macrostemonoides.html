                    <h1>Rubus dumetorum var. macrostemonoides</h1>
<p>Rubus dumetorum var. macrostemonoides, commonly known as the large-stamen blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its relatively large, showy flowers with prominent stamens, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of common blackberries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is noted for its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its identification and ecological role.</p>
