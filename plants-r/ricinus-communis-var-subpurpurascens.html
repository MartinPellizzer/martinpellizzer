                    <h1>Ricinus communis var. subpurpurascens</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis var. subpurpurascens, commonly known as the purple leaf castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking foliage.</p>
<p>The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and typically exhibit a vibrant purple or reddish hue, especially under full sun. This variety is cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for its oil-producing seeds. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its unique, spiky red flower heads that appear in late summer.</p>
