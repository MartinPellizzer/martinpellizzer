<p>Rhynchospora longibracteata var. minor, commonly known as the narrow bracted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often subtended by narrow bracts, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
