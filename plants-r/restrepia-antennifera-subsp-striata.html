<p>Restrepia antennifera subsp.</p>
<p>striata, commonly known as the striated lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive violet to purple coloration and a unique, slipper-shaped pouch.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
