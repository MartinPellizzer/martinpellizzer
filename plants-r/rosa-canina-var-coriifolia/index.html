                            <h1>Rosa Canina Var. Coriifolia</h1>
<p>Dog rose, scientifically known as Rosa canina var. coriifolia, is a captivating species of wild rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is distinguished by its delicate pink flowers and its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions. This plant is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along coastal areas, where it plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife. Its berries, which are edible for humans and animals, have been used for centuries in traditional medicine and culinary practices. Despite its modest appearance, the dog rose holds significant ecological and historical value.</p>
