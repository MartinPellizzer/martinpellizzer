<p>Rogersonanthus coccineus, commonly known as the scarlet flame or red-flowered orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and sepals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a contrasting yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
