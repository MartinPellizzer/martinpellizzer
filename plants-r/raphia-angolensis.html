                    <h1>Raphia angolensis</h1>
<p>Raphia angolensis, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a large, robust palm native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the leaves, followed by the development of elongated, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are often used for thatching and roofing, while the trunk is valued for its durable, fibrous material.</p>
<p>Raphia angolensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
