                    <h1>Rubus ulmifolius var. floccosus</h1>
<p>Rubus ulmifolius var. floccosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (woolly) covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries.</p>
