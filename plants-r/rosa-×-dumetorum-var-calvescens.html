                    <h1>Rosa × dumetorum var. calvescens</h1>
<p>Rosa × dumetorum var. calvescens, commonly known as the creeping red raspberry, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems that often lie close to the ground, forming mats. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, hairy berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, typical of many rose species.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in hedges or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
