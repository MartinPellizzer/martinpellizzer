                    <h1>Rhamnus polymorpha</h1>
<p>Rhamnus polymorpha, commonly known as the many-stemmed buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and as a decorative plant.</p>
