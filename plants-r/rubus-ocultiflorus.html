                    <h1>Rubus ocultiflorus</h1>
<p>Rubus ocultiflorus, commonly known as the hidden-flower raspberry, is a species of brambles belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, hairy berries in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive flowering pattern, it is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry species.</p>
