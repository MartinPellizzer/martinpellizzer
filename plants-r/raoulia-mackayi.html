<p>Raoulia mackayi, commonly known as the Mackay's raoulia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Raoulia mackayi thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it forms dense clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
