<p>Ricinocarpos verrucosus, commonly known as the rough-hair lichen, is a member of the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. The thallus is covered with small, rounded tubercles, giving it a distinctive, rough texture. It contains various secondary metabolites, including usnic acid and atranorin, which contribute to its chemical defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
