                    <h1>Racosperma ammophilum</h1>
<p>Racosperma ammophilum, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow floral spikes and feathery foliage, which help it thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, hard pods that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Racosperma ammophilum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
