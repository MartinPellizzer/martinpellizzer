<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>oculatidens, commonly known as the yellow pond-lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive, eye-like pattern on the petals, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its finely divided leaves and its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water environments.</p>
