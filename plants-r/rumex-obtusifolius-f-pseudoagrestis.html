<p>Rumex obtusifolius f. pseudoagrestis, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a variant of the broad-leaved dock characterized by its wider, more rounded leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family, typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are often surrounded by distinctive bracts. Its leaves are usually smooth or slightly hairy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
