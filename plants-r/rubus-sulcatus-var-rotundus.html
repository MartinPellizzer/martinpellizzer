<p>Rubus sulcatus var. rotundus, commonly known as the round-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, slightly smaller fruits compared to the typical blackberry, with a deep purple to black color when ripe. The plant produces thorny stems and has compound leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its berries are edible, though they are generally less sweet and more tart than those of other blackberry varieties.</p>
