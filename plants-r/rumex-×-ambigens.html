                    <h1>Rumex × ambigens</h1>
<p>Rumex × ambigens, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (southern sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on erect, branched inflorescences. Rumex × ambigens is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodland edges and meadows, and it is known for its edible leaves, though they are tart and acidic.</p>
<p>Its hybrid nature makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
