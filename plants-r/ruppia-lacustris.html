                    <h1>Ruppia lacustris</h1>
<p>Ruppia lacustris, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in brackish and freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to float on the water's surface. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are pollinated by wind, and it relies on water currents for seed dispersal. Ruppia lacustris is often found in shallow, still or slow-moving waters such as lakes, marshes, and estuaries.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and stable ecological conditions.</p>
