<p>Rebutia steinmannii var. cincinnata, commonly known as the Cincinnata Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with dense, spiny areoles that produce clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils it inhabits. Its small size and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
<p>It requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
