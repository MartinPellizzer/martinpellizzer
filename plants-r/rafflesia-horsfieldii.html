                    <h1>Rafflesia horsfieldii</h1>
<p>Rafflesia horsfieldii, commonly known as the giant padlock flower, is a parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh to attract pollinators like flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Despite its impressive size, the plant produces no petals, relying instead on a complex structure of fleshy, reddish petals and a central column.</p>
