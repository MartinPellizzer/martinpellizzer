<p>Rhipsalis incachacana, commonly known as the Andean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its soft, leafy stems that often hang in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that perform photosynthesis. It relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while still carrying out some photosynthesis itself.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis incachacana is often found in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests.</p>
