                    <h1>Rubus rivularis var. speluncarum</h1>
<p>Rubus rivularis var. speluncarum, commonly known as the cave raspberry, is a rare variant of the brambles found in subterranean environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in dark, humid conditions typical of caves and rock crevices, where it relies on limited light for photosynthesis. The plant has adapted to low-light conditions with elongated, slender leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruits are typically smaller and more acidic than those of its surface-dwelling relatives.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an endangered species with limited distribution.</p>
