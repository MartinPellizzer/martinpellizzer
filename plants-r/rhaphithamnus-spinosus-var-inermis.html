                    <h1>Rhaphithamnus spinosus var. inermis</h1>
<p>Rhaphithamnus spinosus var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth-fruited rhaphithamnus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, spineless stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It is adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and tolerate high temperatures.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical R. spinosus by the absence of spines and its smoother foliage.</p>
