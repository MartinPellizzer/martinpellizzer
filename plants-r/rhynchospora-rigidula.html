                    <h1>Rhynchospora rigidula</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora rigidula, commonly known as rigid flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Rhynchospora rigidula is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it a common indicator of wetland environments.</p>
