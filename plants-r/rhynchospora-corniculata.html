                    <h1>Rhynchospora corniculata</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora corniculata, commonly known as the horned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Rhynchospora corniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
