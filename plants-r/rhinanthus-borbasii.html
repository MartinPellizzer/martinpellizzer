                    <h1>Rhinanthus borbasii</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus borbasii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in grassland habitats, often in association with native grasses and wildflowers.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus borbasii plays an important ecological role in promoting biodiversity by stimulating the growth of host plants through its parasitic relationship.</p>
