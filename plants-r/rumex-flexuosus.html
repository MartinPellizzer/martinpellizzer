                    <h1>Rumex flexuosus</h1>
<p>Rumex flexuosus, commonly known as flexible sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
