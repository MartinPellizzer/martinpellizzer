<p>Ranunculus gelidus subsp.</p>
<p>grayi, commonly known as the Gray's glacier buttercup, is a rare alpine plant found in high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are typically deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
