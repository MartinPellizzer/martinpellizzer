<p>Rubus hirtus subsp.</p>
<p>declivis, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and prickly stems, which help it anchor to surfaces.</p>

<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more prostrate growth form compared to other Rubus species.</p>
