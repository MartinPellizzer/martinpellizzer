                    <h1>Rostkovia tristanensis</h1>
<p>Rostkovia tristanensis, commonly known as Tristan's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the remote Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a yellowish-green center. The plant typically grows in rocky coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh, wind-swept environment of its native habitat. It has a short lifespan, often blooming only once before dying, which makes it a rare and ephemeral species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, Rostkovia tristanensis is considered critically endangered.</p>
