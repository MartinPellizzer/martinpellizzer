                    <h1>Ranunculus cortusifolius var. villosus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus cortusifolius var. villosus, commonly known as the woolly water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully develop.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its delicate, floating or submerged growth habit and its preference for nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving waters.</p>
