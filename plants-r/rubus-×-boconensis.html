                    <h1>Rubus × boconensis</h1>
<p>Rubus × boconensis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (red raspberry).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark purple to black fruits that are typically larger than those of pure species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can show genetic variability in fruit size, color, and flavor.</p>
