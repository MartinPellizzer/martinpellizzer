                <h1>Ritterocactus mammulosus</h1>
<p>Ritterocactus mammulosus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which helps to reduce water loss and protect it from intense sunlight. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with few branches, and its spines are short and often hidden beneath the dense covering. It produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors.</p>
