                    <h1>Rhododendron viscigemmatum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron viscigemmatum, commonly known as the viscous-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that has a waxy, viscous texture, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems and thick, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>Rhododendron viscigemmatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
