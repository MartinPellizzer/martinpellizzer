<p>Ribes glaciale f. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy white currant, is a frost-tolerant shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black when mature. Its hairy foliage and stems are adaptations to cold climates, helping to retain heat and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in harsh environments.</p>
