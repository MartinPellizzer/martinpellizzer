                    <h1>Rhododendron farrerae var. leucotrichum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron farrerae var. leucotrichum, commonly known as the white-haired rhododendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. Its unique varietal trait of white trichomes on the leaves gives it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
