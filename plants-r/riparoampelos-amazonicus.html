<p>Riparoampelos amazonicus, commonly known as the Amazonian rock climber, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>

The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in the humid environment.</p>
