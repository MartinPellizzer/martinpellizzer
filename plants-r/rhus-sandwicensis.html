                    <h1>Rhus sandwicensis</h1>
<p>Rhus sandwicensis, commonly known as ʻahaʻula, is a native Hawaiian shrub or small tree belonging to the Anacardiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with oval or lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds and insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Rhus sandwicensis is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
