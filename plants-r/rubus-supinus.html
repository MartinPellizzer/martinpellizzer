                    <h1>Rubus supinus</h1>
<p>Rubus supinus, commonly known as the everlasting raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces red, hairy berries that are edible but often tart and less commonly consumed compared to other Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs.</p>
<p>Rubus supinus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
