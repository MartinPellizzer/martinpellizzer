                    <h1>Rubus argenteus var. longicuspidatus</h1>
<p>Rubus argenteus var. longicuspidatus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically less palatable than those of other blackberry species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Its thorny stems and showy flowers make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
