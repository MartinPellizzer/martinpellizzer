                            <h1>Ranunculus Lappaceus Var. Nanus</h1>
<p>Lesser lapp's buttercup, scientifically known as Ranunculus lappaceus var. nanus, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky and moist environments, often found in mountainous areas where the climate is cool and the soil is well-drained. Its delicate yellow flowers, with a distinctive white center, bloom in early spring, adding a touch of vibrancy to the otherwise barren landscape. Despite its modest size, this plant plays an important role in its ecosystem, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
