<p>Rafnia alpina, commonly known as the alpine rafnia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rafnia alpina is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems.</p>
