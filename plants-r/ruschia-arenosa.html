<p>Ruschia arenosa, commonly known as the sandruschia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Ruschia arenosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
