                    <h1>Rebutia rubiginosa</h1>
<p>Rebutia rubiginosa, commonly known as the rust-colored euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle touch of color to its otherwise muted foliage. Its leaves are typically small and may be present during the growing season but often shed during dormancy.</p>
<p>Rebutia rubiginosa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
