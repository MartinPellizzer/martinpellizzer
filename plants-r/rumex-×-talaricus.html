                    <h1>Rumex × talaricus</h1>
<p>Rumex × talaricus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and greenish, arranged in loose clusters, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its culinary and medicinal uses.</p>
