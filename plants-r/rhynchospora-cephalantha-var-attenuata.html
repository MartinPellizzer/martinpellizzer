                    <h1>Rhynchospora cephalantha var. attenuata</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora cephalantha var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender swamp cord-grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it forms dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purple in color, especially at the base. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in groups, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its attenuated (gradually tapering) leaf blades, which set it apart from other varieties within the species.</p>
