                    <h1>Ranunculus pantothrix var. rigidus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus pantothrix var. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow with brown or black markings, and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'rigidus' is distinguished by its stiff, upright stems and leaves compared to other varieties of the species.</p>
