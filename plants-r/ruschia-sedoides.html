<p>Ruschia sedoides, commonly known as the silver leaf Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
