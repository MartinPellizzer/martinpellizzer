<p>Rosa dumalis subsp.</p>
<p>glaucifolia, commonly known as the glaucous rose, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically gray-green in color due to a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation.</p>
