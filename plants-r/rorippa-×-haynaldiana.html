                    <h1>Rorippa × haynaldiana</h1>
<p>Rorippa × haynaldiana, commonly known as the Himalayan watercress, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rorippa islandica and Rorippa sylvestris.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its alternate, broadly lanceolate leaves and small, white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant thrives in moist, often aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
