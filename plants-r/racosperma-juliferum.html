                    <h1>Racosperma juliferum</h1>
<p>Racosperma juliferum, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and a capacity to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>Racosperma juliferum is often used in rehabilitation of degraded soils due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits.</p>
