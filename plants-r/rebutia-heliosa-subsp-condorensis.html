<p>Rebutia heliosa subsp.</p>
<p>condorensis, commonly known as the Condor Desert Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the high Andes of southern Peru. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, ribbed structure and is covered in white to pale green spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is adapted to arid and cold environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
