<p>Rosa fedtschenkoana var. ovata, commonly known as the Pamir rose, is a rare and cold-hardy shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are adapted to harsh mountain environments. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate beauty to its rugged habitat. It is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
