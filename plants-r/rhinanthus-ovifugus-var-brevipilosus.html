                    <h1>Rhinanthus ovifugus var. brevipilosus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus ovifugus var. brevipilosus, commonly known as the short-hairy yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, and its small, hairy seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more densely hairy stems compared to other varieties of yellow rattle.</p>
