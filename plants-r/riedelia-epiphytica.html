                    <h1>Riedelia epiphytica</h1>
<p>Riedelia epiphytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding environment. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found growing on trees or rock surfaces in humid, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation efforts.</p>
