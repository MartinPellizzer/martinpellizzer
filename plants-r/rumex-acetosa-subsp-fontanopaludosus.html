<p>Rumex acetosa subsp.</p>
<p>fontanopaludosus, commonly known as the water sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sometimes reddish stems and trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on leafless stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in wet soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other damp environments, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged conditions.</p>
