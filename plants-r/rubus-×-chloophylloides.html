                    <h1>Rubus × chloophylloides</h1>
<p>Rubus × chloophylloides, commonly known as the chlorophyllous raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the crossbreeding of Rubus species.</p>
<p>It exhibits enhanced chlorophyll content, leading to deeper green foliage compared to its parent plants. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, producing berries that are smaller than typical raspberries.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its improved photosynthetic efficiency and potential agricultural applications.</p>
