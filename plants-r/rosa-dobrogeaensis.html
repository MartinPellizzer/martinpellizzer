                    <h1>Rosa dobrogeaensis</h1>
<p>Rosa dobrogeaensis, commonly known as the Dobrogea rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Dobrogea region of Romania.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant with woody stems and dense foliage, typically growing in dry, calcareous soils. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its fruits are hairy achenes enclosed in a persistent receptacle.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa dobrogeaensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
