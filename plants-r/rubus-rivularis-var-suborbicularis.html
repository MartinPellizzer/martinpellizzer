                    <h1>Rubus rivularis var. suborbicularis</h1>
<p>Rubus rivularis var. suborbicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but generally less flavorful than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found along stream banks and in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species.</p>
