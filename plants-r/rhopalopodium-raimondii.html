                    <h1>Rhopalopodium raimondii</h1>
<p>Rhopalopodium raimondii, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, spiny bracts that resemble small stars, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Rhopalopodium raimondii is well adapted to extreme heat and low precipitation, making it a resilient addition to xerophytic gardens.</p>
