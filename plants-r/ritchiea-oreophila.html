                    <h1>Ritchiea oreophila</h1>
<p>Ritchiea oreophila, commonly known as the mountain ritchiea, is a rare cycad species native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ritchiea oreophila thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
