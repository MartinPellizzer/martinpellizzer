<p>Rubus koehleri var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western everlet, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are often used in local foraging practices.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Rubus species but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits.</p>
