                    <h1>Rhizophora latifolia</h1>
<p>Rhizophora latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its extensive root system, which includes prop roots that provide structural support and aid in oxygen absorption from water. The plant thrives in saline environments, making it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), helping to reduce water loss in brackish conditions.</p>
<p>Rhizophora latifolia plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastlines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life.</p>
