                    <h1>Ranunculus auricomus subsp. valdesii</h1>
<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>valdesii, commonly known as the Valdes' buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodlands, and streambanks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of R. auricomus.</p>
