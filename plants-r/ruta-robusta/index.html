                            <h1>Ruta Robusta</h1>
<p>Ruta robusta is a hardy shrub native to the Mediterranean region known for its strong, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance ornamental plants. Its name comes from the Latin word "ruta," which refers to a type of herb used in ancient times. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in use. Despite its potential hazards, Ruta robusta remains a striking addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes.</p>
