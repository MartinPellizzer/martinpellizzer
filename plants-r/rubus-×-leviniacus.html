                    <h1>Rubus × leviniacus</h1>
<p>Rubus × leviniacus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a polyploid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark purple to black fruits that are typically larger and more robust than those of pure blackberries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for its unique flavor and culinary versatility.</p>
