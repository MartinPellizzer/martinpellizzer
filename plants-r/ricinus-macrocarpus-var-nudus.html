                    <h1>Ricinus macrocarpus var. nudus</h1>
<p>Ricinus macrocarpus var. nudus, commonly known as the naked castor oil plant, is a tropical species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often hairless, giving it the "nudus" designation. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic, oil-rich seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, due to the toxicity of its seeds, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for indoor cultivation without proper precautions.</p>
