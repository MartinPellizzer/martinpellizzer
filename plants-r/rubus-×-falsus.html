<p>Rubus × falsus, commonly known as the false blackberry, is a hybrid plant within the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that resemble blackberries. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small white or pink flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it is occasionally found in wild areas and can be challenging to distinguish from other Rubus species.</p>
