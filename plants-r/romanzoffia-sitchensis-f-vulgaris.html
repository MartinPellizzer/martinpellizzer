<p>Romanzoffia sitchensis f. vulgaris, commonly known as the Sitka sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and tidal zones, where it thrives in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels makes it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
