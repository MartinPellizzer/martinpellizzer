                    <h1>Ranunculus aquatilis var. caespitosus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus aquatilis var. caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and marshes, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in groups of three to five.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediment and improve water quality.</p>
