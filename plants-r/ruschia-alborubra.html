                    <h1>Ruschia alborubra</h1>
<p>Ruschia alborubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically red or purple in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ruschia alborubra thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
