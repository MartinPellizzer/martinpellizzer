<p>Racinaea adpressa subsp.</p>
<p>adpressa, commonly known as the flat racinaea, is a rare and unique fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tightly compressed, strap-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the forest floor.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures are concealed beneath the foliage, making it challenging to identify without careful examination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
