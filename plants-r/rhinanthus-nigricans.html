<p>Rhinanthus nigricans, commonly known as the black knapweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a slender, branching stem covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus nigricans plays a role in supporting pollinators, particularly bumblebees, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
