                    <h1>Rosa × malmundariensis</h1>
<p>Rosa × malmundariensis, commonly known as the Malm's rose, is a hybrid rose species that originated from crosses between Rosa gallica and Rosa damascena.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive, slightly twisted appearance. The plant is deciduous, featuring thorny stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its historical use in perfumery and as a parent in many modern rose varieties.</p>
