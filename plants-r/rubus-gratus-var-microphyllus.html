<p>Rubus gratus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved evergreen blackberry, is a variant of the evergreen blackberry species native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus gratus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and edible fruits.</p>
