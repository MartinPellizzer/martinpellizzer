                    <h1>Rebis frigida</h1>
<p>Rebis frigida, commonly known as the frostbitten fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green fronds that resemble those of a fern. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps protect it from extreme cold and desiccation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rebis frigida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
