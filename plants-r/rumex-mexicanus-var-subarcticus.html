                    <h1>Rumex mexicanus var. subarcticus</h1>
<p>Rumex mexicanus var. subarcticus, commonly known as the Arctic dock, is a perennial herb native to arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its robust growth form allows it to persist in harsh climatic conditions where few other plants can survive.</p>
