                    <h1>Rotang asperrimus</h1>
<p>Rotang asperrimus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed rattan, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its woody stem and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clustered, spiny fruits. Its robust and flexible stems make it valuable for furniture and handicrafts.</p>
<p>However, overharvesting has led to its decline in some regions, prompting conservation efforts.</p>
