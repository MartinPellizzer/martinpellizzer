                    <h1>Rapistrum costatum</h1>
<p>Rapistrum costatum, commonly known as the sea rocket or rocket grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Rapistrum costatum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
