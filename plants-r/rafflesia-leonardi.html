                    <h1>Rafflesia leonardi</h1>
<p>Rafflesia leonardi, commonly known as the Leonard's Rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong odor resembling decaying meat to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Rafflesia leonardi is critically endangered and remains one of the rarest and least understood plants in the world.</p>
