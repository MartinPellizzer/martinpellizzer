                    <h1>Rhinanthus coccineus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus coccineus, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bright orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and short flowering period make it a notable yet ephemeral wildflower.</p>
