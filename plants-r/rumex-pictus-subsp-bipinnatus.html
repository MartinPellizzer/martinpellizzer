<p>Rumex pictus subsp.</p>
<p>bipinnatus, commonly known as the red sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are pinnately divided into small, serrated lobes.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by oval, reddish-brown seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its leaves are edible, though they have a sharp, tangy flavor due to their high oxalic acid content.</p>
