                    <h1>Rosa canina f. biserratoides</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. biserratoides, commonly known as the double-serrated dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive double-serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from the typical single-serrated leaves of the parent species. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its hips, like those of Rosa canina, are edible and rich in vitamin C. This cultivar is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature.</p>
