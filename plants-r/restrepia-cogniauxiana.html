<p>Restrepia cogniauxiana, commonly known as the Cogniaux's restia, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high Andes of Peru.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a delicate, creeping rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with intricate, spurred petals, typical of the Epidendroideae subfamily. It thrives in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
