<p>Rorippa laurentii subsp.</p>
<p>tsaratananae, commonly known as the Tsaratanana watercress, is a rare aquatic plant native to Madagascar. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in streams and pools with cool, clear water.</p>
<p>The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged, and it produces tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct genetic makeup compared to other Rorippa species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
