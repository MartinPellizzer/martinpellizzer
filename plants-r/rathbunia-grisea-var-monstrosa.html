                    <h1>Rathbunia grisea var. monstrosa</h1>
<p>Rathbunia grisea var. monstrosa, commonly known as the giant purple lichen, is a unique variant of the species characterized by its striking, elongated thallus structure.</p>
<p>It exhibits a deep purple to greyish-blue coloration, which is more intense than the typical form of Rathbunia grisea. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths on rock surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It is a symbiotic lichen, comprising a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
