                    <h1>Romulea rosea var. muirii</h1>
<p>Romulea rosea var. muirii, commonly known as the Muir's glory of the snow, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, star-shaped appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, often appearing only after rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
