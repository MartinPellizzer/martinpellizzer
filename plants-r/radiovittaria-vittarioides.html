<p>Radiovittaria vittarioides, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden dust, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Radiovittaria vittarioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
