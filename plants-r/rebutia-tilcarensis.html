                    <h1>Rebutia tilcarensis</h1>
<p>Rebutia tilcarensis, commonly known as the Tilcarensis Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, cylindrical stems. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by small, round fruits. Rebutia tilcarensis is well adapted to dry environments, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts seeking low-maintenance, decorative plants.</p>
