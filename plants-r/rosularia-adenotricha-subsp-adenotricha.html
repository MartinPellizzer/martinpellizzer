<p>Rosularia adenotricha subsp.</p>
<p>adenotricha, commonly known as the woolly rosebay, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dense covering of white, woolly hairs on its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid or semi-arid gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
