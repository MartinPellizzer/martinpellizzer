                    <h1>Roegneria × mayebarana</h1>
<p>Roegneria × mayebarana, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile, diploid grass species resulting from the cross between Roegneria koeleri and Roegneria macrantha.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves, often forming dense, tufted clumps. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers, typically in shades of green or purple. It is primarily cultivated as an ornamental grass for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, making propagation through division or rhizomes essential.</p>
