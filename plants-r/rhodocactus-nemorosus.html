<p>Rhodocactus nemorosus, commonly known as the forest cactus, is a unique species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Rhodocactus nemorosus is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
