                    <h1>Rubus mucidus</h1>
<p>Rubus mucidus, commonly known as the stinking blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark berries that are often described as having a strong, unpleasant odor. These berries are typically harvested when fully ripe, though their flavor is generally considered bitter and astringent.</p>
<p>Due to its sharp scent and taste, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other blackberry varieties.</p>
