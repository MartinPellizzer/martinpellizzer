                    <h1>Rabdosiella ternifolia</h1>
<p>Rabdosiella ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary photosynthetic function. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
