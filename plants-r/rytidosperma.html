                    <h1>Rytidosperma</h1>
<p>Rytidosperma, commonly known as the needle grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Rytidosperma species typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. They are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used for erosion control due to their hardy and resilient nature.</p>
