                    <h1>Roegneria serpentina</h1>
<p>Roegneria serpentina, commonly known as the snakegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Roegneria serpentina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
