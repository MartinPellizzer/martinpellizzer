                    <h1>Ranunculus alismifolius var. alismellus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus alismifolius var. alismellus, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive, waxy appearance. The plant has heart-shaped, smooth leaves that are often floating or submerged in water, adapted to its aquatic environment. Its flowers emit a mild, sweet scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more strongly aromatic foliage compared to the typical form of Ranunculus alismifolius.</p>
