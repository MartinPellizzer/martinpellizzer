                    <h1>Rhododendron brassii</h1>
<p>Rhododendron brassii, commonly known as the purple-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. The plant is characterized by its striking, dark purple foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Rhododendron brassii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
