                    <h1>Rivina humilis</h1>
<p>Rivina humilis, commonly known as the redroot or scarlet ivy, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds due to their color and nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Rivina humilis is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun.</p>
