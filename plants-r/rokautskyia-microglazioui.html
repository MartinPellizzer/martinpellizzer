<p>Rokautskyia microglazioui, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in the harsh conditions of the continent's dry valleys. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the brief summer season. Its leaves are short and densely packed, helping to retain moisture in the arid climate.</p>
<p>Rokautskyia microglazioui plays a vital role in the fragile ecosystems of Antarctica, serving as a food source for local invertebrates.</p>
