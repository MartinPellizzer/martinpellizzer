<p>Rumex acetosella var. communis, commonly known as sour grass, is a small perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and reddish stems that often bear small, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that are borne on erect spikes, and it is often found in moist, acidic soils such as those in bogs or heathlands. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, it is often used as an indicator species for acidic soils.</p>
