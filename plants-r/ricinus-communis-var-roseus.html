                    <h1>Ricinus communis var. roseus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis var. roseus, commonly known as the roseleaf castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive pink to red bracts that surround the spiny seed pods.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture. It produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, making it potentially hazardous if ingested.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties.</p>
