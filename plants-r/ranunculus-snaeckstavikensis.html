<p>Ranunculus snaeckstavikensis, commonly known as the Snaeckstavik buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, typically yellow or white flowers with numerous petals. The plant has a short growing season, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
