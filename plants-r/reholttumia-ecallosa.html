                    <h1>Reholttumia ecallosa</h1>
<p>Reholttumia ecallosa, commonly known as the silverleaf cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem covered in dense, silver-gray hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide additional protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
