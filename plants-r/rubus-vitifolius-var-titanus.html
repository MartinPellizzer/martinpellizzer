                    <h1>Rubus vitifolius var. titanus</h1>
<p>Rubus vitifolius var. titanus, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, robust leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color, though they are often smaller and less flavorful than common blackberries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
