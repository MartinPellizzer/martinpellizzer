<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cooler temperatures. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Retiniphyllum kuhlmannii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
