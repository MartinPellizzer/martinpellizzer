<p>Rosa orphanidis, commonly known as the Orphan's Rose, is a rare and elusive species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate pink to white petals and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rosa orphanidis is often found in rocky or forested habitats, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
