                    <h1>Rafflesia arnoldi var. arnoldi</h1>
<p>Rafflesia arnoldi var. arnoldi, commonly known as the giant Rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant known for its enormous, fleshy, and odorless花朵.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, typically a vine of the genus Tetrastigma, for nutrients. The plant's most striking feature is its massive, red-colored flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. It blooms only once in its lifetime, producing a strong, carrion-like smell to attract pollinators like flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered critically endangered in its native rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
