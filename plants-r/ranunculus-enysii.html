                    <h1>Ranunculus enysii</h1>
<p>Ranunculus enysii, commonly known as Enys' buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers with deeply lobed petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ranunculus enysii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
