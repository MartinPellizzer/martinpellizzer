<p>Rhaphis gryllus, commonly known as the grassy fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble grass in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or near water sources. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Rhaphis gryllus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
