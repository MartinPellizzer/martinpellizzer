                    <h1>Rubus ferrariarum</h1>
<p>Rubus ferrariarum, commonly known as the Ferrari raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red, edible fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has a generally shrub-like growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus genus.</p>
