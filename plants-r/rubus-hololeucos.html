<p>Rubus hololeucos, commonly known as the white-leafed raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its pale green to white leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range.</p>
