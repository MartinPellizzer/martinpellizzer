                    <h1>Ricinus communis subvar. pruinosus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis subvar. pruinosus, commonly known as the velvetleaf castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive velvety, glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>This subvariety is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of these fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in the production of castor oil.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
