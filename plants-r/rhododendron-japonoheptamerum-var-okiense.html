                    <h1>Rhododendron japonoheptamerum var. okiense</h1>
<p>Rhododendron japonoheptamerum var. okiense, commonly known as the Okinawan rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, typical of its natural habitat in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
