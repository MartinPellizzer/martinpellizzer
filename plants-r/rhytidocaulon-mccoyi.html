<p>Rhytidocaulon mccoyi, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in desert plants to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rhytidocaulon mccoyi is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
