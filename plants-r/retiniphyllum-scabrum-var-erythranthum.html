The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological needs, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
