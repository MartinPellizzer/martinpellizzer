                    <h1>Rostraria amblyantha</h1>
<p>Rostraria amblyantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rostraria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories. Its unique rostrum-like structure on the flower spike distinguishes it from other orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rostraria amblyantha is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
