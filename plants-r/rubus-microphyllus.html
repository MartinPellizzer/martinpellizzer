                <h1>Rubus microphyllus</h1>
<p>Rubus microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically black when ripe, though they are often less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and hardiness, it is a popular choice for cultivation in smaller gardens.</p>
