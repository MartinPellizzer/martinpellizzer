                    <h1>Rafflesia banahawensis</h1>
<p>Rafflesia banahawensis, commonly known as the Banahaw Rafflesia, is a rare and striking parasitic flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its enormous, reddish-orange花朵 with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies for pollination. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. It produces a single, large flower that can measure up to 30 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of the Philippines.</p>
