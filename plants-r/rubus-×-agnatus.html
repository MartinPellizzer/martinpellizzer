                    <h1>Rubus × agnatus</h1>
<p>Rubus × agnatus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart and slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a unique and versatile plant in horticulture.</p>
