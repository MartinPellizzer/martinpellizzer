                    <h1>Rosa canina f. graciliramea</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. graciliramea, commonly known as the slender-stemmed dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose, characterized by its slender, often sparsely hairy stems.</p>
<p>It typically features pale pink to white flowers with five petals, and its leaves are pinnately compound with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces red, fuzzy hips that are rich in vitamin C and are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows.</p>
<p>This form is less commonly cultivated than the standard Rosa canina but is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
