                    <h1>Rhododendron pagophilum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron pagophilum, commonly known as the Antarctic rhododendron, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the cold regions of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects that are active in the warmer months.</p>
<p>Rhododendron pagophilum is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh polar environments.</p>
