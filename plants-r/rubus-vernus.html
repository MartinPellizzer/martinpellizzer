                    <h1>Rubus vernus</h1>
<p>Rubus vernus, commonly known as the early blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. These berries are often used in jams and desserts due to their tart flavor.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other brambles such as Rubus fruticosus.</p>
