                    <h1>Rhinacanthus osmospermus</h1>
<p>Rhinacanthus osmospermus, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mangle*, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aerial roots, which provide structural support and aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, reddish flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release buoyant seeds for dispersal by water.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting marine ecosystems.</p>
