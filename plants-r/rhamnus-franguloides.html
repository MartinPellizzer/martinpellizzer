                    <h1>Rhamnus franguloides</h1>
<p>Rhamnus franguloides, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, black berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions of North America due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants.</p>
