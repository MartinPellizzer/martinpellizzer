<p>Rottboellia ophiuroides var. intermedia, commonly known as red grass or red oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive red-colored inflorescences that appear in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
