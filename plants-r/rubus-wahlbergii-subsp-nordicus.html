<p>Rubus wahlbergii subsp.</p>
<p>nordicus, commonly known as the Arctic bramble, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its small, prickly stems and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by red, edible berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
