                            <h1>Rubus Mulleri Subsp. Schorleri</h1>
<p>Muller's blackberry, scientifically known as Rubus mulleri subsp. schorleri, is a rare and striking member of the Rosaceae family native to the mountainous regions of South America. This subspecies is distinguished by its deep purple to black berries, which are both visually captivating and rich in antioxidants. Despite its beauty, it remains elusive, thriving only in specific microhabitats with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its limited distribution and unique ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Muller's blackberry faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
