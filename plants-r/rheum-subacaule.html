                    <h1>Rheum subacaule</h1>
<p>Rheum subacaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are edible but contain high levels of oxalic acid, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
