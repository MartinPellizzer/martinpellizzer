<p>Rottboellia xerochloa, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Rottboellia xerochloa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
