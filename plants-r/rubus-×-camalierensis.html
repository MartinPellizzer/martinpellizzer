                    <h1>Rubus × camalierensis</h1>
<p>Rubus × camalierensis, commonly known as the Camalier blackberry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm blackberry) and Rubus strigosus (prickly blackberry).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, often with a sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of genetic variability in morphology and fruit characteristics.</p>
