<p>Rosa tomentosa var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal rose, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt-laden air and coastal winds. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine white tomentum, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
