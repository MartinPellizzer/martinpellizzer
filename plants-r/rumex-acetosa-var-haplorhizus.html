<p>Rumex acetosa var. haplorhizus, commonly known as narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
