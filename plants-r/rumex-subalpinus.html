                    <h1>Rumex subalpinus</h1>
<p>Rumex subalpinus, commonly known as alpine sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Rumex subalpinus is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor.</p>
