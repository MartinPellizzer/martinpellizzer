                    <h1>Rhododendron glaucum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron glaucum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including the Himalayas and eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early to mid-spring. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
