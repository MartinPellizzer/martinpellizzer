<p>Retinispora filicoides, commonly known as the fern-like lichen, is a unique plant that exhibits characteristics of both ferns and lichens.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure.

Retinispora filicoides typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its appearance resembles a delicate fern, contributing to its common name.</p>
