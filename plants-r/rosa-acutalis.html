<p>Rosa acutalis, commonly known as the sharp-leaved rose, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers in early summer, which are followed by red-orange hips that persist into winter. Rosa acutalis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal interest throughout the year.</p>
