<p>Rhipsalis parasitica subsp.</p>
<p>erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries are red and fleshy, attracting birds that help disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
