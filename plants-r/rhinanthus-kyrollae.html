                    <h1>Rhinanthus kyrollae</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus kyrollae, commonly known as the Kyroll's redflower, is a rare and endangered species of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Native to the UK, it is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers, which are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, its conservation status remains critically vulnerable.</p>
