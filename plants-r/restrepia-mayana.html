<p>Restrepia mayana, commonly known as the Mayan orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
