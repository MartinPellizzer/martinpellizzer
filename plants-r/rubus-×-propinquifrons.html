                    <h1>Rubus × propinquifrons</h1>
<p>Rubus × propinquifrons, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a firm, tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for breeding programs aimed at improving fruit quality and disease resistance.</p>
