                            <h1>Retama Sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Spanish broom, scientifically known as Retama sphaerocarpa, is a hardy shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers and thorny stems, making it a striking addition to landscapes. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive growth habits. The plant thrives in poor soils and dry climates, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its ecological impact has led to increased efforts in managing its spread across various ecosystems.</p>
