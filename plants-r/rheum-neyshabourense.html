<p>Rheum neyshabourense, commonly known as the Neyshabour rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces tall, clustered flowering stalks that bear small, greenish-white flowers. Its rhubarb-like stems are edible but are typically not consumed due to their tart flavor and fibrous texture.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties.</p>
