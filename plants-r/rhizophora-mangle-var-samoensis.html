                    <h1>Rhizophora mangle var. samoensis</h1>
<p>Rhizophora mangle var. samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan mangrove, is a variant of the red mangrove that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aerial prop roots, which provide structural support and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous fruit that floats, enabling dispersal by water.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
