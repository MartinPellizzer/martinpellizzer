                    <h1>Rhododendron bellum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron bellum, commonly known as the Alpine rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms.</p>
<p>Rhododendron bellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat.</p>
