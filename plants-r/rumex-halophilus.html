                    <h1>Rumex halophilus</h1>
<p>Rumex halophilus, commonly known as saltbush or sea rumex, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Rumex halophilus is adapted to grow in soils with high salt content, making it a halophyte.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in saline conditions makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems and for phytoremediation efforts.</p>
