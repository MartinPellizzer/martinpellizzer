<p>Rhinanthus borealis subsp.</p>

<p>This subspecies typically grows in wet meadows and marshy habitats, where it forms dense stands. Its roots are hemiparasitic, meaning they partially depend on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
