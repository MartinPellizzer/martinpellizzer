                    <h1>Rafflesia bengkuluensis</h1>
<p>Rafflesia bengkuluensis, commonly known as the Bengkulu Rafflesia, is a rare and striking parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of Sumatra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its enormous, fleshy, and highly fragrant flowers, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong odor reminiscent of decaying meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rafflesia bengkuluensis is considered one of the most endangered species of its kind.</p>
