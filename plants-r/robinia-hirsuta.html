<p>Robinia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Robinia hirsuta is also known for its hard, heavy wood, which was historically used for tool handles and other durable items.</p>
