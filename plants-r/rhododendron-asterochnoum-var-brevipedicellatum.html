                    <h1>Rhododendron asterochnoum var. brevipedicellatum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron asterochnoum var. brevipedicellatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed alpine rhododendron, is a rare and hardy species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically dark green and leathery, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. This variety thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered plant in its native range.</p>
