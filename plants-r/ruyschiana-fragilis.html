<p>Ruyschiana fragilis, commonly known as the brittle ruyschiana, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant's leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall fragile appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is known for its short blooming period during the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ruyschiana fragilis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
