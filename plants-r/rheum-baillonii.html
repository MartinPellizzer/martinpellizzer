                    <h1>Rheum baillonii</h1>
<p>Rheum baillonii, commonly known as the Bailloni rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces erect, branched stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers in late summer. Its rhubarb-like leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, unlike edible rhubarb, Rheum baillonii is not typically consumed due to its potential toxicity.</p>
