<p>Rosa pendulina subvar. brachyclada, commonly known as the creeping shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features arching, thornless stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing bushes. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with ovate to elliptical leaflets that are serrated along the edges.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for erosion control and ground cover in moist, partially shaded environments.</p>
