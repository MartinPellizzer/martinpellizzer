<p>Rheum sanguineum, commonly known as the blood rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall, reddish stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. Its rhubarb-like stems are edible, though they are typically used in traditional medicine rather than culinary applications.</p>
<p>Rheum sanguineum is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and laxative effects.</p>
