The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roylea elegans is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
