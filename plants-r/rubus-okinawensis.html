<p>Rubus okinawensis, commonly known as the Okinawa raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color, though they are less commonly consumed than other raspberry species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
