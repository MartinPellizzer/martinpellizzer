                    <h1>Ranunculus tureholmiensis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus tureholmiensis, commonly known as the Tureholmi buttercup, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers with prominent, dark-centered sepals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its small, hairy leaves and short, upright stems are adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
