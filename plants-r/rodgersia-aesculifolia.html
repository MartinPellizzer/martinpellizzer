                    <h1>Rodgersia aesculifolia</h1>
<p>Rodgersia aesculifolia, commonly known as the elephant ears fern, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features large, palmately compound leaves that resemble elephant ears, typically with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and ability to add texture and interest to shaded landscapes.</p>
