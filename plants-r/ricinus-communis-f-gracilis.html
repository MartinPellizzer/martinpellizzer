                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. gracilis</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and reduced leaf size compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic, orange-red seeds that are highly ornamental but should be handled with care. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its unique appearance, though it is less commonly cultivated than the standard castor plant.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both botanical gardens and ecological studies.</p>
