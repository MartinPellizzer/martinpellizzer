                    <h1>Rubus rosaceus var. infecundus</h1>
<p>Rubus rosaceus var. infecundus, commonly known as the barren blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. Unlike most blackberries, this variety produces very few or no fruits, hence its common name. The plant thrives in woodland and shrubland habitats, often in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its unique reproductive behavior and its role in ecological studies of plant adaptation.</p>
