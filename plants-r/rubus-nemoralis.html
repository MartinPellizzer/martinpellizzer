                    <h1>Rubus nemoralis</h1>
<p>Rubus nemoralis, commonly known as bramble or blackberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are usually black when ripe and contain a sweet, juicy pulp. Rubus nemoralis thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and insects, and its roots help prevent soil erosion.</p>
