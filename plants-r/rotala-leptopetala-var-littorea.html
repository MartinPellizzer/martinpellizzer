<p>Rotala leptopetala var. littorea, commonly known as the coastal rotala, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along water surfaces or moist soil. The plant features small, oval leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement, and it produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in spikes. It thrives in shallow, brackish or freshwater environments and is often found in mangrove or estuarine areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in aquatic horticulture for ornamental purposes.</p>
