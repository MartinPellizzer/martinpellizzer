<p>Rhipsalis paradoxa var. catenulata, commonly known as the chain-ivy cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender, and often cascading stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The stems are covered in small, white, woolly hairs and bear small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in winter. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
