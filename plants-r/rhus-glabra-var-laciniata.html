<p>Rhus glabra var. laciniata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with serrated margins, which give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a characteristic feature. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a smooth texture, contrasting with the more rugged leaves of the typical Rhus glabra.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
