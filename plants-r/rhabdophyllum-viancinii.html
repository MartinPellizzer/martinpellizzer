<p>Rhabdophyllum viancinii, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with distinctive red veins, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas.</p>
