<p>Rubus robustus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) covering on its stems and leaves, which provides insulation and protection against environmental stress. The plant produces large, dark purple berries that are typically clustered at the ends of its thorny stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have serrated margins.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits.</p>
