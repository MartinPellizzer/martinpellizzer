<p>Ruta graveolens var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, pinnately compound leaves with a strong, pungent odor due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
