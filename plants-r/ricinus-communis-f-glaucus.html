                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. glaucus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous castor oil plant, is a variant of the common castor plant characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage.</p>
<p>This cultivar features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, powdery wax, giving them a unique appearance. The plant produces striking, spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>The glaucous coating on its leaves also helps reduce water loss, making it relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
