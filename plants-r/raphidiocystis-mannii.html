                    <h1>Raphidiocystis mannii</h1>
<p>Raphidiocystis mannii, commonly known as the green alga, is a unicellular, aquatic organism belonging to the class Chlorophyceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical shape and the presence of a single, large chloroplast containing pyrenoids for carbon fixation. This species is typically found in freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. Raphidiocystis mannii reproduces asexually through cell division, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems as a primary producer.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and rapid growth make it an important subject in studies of algal physiology and ecology.</p>
