                    <h1>Rudbeckia grandiflora var. alismifolia</h1>
<p>Rudbeckia grandiflora var. alismifolia, commonly known as the waterleaf rudbeckia, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the water plantain, hence its common name. The plant produces large, showy yellow daisy-like flowers with dark centers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
