                    <h1>Rubacer columbianum</h1>
<p>Rubacer columbianum, commonly known as the Colombian redwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is a towering evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 40 meters, characterized by its thick, reddish-brown bark and dark, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits containing a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to deforestation and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
