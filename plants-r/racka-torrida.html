<p>Racka torrida, commonly known as the fiery flame orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange petals that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental needs, Racka torrida is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
