                    <h1>Rubus × cryptadenoides</h1>
<p>Rubus × cryptadenoides, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits.</p>
