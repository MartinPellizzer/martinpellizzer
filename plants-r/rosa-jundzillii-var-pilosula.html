<p>Rosa jundzillii var. pilosula, commonly known as the silky rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>

It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
