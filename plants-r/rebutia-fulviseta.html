<p>Rebutia fulviseta, commonly known as the orange-tipped gloxinia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in dense, woolly white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a red or orange throat. Its leaves are typically small, rounded, and covered in a similar fuzzy coating.</p>
<p>Rebutia fulviseta is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation, requiring well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
