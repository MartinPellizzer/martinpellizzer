                    <h1>Rafflesia panchoana</h1>
<p>Rafflesia panchoana, commonly known as the Panchoana stinking corpse flower, is a parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is renowned for producing the largest individual flower of any known species, with blooms reaching up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia panchoana is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native ecosystem.</p>
