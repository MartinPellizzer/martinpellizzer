                    <h1>Ricinus communis var. undulatus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis var. undulatus, commonly known as the wavy-cotyledon or undulate castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its uniquely wavy or undulating cotyledons.</p>
<p>This plant is native to tropical regions and is known for its ornamental value due to its striking, palmate leaves. The leaves are typically large, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals.</p>
