<p>Rhododendron calostrotum subsp.</p>
<p>keleticum, commonly known as the Keletic rhododendron, is a rare and specialized evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and requires high levels of sunlight, though it is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on alpine plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
