                    <h1>Rubus pseudotriflorus</h1>
<p>Rubus pseudotriflorus, commonly known as the false tripleflower raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are generally smaller and less flavorful than those of other raspberry species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats.</p>
