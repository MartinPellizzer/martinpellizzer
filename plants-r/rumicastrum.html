<p>Rumicastrum, commonly known as the bladder campion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, which aid in seed dispersal. They typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and prominent stamens.</p>
<p>Rumicastrum species are generally small herbs, some of which are used in traditional medicine.</p>
