                    <h1>Rhadamanthus involutus</h1>
<p>Rhadamanthus involutus, commonly known as the curled rhadamanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence that resembles a tightly coiled spring. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Rhadamanthus involutus is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
