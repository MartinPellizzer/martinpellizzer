                    <h1>Ricinus communis var. bailundensis</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis var. bailundensis, commonly known as the African castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny calyx that encloses its unique, spiky flower structure. The plant produces seeds that contain high levels of ricin, a toxic protein, making it both valuable and hazardous. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in producing castor oil.</p>
