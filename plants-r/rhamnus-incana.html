<p>Rhamnus incana, commonly known as sandthrift, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish, fuzzy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and low moisture conditions.</p>
<p>Rhamnus incana is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in difficult conditions.</p>
