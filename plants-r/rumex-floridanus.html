<p>Rumex floridanus, commonly known as Florida sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright, glaucous-stemmed foliage with heart-shaped leaves that have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.

<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel.</p>
