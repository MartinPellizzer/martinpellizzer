                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. sordidus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. sordidus, commonly known as the sordid castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its dark, almost black foliage.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a unique leaf coloration due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which give it its distinctive appearance. It is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions, typically found in warm climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, similar to the standard castor bean.</p>
<p>While less commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes, it is valued for its striking foliage and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
