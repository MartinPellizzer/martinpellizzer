<p>Radicula sinuata var. integra, commonly known as the smooth radicula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, sinuous stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment.</p>
