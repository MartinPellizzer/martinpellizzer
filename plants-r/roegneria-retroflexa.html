                    <h1>Roegneria retroflexa</h1>
<p>Roegneria retroflexa, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Roegneria retroflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
