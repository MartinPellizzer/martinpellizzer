                    <h1>Relhania microphylla</h1>
<p>Relhania microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with its host trees, such as Eucalyptus and Acacia, for nutrients and water. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Relhania microphylla plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
