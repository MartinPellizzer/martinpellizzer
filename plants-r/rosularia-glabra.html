<p>Rosularia glabra, commonly known as the naked rosular, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure composed of fleshy, hairless leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Rosularia glabra is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
