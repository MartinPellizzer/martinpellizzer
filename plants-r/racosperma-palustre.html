                    <h1>Racosperma palustre</h1>
<p>Racosperma palustre, commonly known as the swamp acacia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in wet or swampy habitats, often found in coastal areas and seasonally flooded soils.</p>
<p>Racosperma palustre is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems.</p>
