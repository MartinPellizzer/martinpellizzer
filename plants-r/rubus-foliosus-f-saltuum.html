<p>Rubus foliosus f. saltuum, commonly known as the salt marsh raspberry.</p>
<p>This variant of the raspberry plant is adapted to coastal and saline environments, exhibiting salt tolerance through specialized root structures. Its leaves are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the standard Rubus foliosus. The plant produces small, edible berries similar to other raspberries, though they may have a slightly different flavor profile.</p>
