                    <h1>Rumex trisetifer</h1>
<p>Rumex trisetifer, commonly known as the hairy sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a distinctive reddish-brown coloration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, upright stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and streambanks.</p>
