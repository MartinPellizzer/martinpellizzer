                    <h1>Rhodophora</h1>
<p>Rhodophora, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and tidal environments. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help it absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Rhodophora plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of healthy mangrove forests.</p>
