                    <h1>Rosa lintonii</h1>
<p>Rosa lintonii, commonly known as the Linton's rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle red hue at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained soil and cool climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in soft, pale pink to white hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa lintonii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
