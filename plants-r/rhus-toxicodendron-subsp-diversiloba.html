<p>Rhus toxicodendron subsp.</p>
<p>diversiloba, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of nearby plants.</p>
