                    <h1>Rumex ehrenbergii</h1>
<p>Rumex ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert dock, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Rumex ehrenbergii is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
