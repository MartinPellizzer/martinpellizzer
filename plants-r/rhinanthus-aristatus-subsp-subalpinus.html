<p>Rhinanthus aristatus subsp.</p>
<p>subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine yellow rattle, is a herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August.</p>
<p>The plant grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of well-drained, nutrient-poor habitats in alpine environments.</p>
