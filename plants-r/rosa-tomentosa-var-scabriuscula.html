<p>Rosa tomentosa var. scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-stemmed rose, is a shrub-like species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, thorny stems covered in a grayish, woolly pubescence, which gives it its common name. The leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval, serrated leaflets that are often hairy on the upper surface. Its flowers are typically pink to red, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems, and are followed by oval, red-orange hips.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
