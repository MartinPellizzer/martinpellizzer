                    <h1>Rubus × spribilleanus</h1>
<p>Rubus × spribilleanus, commonly known as the Polish raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus idaeus (red raspberry) and Rubus strigosus (bramble).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though some varieties may have yellow or orange berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of genetic variability in its morphology and fruit characteristics.</p>
