<p>Rheedia arubayensis, commonly known as the Aruban rheedia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Aruba in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, palm-like stem and clustered foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in branched inflorescences, often during the dry season. Rheedia arubayensis is adapted to arid conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
