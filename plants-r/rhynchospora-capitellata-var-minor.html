                    <h1>Rhynchospora capitellata var. minor</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora capitellata var. minor, commonly known as the small-headed spikerush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its smaller stature and more compact inflorescences.</p>
