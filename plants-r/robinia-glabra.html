                    <h1>Robinia glabra</h1>
<p>Robinia glabra, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, followed by long, flat pods that contain several seeds. It has a deep root system and is often used in reforestation due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age.</p>
