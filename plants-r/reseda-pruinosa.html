<p>Reseda pruinosa, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Reseda pruinosa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
