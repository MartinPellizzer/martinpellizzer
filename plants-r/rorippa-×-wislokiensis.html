<p>Rorippa × wislokiensis, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rorippa islandica and Rorippa sylvestris.</p>
<p>It is a semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in wetlands, stream margins, and other moist environments. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellow flowers. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on environmental conditions.</p>
