                    <h1>Revwattsia fragilis</h1>
<p>Revwattsia fragilis, commonly known as the fragile revwattsia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, often hairy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to white, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Revwattsia fragilis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
