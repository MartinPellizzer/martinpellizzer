                    <h1>Rhus cirrhiflora</h1>
<p>Rhus cirrhiflora, commonly known as the burr oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and large, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruit clusters that contain one or two seeds. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-tolerant and adaptable to various soil types.</p>
<p>Rhus cirrhiflora is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, playing a significant role in local ecosystems.</p>
