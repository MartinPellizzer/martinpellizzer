<p>Ricinocarpus marginatus, commonly known as the coastal mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense forests in tidal areas. The plant has a buttressed trunk and exudes a milky latex when damaged. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ricinocarpus marginatus plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
