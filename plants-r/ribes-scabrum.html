                    <h1>Ribes scabrum</h1>
<p>Ribes scabrum, commonly known as rough gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters and is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by berries that ripen to a bright orange-red color in late summer. Its berries are edible, though they are generally tart and often used in jams and preserves.</p>
<p>Ribes scabrum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
