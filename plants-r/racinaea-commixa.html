<p>Racinaea commixa, commonly known as the Florida racemose orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are long and narrow, often arising from the base of the plant, and it produces showy, yellow-green flowers during the spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
