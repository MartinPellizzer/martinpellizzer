                    <h1>Ruppia obliqua</h1>
<p>Ruppia obliqua, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a halophytic aquatic plant that thrives in brackish and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Ruppia obliqua is found in coastal areas, estuaries, and shallow waters, often forming dense mats that stabilize sediments.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of intertidal ecosystems.</p>
