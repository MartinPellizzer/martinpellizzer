                    <h1>Raphanus sativus var. rubidus</h1>
<p>Raphanus sativus var. rubidus, commonly known as the red radish, is a cultivar of the radish plant characterized by its deep red or purple skin and crisp, slightly spicy flesh.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage. The plant typically grows to a height of 20–40 cm, with a taproot that is the primary edible part. Its rapid growth cycle allows it to be harvested within 20–30 days after sowing, making it a popular choice for home gardens and commercial cultivation.</p>
<p>The vibrant color of the root is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its nutritional value.</p>
