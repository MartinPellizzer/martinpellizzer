                    <h1>Roegneria transbaicalensis</h1>
<p>Roegneria transbaicalensis, commonly known as the Transbaikal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Siberia and Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clumped) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh, arctic or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Roegneria transbaicalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
