<p>Rhynchospora metralis, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and often hairy. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its flowering stems. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>Rhynchospora metralis is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
