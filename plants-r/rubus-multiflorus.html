<p>Rubus multiflorus, commonly known as the manyflower blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible blackberries that are often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks.</p>
<p>Rubus multiflorus plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
