<p>Ribes oligacanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically reddish-purple when mature, though they are often too tart for direct consumption. Its leaves are elliptical with finely serrated edges, and the stems are covered in short, stiff hairs.</p>
<p>Ribes oligacanthum is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, shaded environments.</p>
