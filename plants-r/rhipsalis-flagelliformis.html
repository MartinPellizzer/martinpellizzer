<p>Rhipsalis flagelliformis, commonly known as the silver hair cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>

It produces small, white or pale green flowers during the rainy season, typically in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
