                    <h1>Rubus progenerans</h1>
<p>Rubus progenerans, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, resembling raspberries but with a more compact structure. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated margins, while its flowers are white and clustered in groups of five.</p>
<p>Rubus progenerans thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and disturbed sites.</p>
