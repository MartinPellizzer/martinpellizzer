                    <h1>Rubus schleicheri var. tomenticarpus</h1>
<p>Rubus schleicheri var. tomenticarpus, commonly known as the woolly-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
