                    <h1>Rhaphidospora anisophylla</h1>
<p>Rhaphidospora anisophylla, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two distinct types of pinnaeâ€”one with smooth margins and the other with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The variability in its frond morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
