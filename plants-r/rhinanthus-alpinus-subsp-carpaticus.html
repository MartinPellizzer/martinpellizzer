<p>Rhinanthus alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>carpaticus, commonly known as the Carpathian flame violet, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the Carpathian Mountains and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native range.</p>
