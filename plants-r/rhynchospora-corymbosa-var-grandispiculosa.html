                    <h1>Rhynchospora corymbosa var. grandispiculosa</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora corymbosa var. grandispiculosa, commonly known as the tall spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features a dense, grass-like appearance with slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its elongated, spiky flower clusters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
