<p>Rhinanthus mediterraneus subsp.</p>
<p>pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in grasslands and open habitats across southern Europe. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its presence can influence the structure and diversity of the surrounding vegetation by reducing the competitiveness of dominant grasses.</p>
