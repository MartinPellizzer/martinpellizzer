                    <h1>Rumicastrum creethae</h1>
<p>Rumicastrum creethae, commonly known as the Creeth's burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, bract-covered fruits that serve as a protective mechanism for its seeds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Rumicastrum creethae is often found in sandy soils and is a component of desert and semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
