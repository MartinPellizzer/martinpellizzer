                    <h1>Rorippa palustris var. sinuata</h1>
<p>Rorippa palustris var. sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous watercress, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features alternate, broadly elliptic to ovate leaves that are often sinuously lobed, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize wet areas make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
