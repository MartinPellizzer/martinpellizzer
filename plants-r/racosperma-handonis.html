<p>Racosperma handonis, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, greyish bark and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by woody pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The Grey Box plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native animals.</p>
