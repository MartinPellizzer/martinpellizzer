<p>Raphanus sativus var. purpureus, commonly known as the purple sprouting broccoli, is a cultivated variant of the wild radish.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact inflorescence of small, purple-bracted flower clusters that resemble broccoli. The plant is typically biennial, though it is often grown as an annual in temperate climates. It thrives in cool weather and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The edible parts include the flower buds, stems, and leaves, which are harvested before the flowers open.</p>
