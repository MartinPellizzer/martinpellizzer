                            <h1>Rhododendron Neriiflorum Subsp. Agetum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron neriiflorum subsp. agetum is a rare and beautiful evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is known for its striking clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. This subspecies is closely related to other rhododendrons but possesses unique characteristics that set it apart. Its foliage is dark green and leathery, providing a lush backdrop for its delicate blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and endangered plant in its natural environment.</p>
