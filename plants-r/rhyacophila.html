                    <h1>Rhyacophila</h1>
<p>Rhyacophila, commonly known as the stonefly, is a genus of aquatic insects belonging to the family Rhyacophilidae.</p>
<p>These insects are typically found in clean, fast-flowing streams and rivers, where they play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems. Their larvae are herbivorous, feeding on algae and detritus, while adults are short-lived and primarily feed on nectar. Rhyacophila species are important indicators of water quality due to their sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>Their presence or absence can provide valuable information about the health of freshwater habitats.</p>
