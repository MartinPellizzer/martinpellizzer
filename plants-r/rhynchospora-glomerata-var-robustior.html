                    <h1>Rhynchospora glomerata var. robustior</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora glomerata var. robustior, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features dense, cylindrical spikelets that are usually reddish-brown in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its robust growth and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
