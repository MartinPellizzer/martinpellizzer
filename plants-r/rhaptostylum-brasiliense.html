<p>Rhaptostylum brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that display a mix of yellow, orange, and red hues, making it highly distinctive. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the undergrowth of dense forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Brazil.</p>
