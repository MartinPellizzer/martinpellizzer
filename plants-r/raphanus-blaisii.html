                    <h1>Raphanus blaisii</h1>
<p>Raphanus blaisii, commonly known as Blais' radish, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typical of the mustard family. Its roots are typically small and not as commercially valuable as those of common radishes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Raphanus blaisii is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
