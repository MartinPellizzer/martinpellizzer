                            <h1>Rhinanthus Pumilus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus pumilus is a small, flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is commonly known as the dwarf yellow rattle and belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. This hemiparasitic species relies on other plants for some of its nutrients while still being able to photosynthesize. Its delicate yellow flowers bloom in early summer, adding a splash of color to meadows and grasslands. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
