                    <h1>Ritchiea heterophylla</h1>
<p>Ritchiea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct variation in leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either pinnate or bipinnate depending on the plant's age and environmental conditions. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, Ritchiea heterophylla is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
