                    <h1>Rotala protracta</h1>
<p>Rotala protracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf waterwheel plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often emerging from the water. Rotala protracta thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a desirable and potentially invasive species in certain aquatic ecosystems.</p>
