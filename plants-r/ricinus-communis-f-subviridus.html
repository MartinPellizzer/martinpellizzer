                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. subviridus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. subviridus, commonly known as the variegated castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically green with white or yellow variegation, creating an ornamental appearance. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It produces unique spiky flower clusters and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its oil-producing properties.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
