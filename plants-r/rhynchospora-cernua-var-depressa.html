<p>Rhynchospora cernua var. depressa, commonly known as the flatleaf beakgrass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes considered a valuable indicator species for wetland health.</p>
