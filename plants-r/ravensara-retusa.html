                    <h1>Ravensara retusa</h1>
<p>Ravensara retusa, commonly known as the New Zealand rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the subtropical regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. Ravensara retusa is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been traditionally used by MƒÅori for carving and tool-making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
