                    <h1>Rhynchosia viscosa var. mollis</h1>
<p>Rhynchosia viscosa var. mollis, commonly known as sticky bower vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, viscid stems that exude a sticky substance, which helps in adhering to supports as it climbs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive winged structure, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>This species is valued in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and growth habit.</p>
