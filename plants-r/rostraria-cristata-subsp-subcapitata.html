<p>Rostraria cristata subsp.</p>
<p>subcapitata, commonly known as the narrow-headed rostraria, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Its subspecies status is due to subtle differences in leaf shape and floral structure compared to the nominate form.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
