<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>idiophyllus, commonly known as the yellow pond-lily, is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy yellow flowers. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>The plant has a branched root system that helps anchor it in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are composed of multiple sepals that resemble petals.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller and more rounded leaves compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus.</p>
