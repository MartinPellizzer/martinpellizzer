<p>Rosa maialis, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Rosa maialis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
