<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>pseudopsis, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that resemble a shield, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant has a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller and more rounded petals compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus.</p>
