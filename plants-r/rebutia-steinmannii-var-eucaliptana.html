<p>Rebutia steinmannii var. eucaliptana, commonly known as the Eucalyptus Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
