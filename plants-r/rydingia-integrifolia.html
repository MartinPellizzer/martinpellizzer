<p>Rydingia integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed rydingia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and saline environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically glabrous and have a waxy coating. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Rydingia integrifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray and wind.</p>
