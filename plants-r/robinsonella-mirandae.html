                    <h1>Robinsonella mirandae</h1>
<p>Robinsonella mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale purple flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its delicate, strap-like leaves are adapted to capture moisture from the humid air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Robinsonella mirandae is considered critically endangered.</p>
