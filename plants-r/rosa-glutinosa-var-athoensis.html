<p>Rosa glutinosa var. athoensis, commonly known as the Athonite rose, is a rare and unique variant of the sticky rose.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Crete, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dense and covered in a sticky substance, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is highly valued in botanical gardens for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance.</p>
