                            <h1>Rosa Abietina Var. Favratii</h1>
<p>Alpine rose, scientifically known as Rosa abietina var. favratii, is a rare and resilient plant that thrives in the high altitudes of the European Alps. This delicate yet hardy shrub is characterized by its fragrant pink flowers and dark green foliage that withstands harsh mountain conditions. Found primarily in rocky soils and alpine meadows, it is a symbol of the rugged beauty of mountain ecosystems. Its limited distribution makes it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike. Despite its small size, the Alpine rose plays a vital role in the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
