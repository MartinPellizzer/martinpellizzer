<p>Ranunculus fallax subsp.</p>
<p>hilarans, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often accompanied by a single central sepal. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
