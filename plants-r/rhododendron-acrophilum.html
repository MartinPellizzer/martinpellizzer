                    <h1>Rhododendron acrophilum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron acrophilum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude environments where temperatures are cooler and the climate is more temperate. The plant typically produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually leathery and dark green, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Rhododendron acrophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
