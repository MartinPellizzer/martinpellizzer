                    <h1>Rosa × rubrosa</h1>
<p>Rosa × rubrosa, commonly known as the deep red hybrid rose, is a popular ornamental plant characterized by its vibrant, deep red flowers.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Rosa rugosa and Rosa chinensis, resulting in a plant that combines the hardiness of the former with the showy blooms of the latter. The shrub typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually borne in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic display to gardens.</p>
<p>Rosa × rubrosa is well-suited for coastal areas due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
