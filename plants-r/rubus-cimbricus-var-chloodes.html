                    <h1>Rubus cimbricus var. chloodes</h1>
<p>Rubus cimbricus var. chloodes, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color, though they are often less flavorful compared to other raspberry varieties. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
