                    <h1>Rhinanthus pseudoantiquus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus pseudoantiquus, commonly known as the false antelopeâ€™s horn, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
