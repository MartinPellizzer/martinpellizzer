<p>Rhipsalis undulata, commonly known as the wavy leaf cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that often trail or climb, and its lanceolate leaves that have a wavy or undulating edge. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis undulata is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
