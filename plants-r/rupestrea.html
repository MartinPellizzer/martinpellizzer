                    <h1>Rupestrea</h1>
<p>Rupestrea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit, often found growing on rocks or trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have narrow, strap-like leaves and produce showy, fragrant flowers in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. Rupestrea species are adapted to grow in nutrient-poor environments, relying on their ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>They are popular among orchid enthusiasts for their unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
