                    <h1>Rhoiacarpos</h1>
<p>Rhoiacarpos, commonly known as the water fern, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Rhoiacarpos plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
