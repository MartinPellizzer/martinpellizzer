<p>Rorippa islandica subsp.</p>
<p>islandica, commonly known as the island cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of the North Atlantic. It thrives in moist, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats, often found in regions with high humidity and frequent exposure to sea spray.</p>
<p>The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, producing a delicate, somewhat clustered inflorescence.</p>
<p>It reproduces primarily through seeds, which are dispersed by water and wind, allowing it to colonize new coastal habitats.</p>
