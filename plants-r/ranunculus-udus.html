                    <h1>Ranunculus udus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus udus, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by five sepals that resemble petals, giving it a double-flower appearance. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and marshes. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed and covered in a waxy coating that helps repel water.</p>
<p>Ranunculus udus is also notable for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its preferred aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
