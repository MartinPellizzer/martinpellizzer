<p>Calcicola subcalva rabdosia, scientifically known as Rabdosia calcicola var. subcalva, is a rare and intriguing plant species found in specific alpine and rocky habitats. This variant of Rabdosia calcicola is characterized by its compact growth and unique adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in regions with limited soil and extreme temperature fluctuations, showcasing remarkable resilience. The plant's small, hairy leaves and pale flowers make it visually distinct from other members of the Lamiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
