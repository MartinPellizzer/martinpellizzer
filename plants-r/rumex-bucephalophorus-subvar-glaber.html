                    <h1>Rumex bucephalophorus subvar. glaber</h1>
<p>Rumex bucephalophorus subvar. glaber, commonly known as the smooth dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and marshy areas. The plant features alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually smooth or only slightly hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This subvariety is distinguished by its smooth leaf surfaces, which set it apart from other varieties within the Rumex genus.</p>
