<p>Rosa stellata subsp.</p>
<p>abyssa, commonly known as the abyssal rose, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to extreme environments. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters. Its leaves are densely packed and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
