<p>Rhododendron tomentosum subsp.</p>
<p>subarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic rhododendron, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against harsh cold temperatures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to alpine and tundra environments due to its frost-resistant properties and slow growth rate.</p>
