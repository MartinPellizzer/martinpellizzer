                    <h1>Roridula</h1>
<p>Roridula, commonly known as the "rain plant," is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky, resinous substance. The plant's leaves are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it retain moisture. Roridula is known for its ability to absorb water through its leaves, which is an adaptation to its arid environment.</p>
<p>It is also notable for its specialized flowers, which are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
