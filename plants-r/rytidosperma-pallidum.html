<p>Rytidosperma pallidum, commonly known as the pale galleta, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Rytidosperma pallidum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
