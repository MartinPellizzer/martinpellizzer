                    <h1>Ranunculus aquatilis var. fissifolius</h1>
<p>Ranunculus aquatilis var. fissifolius, commonly known as the fissile water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. Its flowers are usually yellow with five petals and are borne on short stalks above the water.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its deeply lobed leaves, which give it its scientific name "fissifolius," meaning "split leaf.".</p>
