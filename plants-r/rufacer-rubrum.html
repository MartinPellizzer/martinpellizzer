                    <h1>Rufacer rubrum</h1>
<p>Rufacer rubrum, commonly known as the red-faced fern, is a unique species characterized by its striking crimson undersides on its fronds.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow during the night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Rufacer rubrum lies in its rare ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties.</p>
