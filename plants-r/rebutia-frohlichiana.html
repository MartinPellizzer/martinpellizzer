                    <h1>Rebutia frohlichiana</h1>
<p>Rebutia frohlichiana, commonly known as the Frohlich's ice plant, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the spring and summer months. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically blue-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
