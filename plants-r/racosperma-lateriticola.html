                    <h1>Racosperma lateriticola</h1>
<p>Racosperma lateriticola, commonly known as the lateritic acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, often thorny stems and compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well-suited to poor soils and is often found in rocky or lateritic landscapes.</p>
<p>Racosperma lateriticola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
