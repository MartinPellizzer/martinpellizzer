                    <h1>Raouliopsis</h1>
<p>Raouliopsis, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as pines and kauri. The plant has small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellow flowers followed by small, fleshy berries. Raouliopsis relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while photosynthesis provides it with other necessary resources.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both ecological and economic impacts on the forests it inhabits.</p>
