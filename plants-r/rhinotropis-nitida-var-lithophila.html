                    <h1>Rhinotropis nitida var. lithophila</h1>
<p>Rhinotropis nitida var. lithophila, commonly known as the lithophytic rhinotropis, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which reduces water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in limestone-rich soils and is considered a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces.</p>
