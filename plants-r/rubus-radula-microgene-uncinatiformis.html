                    <h1>Rubus radula microgene uncinatiformis</h1>
<p>Rubus radula microgene uncinatiformis, commonly known as the hooked leaf bramble, is a rare and specialized member of the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and distinctive, hooked bracts that give it its specific epithet. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated margins, and its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
