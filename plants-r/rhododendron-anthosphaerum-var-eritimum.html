                    <h1>Rhododendron anthosphaerum var. eritimum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron anthosphaerum var. eritimum, commonly known as the Eritrean rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the highlands of Eritrea.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soils, often found in forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its botanical features include hairy stems and small, elliptical leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
