                    <h1>Rigiolepis winkleri</h1>
<p>Rigiolepis winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on specific host trees for survival.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which necessitates its parasitic relationship with host species. The plant produces small, white berries that are an important food source for certain bird species. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in the canopies of hardwood trees.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Rigiolepis winkleri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
