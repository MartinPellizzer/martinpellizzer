<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>serratus, commonly known as the serrated goldcup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from other members of the *Ranunculus auricomus* species complex. Native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for garden cultivation, though it requires careful management due to its potential invasiveness.</p>
