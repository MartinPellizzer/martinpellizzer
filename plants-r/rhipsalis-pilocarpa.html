                    <h1>Rhipsalis pilocarpa</h1>
<p>Rhipsalis pilocarpa, commonly known as the white-leafed mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its soft, leaf-like stems that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Unlike typical cacti, it lacks spines and instead relies on its dense foliage for photosynthesis. The plant is often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its flowers, which are typically white or pale green, bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by various insects.</p>
