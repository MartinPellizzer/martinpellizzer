<p>Rhynchosia tenuis, commonly known as the slender cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, slender pods. The plant is characterized by its weak, twining stems and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Rhynchosia tenuis is valued for its edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines, and it also has potential for soil nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
