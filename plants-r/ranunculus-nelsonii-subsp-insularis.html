<p>Ranunculus nelsonii subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the island buttercup, is a rare and endemic species native to the Gal√°pagos Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial with basal leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats, adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the islands. Its flowers have five petals and are often covered in fine hairs, which may aid in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
