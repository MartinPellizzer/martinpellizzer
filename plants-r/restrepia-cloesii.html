<p>Restrepia cloesii, commonly known as the Cloes' restrepia, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
