<p>Rubus aspernatus, commonly known as the rough blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, acidic conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are pinkish-white with five petals.</p>
<p>The fruit, while not as widely cultivated as other blackberries, is edible and has a tart flavor.</p>
