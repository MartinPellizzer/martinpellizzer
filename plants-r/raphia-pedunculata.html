<p>Raphia pedunculata, commonly known as the giant palm or African fan palm, is a large, tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 6 meters in diameter, making it one of the largest palms in the world. The plant grows slowly and can live for several decades, with a trunk that becomes increasingly thick over time. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a significant role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its fruit, which contains a single large seed, is dispersed by animals and contributes to its reproductive success.</p>
