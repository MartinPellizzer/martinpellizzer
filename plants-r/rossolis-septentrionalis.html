                    <h1>Rossolis septentrionalis</h1>
<p>Rossolis septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern rossol, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with woody stems and hairy leaves adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in rocky substrates, while its leaves are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rossolis septentrionalis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
