                    <h1>Roegneria aduoensis</h1>
<p>Roegneria aduoensis, commonly known as the Tibetan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Roegneria aduoensis is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil in alpine and arid regions and serving as a forage plant for grazing animals.</p>
