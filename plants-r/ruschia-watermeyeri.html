<p>Ruschia watermeyeri, commonly known as the Watermeyer's Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
