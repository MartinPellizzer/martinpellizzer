<p>Rumex haematinus, commonly known as red sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish veins in the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are edible and have a tart, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
