<p>Rumex acetosa subsp.</p>
<p>auriculatus, commonly known as the auriculate sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on erect, leafy stems. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions, from full sun to partial shade.</p>
