<p>Rumex pulcher subsp.</p>
<p>raulinii, commonly known as the Raulini's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or bronze in color, which distinguish it from other species in the Rumex genus.</p>

<p>Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation.</p>
