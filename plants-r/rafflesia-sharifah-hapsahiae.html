                    <h1>Rafflesia sharifah-hapsahiae</h1>
<p>Rafflesia sharifah-hapsahiae, commonly known as the Sarawak Rafflesia, is a rare and striking member of the Rafflesia genus, known for its massive, fleshy花朵 that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, typically a Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. The plant is native to the rainforests of Borneo, specifically in the state of Sarawak, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is a symbol of the region's unique biodiversity.</p>
