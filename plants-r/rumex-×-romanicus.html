<p>Rumex × romanicus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broad-leaved sorrel). The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, wetlands, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, greenish flowers that are followed by triangular, red-brown seeds.</p>
