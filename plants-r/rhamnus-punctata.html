                    <h1>Rhamnus punctata</h1>
<p>Rhamnus punctata, commonly known as the spotted buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, often thorned stems and small, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are often marked with distinctive white or pale spots, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>Rhamnus punctata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
