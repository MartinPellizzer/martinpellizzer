                    <h1>Rhinanthus × poeverleinii</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus × poeverleinii, commonly known as the hybrid yellow rattle, is a flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Rhinanthus minor (common yellow rattle) and Rhinanthus glabellus (greater yellow rattle). This plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in grasslands and meadows, where it helps to reduce the competitiveness of grasses by parasitizing them.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
