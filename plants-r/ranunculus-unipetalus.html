                    <h1>Ranunculus unipetalus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus unipetalus, commonly known as the single-petaled buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its single, showy petal that resembles a large, rounded shield, contrasting with its numerous sepals. Native to the high alpine regions of Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
