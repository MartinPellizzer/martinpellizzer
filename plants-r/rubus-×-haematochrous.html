<p>Rubus × haematochrous, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its dark red to black fruits that are typically larger and more flavorful than those of its parent species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries.</p>
<p>The fruit's unique coloration is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its antioxidant properties.</p>
