                    <h1>Rosa celsicola</h1>
<p>Rosa celsicola, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, well-drained soils. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Rosa celsicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions.</p>
