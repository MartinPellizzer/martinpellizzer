<p>Rubus inclinans, commonly known as the leaning blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across the ground. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Rubus inclinans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
