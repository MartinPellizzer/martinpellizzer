<p>Rubus raduliformis, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
