                    <h1>Rhododendron insculptum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron insculptum, commonly known as the engraved rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, doubly serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Rhododendron insculptum is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
