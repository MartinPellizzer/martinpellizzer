                    <h1>Ranunculus reptans var. filiformis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus reptans var. filiformis, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often accompanied by two sepals that resemble additional petals. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
