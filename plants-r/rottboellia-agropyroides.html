                    <h1>Rottboellia agropyroides</h1>
<p>Rottboellia agropyroides, commonly known as false brome, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open areas, such as roadsides and disturbed soils, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread rapidly in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Rottboellia agropyroides is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive growth and adaptability.</p>
