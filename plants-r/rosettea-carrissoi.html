                    <h1>Rosettea carrissoi</h1>
<p>Rosettea carrissoi, commonly known as the Carrizo rosette plant, is a succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It forms dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
