<p>Reynoutria scandens var. dumetorum, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense colonies. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
