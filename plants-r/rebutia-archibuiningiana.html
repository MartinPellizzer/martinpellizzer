<p>Rebutia archibuiningiana, commonly known as the Desert Rose or Ice Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often turn reddish in full sun, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Rebutia archibuiningiana is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
