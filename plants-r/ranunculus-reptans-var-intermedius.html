                    <h1>Ranunculus reptans var. intermedius</h1>
<p>Ranunculus reptans var. intermedius, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, usually appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can outcompete other vegetation.</p>
