                    <h1>Ranunculus atlanticus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions. The plant features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in photosynthesis in its often-salty environment.</p>
<p>Ranunculus atlanticus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
