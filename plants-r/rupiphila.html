                    <h1>Rupiphila</h1>
<p>Rupiphila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique adaptations to rocky and arid environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. Rupiphila species typically have compact, low-growing structures with specialized roots that anchor them to steep surfaces. Their flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often with a greenish or brownish hue.</p>
<p>Due to their specific habitat requirements, many species of Rupiphila are rare and face threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
