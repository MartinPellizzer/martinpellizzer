                    <h1>Reigera maritima</h1>
<p>Reigera maritima, commonly known as the sea reed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and salt marshes. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects along vulnerable coastlines.</p>
