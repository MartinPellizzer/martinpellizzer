<p>Rorippa × terrestris, commonly known as the common yellow water-lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and its flowers are bright yellow with four petals. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Rorippa × terrestris is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
