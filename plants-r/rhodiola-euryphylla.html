                    <h1>Rhodiola euryphylla</h1>
<p>Rhodiola euryphylla, commonly known as the alpine rose or tundra rhodiola, is a perennial plant native to cold, high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in alpine tundras and rocky slopes, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Rhodiola euryphylla is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses.</p>
