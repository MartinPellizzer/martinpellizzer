                    <h1>Ramorinoa girolae</h1>
<p>Ramorinoa girolae, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting specific pollinators like certain species of bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ramorinoa girolae is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
