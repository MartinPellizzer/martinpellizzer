<p>Rhagodia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rhagodia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its compact form and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the winter months, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
