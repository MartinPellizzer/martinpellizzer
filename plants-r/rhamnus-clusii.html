<p>Rhamnus clusii, commonly known as the African buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 3â€“6 meters and has smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are dark blue to black when mature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside.</p>
<p>Rhamnus clusii is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife.</p>
