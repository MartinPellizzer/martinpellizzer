<p>Rumex tuberosus subsp.</p>
<p>creticus, commonly known as Cretan sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The leaves and roots are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation.</p>
