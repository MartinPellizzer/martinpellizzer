                    <h1>Rubus tygartensis</h1>
<p>Rubus tygartensis, commonly known as Tygart's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States, particularly found in moist woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to other Rubus species but are less commonly cultivated. It is characterized by its compound leaves and thorny stems, typical of many brambles.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
