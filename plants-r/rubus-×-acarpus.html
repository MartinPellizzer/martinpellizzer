                    <h1>Rubus × acarpus</h1>
<p>Rubus × acarpus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between blackberries (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberries (Rubus idaeus).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, depending on the variety. These fruits are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Botanically, Rubus × acarpus exhibits traits of both parent species, making it a valuable subject in plant hybridization studies.</p>
