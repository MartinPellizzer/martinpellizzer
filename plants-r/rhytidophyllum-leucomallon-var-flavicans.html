                    <h1>Rhytidophyllum leucomallon var. flavicans</h1>
<p>Rhytidophyllum leucomallon var. flavicans, commonly known as the yellow-flowered tuckahoe, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique, shrub-like growth habit with thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. Its botanical features include a deep root system that helps it survive in moist, swampy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
