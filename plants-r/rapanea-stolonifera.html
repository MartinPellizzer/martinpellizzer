                    <h1>Rapanea stolonifera</h1>
<p>Rapanea stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping holly, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are a common food source for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread along the forest floor, forming dense mats.</p>
