<p>Rhinanthus serotinus subsp.</p>
<p>cretaceus, commonly known as the Cretaceous yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its historical distribution suggests a possible connection to the Cretaceous period, hence its common name.</p>
