                    <h1>Rubus koehleri microgene polyoplon</h1>
<p>Rubus koehleri microgene polyoplon, commonly known as the coastal raspberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to coastal environments and its limited distribution.</p>
