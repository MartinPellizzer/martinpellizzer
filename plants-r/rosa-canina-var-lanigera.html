<p>Rosa canina var. lanigera, commonly known as the hairy rose or bristly dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover the stems, leaves, and flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red hips in autumn. Its foliage is typically dark green and slightly serrated, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators.</p>
