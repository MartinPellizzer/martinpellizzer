                    <h1>Rubus × adjunctus</h1>
<p>Rubus × adjunctus, commonly known as the blackberry-raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus ideaus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parent species. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart and sweet flavor profile. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for breeding programs aimed at improving fruit quality and disease resistance.</p>
