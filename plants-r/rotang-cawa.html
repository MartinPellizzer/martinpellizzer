<p>Rotang cawa, commonly known as *Dendrocnide moroides*, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous stems and is often found in rainforests and moist woodlands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in fine, stinging hairs that can cause severe skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>Rotang cawa is valued for its strong, durable fibers, which have been traditionally used by Indigenous communities for basket-making and other crafts.</p>
