                    <h1>Rubus idaeus f. albus</h1>
<p>Rubus idaeus f. albus, commonly known as white raspberry, is a botanical variant of the red raspberry plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white flowers and pale pink to white berries, which are less tart than the typical red raspberry. This form is a natural mutation that occurs in certain regions where the plant grows. The leaves are similar to those of the standard raspberry, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>While not as widely cultivated as the common raspberry, it is appreciated for its unique appearance and mild flavor.</p>
