                    <h1>Rhabdia fluvialis</h1>
<p>Rhabdia fluvialis, commonly known as the river spleenwort, is a small, aquatic moss that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on submerged or partially submerged stones and logs in streams and rivers. The plant has a delicate, branching structure with specialized cells that help it absorb nutrients from the water. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, develop from the gametophyte stage and release spores into the water.</p>
<p>Rhabdia fluvialis plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
