<p>Rubus karstianus, commonly known as the Karst raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, thriving in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruits are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other raspberry species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas.</p>
