                    <h1>Rubus rosifolius f. simpliciflorus</h1>
<p>Rubus rosifolius f. simpliciflorus, commonly known as the simple-flowered rosehip bush, is a botanical variant of the rose family (Rosaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, trifoliate leaves and reduced floral structure compared to the typical Rubus species. The plant produces small, red berries that are similar to those of other Rubus species but are less common in the wild. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique floral morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant variation.</p>
