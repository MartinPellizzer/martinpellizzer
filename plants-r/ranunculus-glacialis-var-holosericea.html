                    <h1>Ranunculus glacialis var. holosericea</h1>
<p>Ranunculus glacialis var. holosericea, commonly known as the glacial buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically borne on slender, hairy stems. The leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This variant is distinguished by its particularly long, silky hairs on the stem and sepals, giving it a more refined appearance than the typical form.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and stream banks.</p>
