<p>Rhinanthus crus-galli, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species that attaches to the roots of grasses and other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, typically in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and consist of two lips, with the upper lip being shorter than the lower lip.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus crus-galli plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
