<p>Rhinanthus pumilus subsp.</p>
<p>apuanus, commonly known as the Apuanan yellow-rattle, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its small size and specialized ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
