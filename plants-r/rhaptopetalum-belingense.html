                    <h1>Rhaptopetalum belingense</h1>
<p>Rhaptopetalum belingense, commonly known as the Bornean star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically a vibrant mix of white and pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the dense canopy of the tropical forest. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
