                    <h1>Rubus schmidelioides var. subpauperatus</h1>
<p>Rubus schmidelioides var. subpauperatus, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruits are aggregate berries that develop from the fusion of multiple small drupes.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs and smaller, more slender stems compared to other Rubus species.</p>
