                    <h1>Rosa canina var. thuillieri</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. thuillieri, commonly known as the Thuillier's dog rose, is a rare variant of the dog rose native to southern France.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa canina species. The plant produces small, red, edible hips that are similar to those of the common dog rose. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and hedgerows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
