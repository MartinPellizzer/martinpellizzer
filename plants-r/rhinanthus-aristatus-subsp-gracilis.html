<p>Rhinanthus aristatus subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as the slender yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often forming dense clusters.</p>
<p>Its slender stems and delicate appearance make it a distinctive yet relatively rare species in the wild.</p>
