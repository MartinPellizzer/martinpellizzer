<p>Rhynchosinapis transtagana, commonly known as the goldenrod leafhopper, is a small insect belonging to the family Cicadellidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body and distinctive golden-green coloration, which helps it blend with its host plants. This species primarily feeds on the sap of plants in the Asteraceae family, particularly goldenrod and related species. Its feeding behavior can cause stippling on leaves, which may affect the plant's growth.</p>
<p>The life cycle of Rhynchosinapis transtagana includes several nymphal stages before reaching adulthood, typically completing development within a single growing season.</p>
