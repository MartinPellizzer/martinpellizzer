<p>Roegneria ciliaris var. submutica, commonly known as the rough meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers.

<p>Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
