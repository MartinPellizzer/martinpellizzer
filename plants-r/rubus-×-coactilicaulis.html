                    <h1>Rubus × coactilicaulis</h1>
<p>Rubus × coactilicaulis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, with a tangy flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in wetland or bog environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is generally sterile and does not produce viable seeds.</p>
