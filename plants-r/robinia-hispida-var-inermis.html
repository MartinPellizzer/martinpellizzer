                    <h1>Robinia hispida var. inermis</h1>
<p>Robinia hispida var. inermis, commonly known as the softleaf false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its foliage is often described as soft and velvety, distinguishing it from other species in the Robinia genus.</p>
<p>This variety is less prickly than the typical Robinia hispida, making it more suitable for ornamental use in gardens.</p>
