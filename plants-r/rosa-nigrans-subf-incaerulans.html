<p>Rosa nigrans subf.</p>
<p>incaerulans, commonly known as the blue-black rose, is a rare and striking variant of the Rosa nigrans species. It is characterized by its deep, almost black petals that often appear blue under certain light conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and produces fragrant, single flowers.</p>
<p>Its unique coloration and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
