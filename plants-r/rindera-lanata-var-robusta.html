<p>Rindera lanata var. robusta, commonly known as the woolly rindera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of yellow or green, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
