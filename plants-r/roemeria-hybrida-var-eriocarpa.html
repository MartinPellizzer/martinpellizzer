                    <h1>Roemeria hybrida var. eriocarpa</h1>
<p>Roemeria hybrida var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the velvetleaf roemeria, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft-textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
