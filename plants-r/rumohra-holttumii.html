                    <h1>Rumohra holttumii</h1>
<p>Rumohra holttumii, commonly known as the holttumii fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology.</p>
<p>The leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait in ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
