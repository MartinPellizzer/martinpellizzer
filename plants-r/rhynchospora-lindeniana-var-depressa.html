                    <h1>Rhynchospora lindeniana var. depressa</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora lindeniana var. depressa, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the margins of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It is characterized by its low, compact growth habit and is often adapted to fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from other rhynchospora species by its shorter stature and specific habitat preferences.</p>
