                    <h1>Rubus × semigremlii</h1>
<p>Rubus × semigremlii, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant produces small, red to orange berries that are typically tart and acidic, with a complex flavor profile. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological and genetic variability.</p>
