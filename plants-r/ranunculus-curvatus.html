<p>It features a basal rosette of hairy, kidney-shaped leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, which are typically not true petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Ranunculus curvatus is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
