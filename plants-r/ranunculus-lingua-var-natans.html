<p>Ranunculus lingua var. natans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a water plant characterized by its floating leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The leaves are typically divided into lobes and remain buoyant on the water's surface. Its flowers, which appear in early spring, have five petals and are often accompanied by numerous stamens.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other ranunculus species by its unique aquatic adaptation and reproductive strategies.</p>
