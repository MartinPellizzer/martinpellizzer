                    <h1>Rapicactus × anomalus</h1>
<p>Rapicactus × anomalus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between a Hylocereus species and a genus of cacti.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique appearance, with a colorful, non-photosynthetic upper portion and a green, photosynthetic lower part. The plant is native to Mexico and thrives in warm, arid climates with well-draining soil. It requires minimal water and full sun to flourish, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is typically propagated through grafting rather than seeds.</p>
