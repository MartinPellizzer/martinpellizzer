                    <h1>Retrophyllum comptonii</h1>
<p>Retrophyllum comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's retrophyllum, is a rare and unusual plant native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to arid environments, including succulent leaves that store water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and botanical research.</p>
