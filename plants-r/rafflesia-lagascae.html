                    <h1>Rafflesia lagascae</h1>
<p>Rafflesia lagascae, commonly known as the "Bornean corpse flower," is a parasitic plant found in the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling rotting meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia lagascae is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native ecosystem.</p>
