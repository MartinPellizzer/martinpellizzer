The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect spikes. Its leaves are often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in wet environments.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ecological importance as a food source for various insects and as a component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
