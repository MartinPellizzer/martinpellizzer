<p>Rubus steudneri var. aberensis, commonly known as Abernethy bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to the UK.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, juicy berries in the summer. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected plant in certain regions.</p>
