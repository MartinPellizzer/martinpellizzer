                            <h1>Ricinocarpus Portoricensis</h1>
<p>Ricinocarpus portoricensis is a rare and unique plant species native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is known for its distinctive morphology and ecological significance. This plant thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it faces threats of extinction, making conservation efforts critical for its survival. Its study provides valuable insights into the biodiversity and ecological dynamics of Puerto Rico's flora.</p>
