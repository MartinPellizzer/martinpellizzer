                    <h1>Ricinus pulchellus</h1>
<p>Ricinus pulchellus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with a soft, velvety texture and its spiny calyces that encase the fruit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
