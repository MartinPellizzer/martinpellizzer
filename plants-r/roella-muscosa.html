                    <h1>Roella muscosa</h1>
<p>Roella muscosa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Roella muscosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to adapt to challenging growing conditions.</p>
