                    <h1>Rumex × hybridus</h1>
<p>Rumex × hybridus, commonly known as garden sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in gardens, waste areas, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in cultivated landscapes.</p>
