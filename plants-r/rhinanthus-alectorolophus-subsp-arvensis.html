<p>Rhinanthus alectorolophus subsp.</p>
<p>arvensis, commonly known as the field rhinoceros flower, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange-red flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and arable fields. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and declining species in many parts of its native range.</p>
