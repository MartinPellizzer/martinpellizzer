<p>Radyera urens, commonly known as the common stinkcup, is a small, annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, hairy stems, and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Radyera urens is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its mild stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid spread.</p>
