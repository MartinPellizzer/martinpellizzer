                    <h1>Restrepia leopardina var. rosea</h1>
<p>Restrepia leopardina var. rosea, commonly known as the pink-leaved bromeliad, is a hybrid variety of the Restrepia genus native to the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink foliage with a waxy texture, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of its parent species. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the base of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
