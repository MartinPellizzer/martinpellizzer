                <h1>Rubus micaschistosus</h1>
<p>Rubus micaschistosus, commonly known as the micaschist blackberry, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions with mica-rich schist soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple berries that are highly sought after for their intense flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a humid climate with partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
