                    <h1>Ranunculus lappaceus var. plebeius</h1>
<p>Ranunculus lappaceus var. plebeius, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are palmately divided with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petals. The plant produces small, green, follicle-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and preference for high-altitude environments, it is considered a characteristic species of alpine flora.</p>
