                    <h1>Rhizobotrya</h1>
<p>Rhizobotrya, commonly known as the "bark lichen," is a type of lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark surfaces of trees, where it thrives in moist and shaded environments. The plant's structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate. Rhizobotrya is characterized by its ability to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment through its fungal component.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and is often used as an indicator of air quality in forest ecosystems.</p>
