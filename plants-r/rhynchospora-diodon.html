<p>Rhynchospora diodon, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
