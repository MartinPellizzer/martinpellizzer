<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>naguensis, commonly known as the Tibetan buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive auricle-like structure on the petals, which gives it its species name.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, cool environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
