<p>Ranunculus purshii var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to colonize moist, disturbed soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it often forms dense mats in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
