<p>Rhynchosia erythrinoides, commonly known as the red-flowered burr legume, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It produces striking red or orange flowers that are often clustered in groups of three, giving it a vibrant and eye-catching appearance. The plant has compound leaves with pairs of oval-shaped leaflets and bears fruit that develops into a spiny, three-lobed burr. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
