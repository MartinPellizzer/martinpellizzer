<p>It features small, fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
