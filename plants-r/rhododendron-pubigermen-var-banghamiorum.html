                    <h1>Rhododendron pubigermen var. banghamiorum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron pubigermen var. banghamiorum, commonly known as the Bangham's alpine rhododendron, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained, acidic soils, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its narrow leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
