                    <h1>Ricinus communis subvar. erythrocladus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis subvar. erythrocladus, commonly known as the bloodleaf castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking red and green foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Its leaves are often used in ornamental gardening due to their vibrant coloration.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful handling due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin in its seeds.</p>
