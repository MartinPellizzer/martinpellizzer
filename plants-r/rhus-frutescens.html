                    <h1>Rhus frutescens</h1>
<p>Rhus frutescens, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Smooth sumac is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
