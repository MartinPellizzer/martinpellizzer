<p>Rhododendron cloiophorum subsp.</p>
<p>mannophorum, commonly known as the Sierra Madre rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its pale pink to lavender-colored petals and a unique floral structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
