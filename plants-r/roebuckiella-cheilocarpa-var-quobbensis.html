                    <h1>Roebuckiella cheilocarpa var. quobbensis</h1>
<p>Roebuckiella cheilocarpa var. quobbensis, commonly known as the Quobbens rock-dove, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing shrub form with dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
