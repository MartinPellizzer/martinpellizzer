<p>Richterago angustifolia, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Richterago angustifolia is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
