<p>Relbunium hypocarpium subsp.</p>
<p>fluminense, commonly known as the Brazilian bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of South America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water movement and light absorption.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
