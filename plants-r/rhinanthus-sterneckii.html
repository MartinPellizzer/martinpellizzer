                    <h1>Rhinanthus sterneckii</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus sterneckii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Its presence can help promote biodiversity by reducing the dominance of certain plant species in its environment.</p>
