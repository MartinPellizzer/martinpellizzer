<p>Ranunculus aquatilis subsp.</p>
<p>penicillatus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, streams, and lakes, often in muddy or silty substrates.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water, and it produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. Its root system is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
