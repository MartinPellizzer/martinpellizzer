                    <h1>Rosa oreinosa</h1>
<p>Rosa oreinosa, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Rosa oreinosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat.</p>
