                    <h1>Ricinocarpus laxiflorus</h1>
<p>Ricinocarpus laxiflorus, commonly known as the slender-flowered ricin tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and the presence of ricin, a potent toxin found in its seeds.</p>
