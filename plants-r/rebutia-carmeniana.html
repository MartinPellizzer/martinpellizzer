<p>Rebutia carmeniana, commonly known as the Carmenian Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes.</p>
