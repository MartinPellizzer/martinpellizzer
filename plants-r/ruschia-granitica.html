                    <h1>Ruschia granitica</h1>
<p>Ruschia granitica, commonly known as the granite ruischia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically blue-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ruschia granitica is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
