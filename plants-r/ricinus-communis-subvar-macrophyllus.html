                    <h1>Ricinus communis subvar. macrophyllus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis subvar. macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant castor bean, is a striking plant characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant green foliage and unique floral structure.</p>
<p>However, due to the toxicity of its seeds, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled environments.</p>
