<p>Rubus micans subsp.</p>
<p>subrotundus, commonly known as the glossy blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it cling to supports.</p>

<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits.</p>
