                    <h1>Rumex maritimus var. athrix</h1>
<p>Rumex maritimus var. athrix, commonly known as sea sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically red or purple in color, which help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and is often found in moist, saline habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate salt and wind, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
