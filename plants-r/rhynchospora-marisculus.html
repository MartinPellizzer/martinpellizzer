                    <h1>Rhynchospora marisculus</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora marisculus, commonly known as sea meadow grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. This plant typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands, often in tidal areas, and is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Rhynchospora marisculus produces small, clustered flower heads that are usually pale green to brown, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed coastal ecosystems.</p>
