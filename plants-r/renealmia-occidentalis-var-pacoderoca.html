<p>Renealmia occidentalis var. pacoderoca, commonly known as the Pacific reed, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, saline environments such as tidal flats and mangrove swamps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in coastal areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear, grass-like, and often covered in a fine, silky pubescence.</p>
