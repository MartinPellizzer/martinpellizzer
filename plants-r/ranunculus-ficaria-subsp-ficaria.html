<p>Ranunculus ficaria subsp.</p>
<p>ficaria, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed in garden settings.</p>
