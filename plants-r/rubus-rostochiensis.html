                    <h1>Rubus rostochiensis</h1>
<p>Rubus rostochiensis, commonly known as the Rostochian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus genus.</p>
