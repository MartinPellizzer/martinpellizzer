                    <h1>Rhinanthus crista-galli var. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus crista-galli var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in open habitats and is considered a hemi-parasite with specific ecological interactions.</p>
