                    <h1>Ranunculus repens var. villosus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus repens var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, often disturbed habitats such as meadows, ditches, and riverbanks. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss and provide protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other ranunculus species but is distinguished by its dense pubescence and specific habitat preferences.</p>
