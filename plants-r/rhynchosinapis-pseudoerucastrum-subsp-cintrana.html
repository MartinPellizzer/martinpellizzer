<p>Rhynchosinapis pseudoerucastrum subsp.</p>
<p>cintrana, commonly known as the Cintrana thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branched inflorescence that bears yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a distinctive crown of leaves that form a basal rosette.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
