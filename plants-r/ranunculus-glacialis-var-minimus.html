<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or scree habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare and fragile species.</p>
