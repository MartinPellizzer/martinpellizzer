                    <h1>Roupala loranthoides</h1>
<p>Roupala loranthoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used in carving and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
