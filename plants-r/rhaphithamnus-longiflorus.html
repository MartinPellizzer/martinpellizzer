<p>Rhaphithamnus longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered rhaphithamnus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Rhaphithamnus longiflorus plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
