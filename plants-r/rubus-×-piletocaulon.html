                    <h1>Rubus × piletocaulon</h1>
<p>Rubus × piletocaulon, commonly known as the blackberry- raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves.</p>
<p>It produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries that ripen to a deep red or black color. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. It has a complex hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between Rubus species such as Rubus ursinus and Rubus idaeus.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural breeding programs.</p>
