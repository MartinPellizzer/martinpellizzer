<p>Rubus louettensis, commonly known as the Louett's raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other raspberry species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied member of the Rubus genus.</p>
