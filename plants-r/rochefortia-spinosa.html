<p>Rochefortia spinosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and orb-shaped clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Rochefortia spinosa is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
