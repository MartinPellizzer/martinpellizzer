<p>Rosa pomifera subsp.</p>
<p>mollis, commonly known as the soft-fruited rose, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, followed by large, fleshy, edible fruits known as rose hips. These fruits are particularly notable for their size and soft, pulpy texture, which distinguishes this subspecies from others in the Rosa genus.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fruit in traditional medicine and culinary uses.</p>
