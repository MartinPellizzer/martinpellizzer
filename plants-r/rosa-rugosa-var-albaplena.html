                    <h1>Rosa rugosa var. albaplena</h1>
<p>Rosa rugosa var. albaplena, commonly known as the white-flowered rugosa rose, is a vigorous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, broad ovate leaves, and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and tolerating salt spray, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its hardy nature and ability to produce hips, which are edible and ornamental, add to its horticultural value.</p>
<p>However, its aggressive growth can make it invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>
