<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>apiculatus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 petals, which bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies apiculatus is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaf tips and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical form of R. auricomus.</p>
