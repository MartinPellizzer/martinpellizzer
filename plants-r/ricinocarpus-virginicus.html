<p>Ricinocarpus virginicus, commonly known as the coastal banyan, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spreading canopy and aerial roots that help it anchor to rocky or coastal substrates. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The tree plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various species.</p>
