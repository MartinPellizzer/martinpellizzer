                    <h1>Riocreuxia profusa</h1>
<p>Riocreuxia profusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
