                    <h1>Rhodax canus</h1>
<p>Rhodax canus, commonly known as the silverleaf rhodax, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Rhodax canus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
