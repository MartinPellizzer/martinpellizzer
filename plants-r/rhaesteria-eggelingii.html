<p>Rhaesteria eggelingii, commonly known as the Eggeling's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Rhaesteria eggelingii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
