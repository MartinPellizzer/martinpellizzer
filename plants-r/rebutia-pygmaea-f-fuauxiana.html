<p>Rebutia pygmaea f. fuauxiana, commonly known as the Fuaux's miniature rebutia, is a compact cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in dense, white to pale blue tubercles. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a prized addition to succulent collections.</p>
