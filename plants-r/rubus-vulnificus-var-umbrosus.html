                    <h1>Rubus vulnificus var. umbrosus</h1>
<p>Rubus vulnificus var. umbrosus, commonly known as the shadow blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to shaded, moist woodlands.</p>
<p>It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less palatable than those of other Rubus species. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of understory ecosystems in temperate regions.</p>
