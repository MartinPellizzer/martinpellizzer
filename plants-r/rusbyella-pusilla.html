                    <h1>Rusbyella pusilla</h1>
<p>Rusbyella pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sunburst lichen, is a small, foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive yellowish-green to pale orange thallus with a granular texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides its primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis. Rusbyella pusilla is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and delicate structure make it a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
