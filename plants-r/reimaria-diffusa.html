                    <h1>Reimaria diffusa</h1>
<p>Reimaria diffusa, commonly known as the broadleaf reindeer lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It features a dense, leaf-like thallus with a dark green to black upper surface and a white to yellowish lower surface. The plant is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and green algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator of ecological health.</p>
