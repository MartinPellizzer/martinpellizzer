<p>Roegneria longiglumis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Roegneria longiglumis is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to thrive in harsh environments and support local biodiversity.</p>
