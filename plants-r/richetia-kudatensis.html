                    <h1>Richetia kudatensis</h1>
<p>Richetia kudatensis, commonly known as the Kudat fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions. Its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Richetia kudatensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
