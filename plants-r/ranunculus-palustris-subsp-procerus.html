<p>Ranunculus palustris subsp.</p>
<p>procerus, commonly known as the tall water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, supporting palmately divided, bright yellow flowers with numerous stamens.</p>
<p>The leaves are deeply lobed and typically have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist environments. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its elongated, slender appearance compared to the more compact form of the main species.</p>
