                    <h1>Rubus radula var. pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Rubus radula var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf dewberry, is a small, trailing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, edible berries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, silvery hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Rubus species but is distinguished by its exceptionally small size and unique habitat preferences.</p>
