                    <h1>Rottboellia foveolata</h1>
<p>Rottboellia foveolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed.</p>
