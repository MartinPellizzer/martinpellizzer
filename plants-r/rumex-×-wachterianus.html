                    <h1>Rumex × wachterianus</h1>
<p>Rumex × wachterianus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple underside, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
