                    <h1>Rubus senticosus</h1>
<p>Rubus senticosus, commonly known as cascara sagrada, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces red or yellow berries that are rich in anthraquinones, which have been used in traditional medicine. Its roots and bark contain compounds that act as a laxative, making it historically significant in herbal remedies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in some regions.</p>
