<p>Rubus × medioximus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chinensis (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor and a juicy texture. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, though it can be somewhat invasive in certain regions.</p>
