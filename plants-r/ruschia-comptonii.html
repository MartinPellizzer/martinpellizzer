                    <h1>Ruschia comptonii</h1>
<p>Ruschia comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
