                    <h1>Rhizophora mucronata var. alokii</h1>
<p>Rhizophora mucronata var. alokii, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a variant of the red mangrove species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive aerial roots, which provide structural support and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water, aiding in its spread along shorelines. Its leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life.</p>
