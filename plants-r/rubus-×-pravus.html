<p>Rubus × pravus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus ideaus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
