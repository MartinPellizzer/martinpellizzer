<p>Romulea bulbocodium subsp.</p>
<p>pylia, commonly known as the Pyrenean romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that serve as storage organs and are essential for its survival in harsh alpine conditions. It typically blooms in spring and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
