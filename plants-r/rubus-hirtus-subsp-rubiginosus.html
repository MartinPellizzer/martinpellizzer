<p>Rubus hirtus subsp.</p>
<p>rubiginosus, commonly known as the rusty blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark red berries in the summer. The berries are often used in jams and pies, though they are generally smaller and less flavorful than other blackberry varieties.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
