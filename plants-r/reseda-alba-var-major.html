<p>Reseda alba var. major, commonly known as white madder, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a yellow to orange dye from its roots, which has been historically used in textile industries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its historical use as a natural dye source and its role in traditional plant-based coloration.</p>
