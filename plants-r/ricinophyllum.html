<p>Ricinophyllum, commonly known as the poison ivy vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its most notable feature is the presence of a toxic sap containing ricin, which can cause severe skin irritation.</p>
<p>Ricinophyllum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
