<p>Ricinocarpos crispatus, commonly known as the curly podded fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated fronds that are often curled or rolled when young. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to regions of South America.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in the study of fern botany.</p>
