                    <h1>Rhaphidorhynchus cornutus</h1>
<p>Rhaphidorhynchus cornutus, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, with a distinctive horn-like projection on the calyx.</p>
<p>Rhaphidorhynchus cornutus is a semi-aquatic plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by controlling microfauna populations.</p>
