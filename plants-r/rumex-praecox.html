                    <h1>Rumex praecox</h1>
<p>Rumex praecox, commonly known as early sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in reddish hairs, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during early spring, before the leaves fully develop. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
<p>Rumex praecox is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
