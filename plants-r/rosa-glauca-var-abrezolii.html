                    <h1>Rosa glauca var. abrezolii</h1>
<p>Rosa glauca var. abrezolii, commonly known as the Abrezolii rock rose, is a rare and hardy shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, thorny stems and produces clusters of pale blue to lilac flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
