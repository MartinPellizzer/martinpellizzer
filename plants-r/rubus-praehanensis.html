                    <h1>Rubus praehanensis</h1>
<p>Rubus praehanensis, commonly known as the prehistoric raspberry, is a rare and ancient species of bramble native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, thorny stems, and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, Rubus praehanensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
