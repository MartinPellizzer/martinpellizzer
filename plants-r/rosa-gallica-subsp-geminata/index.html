                            <h1>Rosa Gallica Subsp. Geminata</h1>
<p>Rosa gallica subsp. geminata is a rare and elegant member of the rose family known for its delicate pink blooms and historical significance. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its double flowers and fragrant scent have made it a prized ornamental plant throughout history. Despite its beauty, it is now considered endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical gem.</p>
