<p>Rhamnus lycioides subsp.</p>
<p>lycioides, commonly known as the desert buckthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by reddish-black berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
