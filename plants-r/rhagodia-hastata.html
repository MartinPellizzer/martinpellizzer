                    <h1>Rhagodia hastata</h1>
<p>Rhagodia hastata, commonly known as the Narrow-leafed Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Rhagodia hastata is often used in rehabilitation of degraded lands due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
