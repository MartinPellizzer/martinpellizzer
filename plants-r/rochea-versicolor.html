                    <h1>Rochea versicolor</h1>
<p>Rochea versicolor, commonly known as the variable rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, depending on the variety. Its leaves are typically blue-gray and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rochea versicolor is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
