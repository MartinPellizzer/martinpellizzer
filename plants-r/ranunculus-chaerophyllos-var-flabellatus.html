<p>Ranunculus chaerophyllos var. flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble a fan shape. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
