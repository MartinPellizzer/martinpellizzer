                    <h1>Rubus tomentosus var. schultzii</h1>
<p>Rubus tomentosus var. schultzii, commonly known as the Schultze bramble, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a grayish-white underside due to the presence of fine, woolly hairs. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests.</p>
