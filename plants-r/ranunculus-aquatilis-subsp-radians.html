<p>Ranunculus aquatilis subsp.</p>
<p>radians, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its bright yellow flowers and finely divided leaves. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients. Its flowers are often short-lived, blooming in early spring before the water temperature rises.</p>
<p>The subspecies radians is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to other forms of Ranunculus aquatilis.</p>
