                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. zebrinus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. zebrinus, commonly known as the zebra castor plant, is a unique variant of the castor oil plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a distinctive zebra-like pattern of green and yellow. This ornamental plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>While it is primarily grown for its aesthetic appeal, it can also produce seeds similar to the common castor plant, though its seed production is generally less abundant.</p>
