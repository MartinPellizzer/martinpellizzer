<p>Rorippa islandica f. tetrapoma, commonly known as the island watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to northern regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and stream edges. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The tetrapoma form is distinguished by its tetraploid chromosome count, which contributes to its unique growth characteristics.</p>
