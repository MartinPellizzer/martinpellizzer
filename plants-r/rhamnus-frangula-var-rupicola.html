                    <h1>Rhamnus frangula var. rupicola</h1>
<p>Rhamnus frangula var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock-frangula, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid or disturbed landscapes.</p>
