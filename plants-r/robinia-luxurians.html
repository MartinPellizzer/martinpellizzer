<p>Robinia luxurians, commonly known as the Spanish black locust, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a leathery texture. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the spring. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for carpentry and fuel.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species.</p>
