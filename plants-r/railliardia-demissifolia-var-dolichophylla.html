The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a subtle purple hue at the base. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
