                    <h1>Rhigiocarya racemifera</h1>
<p>Rhigiocarya racemifera, commonly known as the racemifera cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its ancient lineage, dating back to the Mesozoic era.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological importance, it is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat.</p>
