<p>Rupiphila tachiroei, commonly known as the Tachiroe rock fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are adapted to its harsh, high-altitude habitat. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rupiphila tachiroei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
