<p>Rubus arduennensis var. cedrorum, commonly known as the Cedrorum blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to specific regions in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and have a slightly tart flavor. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it produces thorny stems typical of many Rubus species.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and limited distribution.</p>
