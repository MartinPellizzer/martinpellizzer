                    <h1>Rhinanthus grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the common yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus grandiflorus is often found in the UK and parts of Europe, where it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
