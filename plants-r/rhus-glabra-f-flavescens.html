<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves and berries contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine, though they can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in woodland edges and open fields.</p>
