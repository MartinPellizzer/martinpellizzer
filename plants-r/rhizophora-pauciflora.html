                    <h1>Rhizophora pauciflora</h1>
<p>Rhizophora pauciflora, commonly known as the mangrove fern or red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree found in tropical coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aerial roots, which help in anchoring the plant and facilitating gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense forests in coastal areas. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rhizophora pauciflora plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
