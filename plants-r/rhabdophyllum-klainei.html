                    <h1>Rhabdophyllum klainei</h1>
<p>Rhabdophyllum klainei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant relies on specific host trees for support and derives its nutrients from the air and rain rather than soil. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical wonder.</p>
