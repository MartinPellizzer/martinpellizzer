<p>Rhodognaphalon mossambicense, commonly known as the Mozambique rhodognaphalon, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems with leafy shoots that are often covered in a thin layer of translucent cuticle. Its leaves are typically elongated and gradually taper to a point, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Rhodognaphalon mossambicense is found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest understories.</p>
