<p>Ritterocactus mueller-melchersii subsp.</p>
<p>winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's ritterocactus, is a rare and unique cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stems covered in dense, white to pale green tubercles, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
