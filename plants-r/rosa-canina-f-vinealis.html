<p>Rosa canina f. vinealis, commonly known as the climbing dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing stems that can climb or trail along the ground, making it suitable for hedging or ground cover. The plant produces small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its hips, like those of Rosa canina, are edible and contain high levels of vitamin C. This form is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
