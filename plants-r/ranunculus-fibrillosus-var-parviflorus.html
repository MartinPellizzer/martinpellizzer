                    <h1>Ranunculus fibrillosus var. parviflorus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus fibrillosus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered water crowfoot, is a delicate aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, producing a cluster of stamens that surround a central pistil.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its compact size and is often found in association with other aquatic flora in still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
