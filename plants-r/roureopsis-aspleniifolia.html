                    <h1>Roureopsis aspleniifolia</h1>
<p>Roureopsis aspleniifolia, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a delicate fern native to the wet tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that resemble those of the asplenium genus, hence its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a soft, velvety texture, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings.</p>
