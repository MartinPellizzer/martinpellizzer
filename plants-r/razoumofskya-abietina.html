                    <h1>Razoumofskya abietina</h1>
<p>Razoumofskya abietina, commonly known as the white pine lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and boreal forest environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to bright green thallus, which often has a velvety texture. The lichen forms symbiotic relationships with algae, primarily Trebouxia species, which provide the photosynthetic capability. It typically grows on the bark of coniferous trees, especially white pines, and is often found in moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and forest health.</p>
