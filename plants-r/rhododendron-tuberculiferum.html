<p>Rhododendron tuberculiferum, commonly known as the mountain rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Rhododendron tuberculiferum is often found in forested areas at high altitudes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem.</p>
