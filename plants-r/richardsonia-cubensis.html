                    <h1>Richardsonia cubensis</h1>
<p>Richardsonia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Richardsonia cubensis is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
