                    <h1>Ranunculus acaulis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus acaulis, commonly known as the cushion buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually divided into lobes and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which aid in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Ranunculus acaulis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
