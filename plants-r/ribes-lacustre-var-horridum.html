                    <h1>Ribes lacustre var. horridum</h1>
<p>Ribes lacustre var. horridum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed gooseberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark red or purple color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
