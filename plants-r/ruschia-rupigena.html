                    <h1>Ruschia rupigena</h1>
<p>Ruschia rupigena, commonly known as the rock fig or mountain fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
