                    <h1>Rhus carolinense</h1>
<p>Rhus carolinense, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into the winter. Its bark is thick and rough, with a distinctive, rugged texture that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Rhus carolinense is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
