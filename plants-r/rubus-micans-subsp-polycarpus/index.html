                            <h1>Rubus Micans Subsp. Polycarpus</h1>
<p>Rubus micans subsp. polycarpus is a lesser-known member of the raspberry family known for its unique botanical features. This subspecies is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. Found primarily in temperate regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its delicate appearance and edible fruits make it a subject of interest for botanists and foragers alike. Despite its modest size, this plant plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
