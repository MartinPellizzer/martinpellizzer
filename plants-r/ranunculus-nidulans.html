<p>Ranunculus nidulans, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with dark green, glossy leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread easily, making it both a common weed and an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
