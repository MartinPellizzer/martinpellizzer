                    <h1>Rhododendron villosulum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron villosulum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a shrub native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Rhododendron villosulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right growing conditions.</p>
