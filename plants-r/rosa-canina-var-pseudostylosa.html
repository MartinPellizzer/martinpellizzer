                    <h1>Rosa canina var. pseudostylosa</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. pseudostylosa, commonly known as the narrow-styled dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are pinnately compound, typically with five to seven leaflets, and the plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips in the fall. This variety is often found in woodland edges and scrub habitats, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from the more common Rosa canina, particularly in the structure of its floral parts.</p>
