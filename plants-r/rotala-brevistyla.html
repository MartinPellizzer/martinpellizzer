<p>Rotala brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
