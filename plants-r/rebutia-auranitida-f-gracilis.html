<p>Rebutia auranitida f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender golden rebutia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a similar white coating, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
