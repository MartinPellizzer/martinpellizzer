<p>Rumex hispanicus, commonly known as Spanish sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, reddish-green leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content.

It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in both ecological and historical contexts.</p>
