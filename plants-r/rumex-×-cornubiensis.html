                    <h1>Rumex × cornubiensis</h1>
<p>Rumex × cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornish sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broadleaf sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
