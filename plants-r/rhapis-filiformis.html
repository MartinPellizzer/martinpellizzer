<p>Rhapis filiformis, commonly known as the slender reed palm, is a compact, cold-hardy palm native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a slender, unbranched trunk that grows to about 3 to 5 feet tall, with a smooth, grayish-brown surface. The plant produces fan-shaped leaves that are dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. It is well-suited for container gardening and can thrive in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its elegant appearance and ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions.</p>
