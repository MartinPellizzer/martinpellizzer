<p>Rubus atricolor, commonly known as the blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically green with a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are usually dark purple to black in color when mature. These fruits are edible, though they are often used in jams and desserts due to their tart flavor.</p>
<p>Rubus atricolor thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
