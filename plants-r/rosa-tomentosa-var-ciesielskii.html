<p>Rosa tomentosa var. ciesielskii, commonly known as the Ciesielski's woolly rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white to pale pink flowers and a profuse covering of grayish-white hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its foliage is often described as woolly due to the thick layer of pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
