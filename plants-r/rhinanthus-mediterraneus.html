                    <h1>Rhinanthus mediterraneus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus mediterraneus, commonly known as the Mediterranean yellowtop, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils across southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in plant community dynamics and its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
