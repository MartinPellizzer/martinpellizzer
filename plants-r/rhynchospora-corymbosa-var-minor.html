<p>Rhynchospora corymbosa var. minor, commonly known as the small-corymbous bog sedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs, fens, and other moist environments. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to reddish in color.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils.</p>
