                    <h1>Remijia physophora</h1>
<p>Remijia physophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a distinctive, elongated shape that resembles a ghostly figure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
