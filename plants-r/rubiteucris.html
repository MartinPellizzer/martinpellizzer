                    <h1>Rubiteucris</h1>
<p>Rubiteucris, commonly known as the crimson flame orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vivid red and orange petals that resemble flames. The plant's botanical features include a slender, erect stem and specialized roots that help it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Rubiteucris is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
