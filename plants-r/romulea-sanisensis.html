<p>Romulea sanisensis, commonly known as the Sanisensian bulbous orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a bulbous stem and has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It flowers during the summer months and is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Romulea sanisensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
