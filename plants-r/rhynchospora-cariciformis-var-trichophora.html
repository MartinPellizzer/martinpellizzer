                    <h1>Rhynchospora cariciformis var. trichophora</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora cariciformis var. trichophora, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The hairy sedge plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
