                    <h1>Ricinocarpus cancanus</h1>
<p>Ricinocarpus cancanus, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to tropical coastal regions.</p>
<p>It has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, helping it survive in saline environments. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its roots form a dense network that stabilizes coastal sediments and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Ricinocarpus cancanus plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
