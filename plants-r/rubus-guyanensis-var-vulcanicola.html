<p>Rubus guyanensis var. vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, thorny stems and leaves with a coarse, serrated edge. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a slightly tart flavor. It thrives in high-altitude, volcanic soils, which contribute to its unique growth patterns and chemical composition.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range.</p>
