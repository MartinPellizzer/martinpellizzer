                    <h1>Rumex napalensis</h1>
<p>Rumex napalensis, commonly known as the Napali sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple underneath, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rumex napalensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
