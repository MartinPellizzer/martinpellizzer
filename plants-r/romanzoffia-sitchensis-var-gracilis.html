                    <h1>Romanzoffia sitchensis var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Romanzoffia sitchensis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, sandy soils along shores and tidal flats, where it thrives in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize shorelines.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems and its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions.</p>
