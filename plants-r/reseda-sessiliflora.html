<p>Reseda sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessileleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Reseda sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
