                    <h1>Rubus bifockeanus</h1>
<p>Rubus bifockeanus, commonly known as the bifoccal blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>
