                    <h1>Rubus × integribasioides</h1>
<p>Rubus × integribasioides, commonly known as the blackberry-boysenberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus ursi (boysenberry), resulting in a plant with distinctive dark purple to black berries. The plant features thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and produces fruit that is typically larger and more flavorful than its parent species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The berries are often used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications due to their rich flavor and high pectin content.</p>
