<p>Resnova lachenalioides, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
