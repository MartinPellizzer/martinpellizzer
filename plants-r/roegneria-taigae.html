<p>Roegneria taigae, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Roegneria taigae is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and tolerating low temperatures.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid or disturbed areas.</p>
