                    <h1>Rhizophora decandra</h1>
<p>Rhizophora decandra, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its extensive root system, which includes prop roots that provide structural support and aid in respiration in waterlogged soils. The plant has pneumatophores, specialized roots that protrude above the water to facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, white flowers and red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water, contributing to its role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
