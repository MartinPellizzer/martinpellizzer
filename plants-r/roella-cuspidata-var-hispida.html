                    <h1>Roella cuspidata var. hispida</h1>
<p>Roella cuspidata var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy roella, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions.</p>
