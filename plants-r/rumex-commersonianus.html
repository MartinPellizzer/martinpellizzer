                    <h1>Rumex commersonianus</h1>
<p>Rumex commersonianus, commonly known as narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are borne on erect, branched stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Rumex commersonianus is often found in moist environments such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
