The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in mountainous regions where other plants struggle to grow.</p>
