                    <h1>Rosa canina f. bregutiensis</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. bregutiensis, commonly known as the Bregutian dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose, characterized by its distinctive floral and foliar features.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces pale pink to white flowers with a subtle fragrance, and its leaves are typically smaller and more densely arranged than those of the typical Rosa canina. It is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 2â€“3 meters in height, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies.</p>
