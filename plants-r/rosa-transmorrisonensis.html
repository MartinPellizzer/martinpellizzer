                    <h1>Rosa transmorrisonensis</h1>
<p>Rosa transmorrisonensis, commonly known as the Morrison's rose, is a rare and striking species native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, velvety pink petals and a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa transmorrisonensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
