                    <h1>Rhynchanthera brachyrhyncha</h1>
<p>Rhynchanthera brachyrhyncha, commonly known as the short-horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with erect, hairy stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment, and the flowers are often clustered at the base of the stem.</p>
<p>This orchid is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its wetland habitat.</p>
