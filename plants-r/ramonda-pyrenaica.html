<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>Ramonda pyrenaica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open, sunny environments within its native range.</p>
