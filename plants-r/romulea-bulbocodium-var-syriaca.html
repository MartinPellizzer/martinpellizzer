The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
