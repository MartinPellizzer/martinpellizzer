<p>Rubus culminicola, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have serrated edges, while its stems are armed with stiff, curved prickles.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Rubus culminicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
