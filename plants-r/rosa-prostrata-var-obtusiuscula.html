<p>Rosa prostrata var. obtusiuscula, commonly known as the creeping shrub rose, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with rounded leaflets that are covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for ground cover in rocky or dry gardens due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature.</p>
