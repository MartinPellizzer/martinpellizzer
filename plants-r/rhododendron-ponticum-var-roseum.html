                    <h1>Rhododendron ponticum var. roseum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron ponticum var. roseum, commonly known as the pink-flowered rhododendron, is a variant of the evergreen shrub native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy, pink or rose-colored flowers. The plant produces large, clustered blooms that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
