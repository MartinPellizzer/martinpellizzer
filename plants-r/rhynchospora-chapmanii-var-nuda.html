                    <h1>Rhynchospora chapmanii var. nuda</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora chapmanii var. nuda, commonly known as Chapman's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. The plant produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by water or animals. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland health.</p>
