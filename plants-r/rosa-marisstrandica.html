                    <h1>Rosa marisstrandica</h1>
<p>Rosa marisstrandica, commonly known as the coastal rose, is a rare shrub native to the sandy shores of the Baltic Sea region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rosa marisstrandica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
