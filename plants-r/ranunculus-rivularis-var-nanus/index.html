                            <h1>Ranunculus Rivularis Var. Nanus</h1>
<p>Little water buttercup, scientifically known as Ranunculus rivularis var. nanus, is a delicate aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. This small species is often found along stream banks and in damp meadows, where it clings to moist soil or rocks. Its bright yellow flowers, resembling those of the common buttercup, are a striking feature that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Despite its beauty, the plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to touch or ingest. Due to habitat loss and pollution, this rare variant is increasingly threatened, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
