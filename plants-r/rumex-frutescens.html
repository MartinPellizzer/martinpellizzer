<p>Rumex frutescens, commonly known as red sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Rumex frutescens is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
