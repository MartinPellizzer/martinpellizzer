                    <h1>Rhododendron dilatatum f. lasiocarpum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron dilatatum f. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited alpine rhododendron, is a unique botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy texture on both its leaves and flower buds, which provides insulation against cold climates. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are usually pink to red, blooming in early spring, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in specialized botanical collections.</p>
