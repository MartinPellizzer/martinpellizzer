                    <h1>Rottboellia spathacea</h1>
<p>Rottboellia spathacea, commonly known as the false rice or swamp grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated with fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain areas.</p>
