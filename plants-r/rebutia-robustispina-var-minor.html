                    <h1>Rebutia robustispina var. minor</h1>
<p>Rebutia robustispina var. minor, commonly known as the miniature spiny euphorbia, is a compact, succulent perennial native to arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of pale green, fleshy stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
