<p>Rhinactinidia eremophila subsp.</p>
<p>tuvinica, commonly known as the Tuvinian sandwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The species produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the brief growing season. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
