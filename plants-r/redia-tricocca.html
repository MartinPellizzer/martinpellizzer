<p>Redia tricocca, commonly known as the three-lobed redia, is a lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique, three-lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to nutrient-poor soils and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
