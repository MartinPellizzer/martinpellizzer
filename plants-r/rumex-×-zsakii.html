<p>Rumex × zsakii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a reddish or purple tinge on the veins, and they have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular, winged seeds.</p>
