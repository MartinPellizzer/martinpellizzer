                    <h1>Rhus retinorrhoea</h1>
<p>Rhus retinorrhoea, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into numerous narrow, pointed leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is rough and furrowed, often resembling the texture of a stag's antlers, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Rhus retinorrhoea thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, disturbed soils, and along stream banks.</p>
