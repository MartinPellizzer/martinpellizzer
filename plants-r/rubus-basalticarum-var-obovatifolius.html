                    <h1>Rubus basalticarum var. obovatifolius</h1>
<p>Rubus basalticarum var. obovatifolius, commonly known as the basaltic blackberry, is a rare variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive obovate leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich volcanic soils, often found in regions with basaltic rock formations. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are prized for their intense flavor and medicinal properties. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a unique waxy coating that helps retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its adaptation to extreme geological conditions.</p>
