                    <h1>Rhus tumulicola f. meeuseana</h1>
<p>Rhus tumulicola f. meeuseana, commonly known as the Meeuse's sumac, is a rare and unique variant of the sumac genus.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries, a feature common in many sumac species. It thrives in specific ecological conditions, often found in moist, acidic soils in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and distinct morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
