<p>Rubus pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>austrotiroliensis, commonly known as the Austro-Tirolian brambles, is a shrub native to the Alps, particularly in Austria and northern Italy. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus.</p>
