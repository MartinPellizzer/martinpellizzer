                    <h1>Ranunculus densiciliatus var. nyingchiensis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus densiciliatus var. nyingchiensis, commonly known as the Nyingchi Ranunculus, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and a hairy stem, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
