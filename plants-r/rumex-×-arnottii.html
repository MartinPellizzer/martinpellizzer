                    <h1>Rumex × arnottii</h1>
<p>Rumex × arnottii, commonly known as the broadleaf dock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex obtusifolius and Rumex acetosa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on tall, erect stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its robust growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
