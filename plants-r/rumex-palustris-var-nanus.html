The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often obscured by the foliage. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental leaves, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
