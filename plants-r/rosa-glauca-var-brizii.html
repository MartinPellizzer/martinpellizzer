<p>Rosa glauca var. brizii, commonly known as the brizoid shrub rose, is a variant of the glaucous rose that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant is distinguished by its narrow, bristle-tipped leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
