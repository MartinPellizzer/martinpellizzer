                    <h1>Rumex × sagorskii</h1>
<p>Rumex × sagorskii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broadleaf sorrel), resulting in a plant with intermediate characteristics. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along the edges of woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes considered a weedy species in certain regions.</p>
