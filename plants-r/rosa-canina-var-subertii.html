                    <h1>Rosa canina var. subertii</h1>
<p>Rosa canina var. subertii, commonly known as the suberous dogwood rose, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the common rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, suberous (bark-like) stems and smaller, more compact growth habit compared to typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, followed by red-orange hips that are edible and rich in vitamin C. It is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally grown in specialized gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
