                    <h1>Rebutia caineana</h1>
<p>Rebutia caineana, commonly known as the Caine's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in desert plants to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rebutia caineana is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
