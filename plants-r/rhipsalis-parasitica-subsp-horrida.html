<p>Rhipsalis parasitica subsp.</p>
<p>horrida, commonly known as the spiny mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host plants, primarily in the genus *Bromeliaceae*. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis with its modified stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and unique morphology, it plays a specific role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
