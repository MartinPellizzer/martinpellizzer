<p>Ranunculus glacialis subsp.</p>
<p>camissonis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and arctic tundra, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with 5-15 sepals that are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
