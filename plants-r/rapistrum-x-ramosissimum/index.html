                            <h1>Rapistrum × Ramosissimum</h1>
<p>Rapeseed, scientifically known as Rapistrum × ramosissimum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is widely cultivated for its high oil content, which is used in cooking, biodiesel production, and industrial applications. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and robust growth, making it a common sight in agricultural fields. Despite its economic importance, rapeseed can also be a weed in certain environments if not properly managed. Its versatility and adaptability have made it a significant crop in many parts of the world.</p>
