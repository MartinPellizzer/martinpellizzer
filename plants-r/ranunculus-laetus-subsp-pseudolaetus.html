<p>Ranunculus laetus subsp.</p>
<p>pseudolaetus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical R. laetus. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant is often found at high altitudes, where it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
