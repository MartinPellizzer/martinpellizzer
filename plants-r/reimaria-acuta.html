                    <h1>Reimaria acuta</h1>
<p>Reimaria acuta, commonly known as the acute reindeer moss, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a pale to dark green or yellowish thallus. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments, typically found on tree bark or soil in temperate forests. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic relationship with algae for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Reimaria acuta is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
