<p>Rosa × aurosica, commonly known as the golden hybrid rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Rosa rugosa and Rosa × centifolia, resulting in a plant with robust growth and high disease resistance. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to full blooms in shades of pink, red, and yellow, typically in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, with thorny stems that provide structural support.</p>
<p>Rosa × aurosica is well-suited for coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
