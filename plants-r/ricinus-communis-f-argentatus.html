                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. argentatus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. argentatus, commonly known as the silverleaf castor, is a cultivar of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking silvery-white variegated leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broad, heart-shaped, and covered with a fine, silky coating that gives them their distinctive appearance. This ornamental plant is often grown for its aesthetic value rather than for its seeds, which are less abundant compared to the standard castor plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings.</p>
<p>The plant is not typically used for oil production but is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage.</p>
