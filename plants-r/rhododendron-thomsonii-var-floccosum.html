<p>Rhododendron thomsonii var. floccosum, commonly known as the Thomson's rhododendron var. floccosum, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers. The plant features broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native region.</p>
