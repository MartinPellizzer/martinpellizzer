<p>Rhamnus alpina var. grandifolia, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
