                    <h1>Raphia gracilis</h1>
<p>Raphia gracilis, commonly known as the slender palm, is a tall, fast-growing palm native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 6 meters in length. The plant produces large, yellowish flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, followed by clustered fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in wet, swampy areas and is often used for its fibrous trunk, which is harvested for thatching and handicrafts.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
