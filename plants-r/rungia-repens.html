                    <h1>Rungia repens</h1>
<p>Rungia repens, commonly known as the wandering begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, with hairy, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Rungia repens thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain environments.</p>
