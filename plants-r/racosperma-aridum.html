<p>Racosperma aridum, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Racosperma aridum is well adapted to low rainfall and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
