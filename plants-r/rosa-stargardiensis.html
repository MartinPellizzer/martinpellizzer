                    <h1>Rosa stargardiensis</h1>
<p>Rosa stargardiensis, commonly known as the Star-gard rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a star-like pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with cool summers and cold winters. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, edible hips similar to other rose species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa stargardiensis is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in conservation efforts.</p>
