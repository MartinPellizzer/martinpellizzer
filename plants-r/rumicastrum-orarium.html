<p>Rumicastrum orarium, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in a layer of white, powdery wax that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by green, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
