                    <h1>Rorippa palustris var. pacifica</h1>
<p>Rorippa palustris var. pacifica, commonly known as Pacific watercress, is a herbaceous annual plant native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, saline environments such as tidal marshes and brackish streams. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by water, allowing the plant to colonize new areas along shorelines.</p>
