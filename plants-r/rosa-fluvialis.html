                    <h1>Rosa fluvialis</h1>
<p>Rosa fluvialis, commonly known as the river rose, is a perennial shrub native to the wetlands and riverbanks of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along water edges. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, typically with a reddish hue when young.</p>
<p>Rosa fluvialis thrives in moist to wet soil and is often found in riparian zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
