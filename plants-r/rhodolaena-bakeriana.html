                    <h1>Rhodolaena bakeriana</h1>
<p>Rhodolaena bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's rhodolaena, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and densely arranged, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its cold, arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rhodolaena bakeriana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
