                    <h1>Rheedia arenicola</h1>
<p>Rheedia arenicola, commonly known as the coastal rheedia, is a flowering plant native to the sandy coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in well-drained, saline soils typical of beach environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Rheedia arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
