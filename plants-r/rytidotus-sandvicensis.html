                    <h1>Rytidotus sandvicensis</h1>
<p>Rytidotus sandvicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It relies on host trees such as the ohia (Erythrina sandwicensis) for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of Hawaii's forests.</p>
