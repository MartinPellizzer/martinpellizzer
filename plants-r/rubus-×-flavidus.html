<p>Rubus × flavidus, commonly known as the yellow bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many bramble species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and the plant is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Rubus × flavidus exhibits a range of morphological variations.</p>
