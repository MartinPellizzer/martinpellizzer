                    <h1>Ricinocarpus phleoides</h1>
<p>Ricinocarpus phleoides, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing shade and habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Its rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Due to its size and growth habits, it plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems but can also become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
