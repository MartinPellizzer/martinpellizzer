<p>Rubus rariflorus, commonly known as the rareflower raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are less commonly consumed than other raspberry varieties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
