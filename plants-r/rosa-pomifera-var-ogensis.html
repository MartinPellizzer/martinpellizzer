                    <h1>Rosa pomifera var. ogensis</h1>
<p>Rosa pomifera var. ogensis, commonly known as the Ogasawara rose, is a rare and unique species native to the Ogasawara Islands in Japan.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its large, fleshy fruits that resemble a pineapple, hence its common name. The leaves are simple and alternate, with a serrated margin, and the plant produces clusters of fragrant white flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
