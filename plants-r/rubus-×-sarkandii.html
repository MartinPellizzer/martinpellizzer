                    <h1>Rubus × sarkandii</h1>
<p>Rubus × sarkandii, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (common raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and the production of small, tart berries that are typically red or orange in color. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations and is of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies.</p>
