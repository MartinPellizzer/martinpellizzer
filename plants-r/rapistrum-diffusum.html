<p>Rapistrum diffusum, commonly known as common knotgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and linear leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in moist environments. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Rapistrum diffusum is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
