                    <h1>Rosa mollis var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Rosa mollis var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are typically prostrate or ascending, often forming a carpet-like cover on the ground.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
