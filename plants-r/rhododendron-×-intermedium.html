                    <h1>Rhododendron × intermedium</h1>
<p>Rhododendron × intermedium, commonly known as the cross-leaved rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a reddish tinge. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates.</p>
