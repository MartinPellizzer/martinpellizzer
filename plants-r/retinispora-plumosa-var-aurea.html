<p>Retinispora plumosa var. aurea, commonly known as the golden feather fern, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'aurea' distinguishes it by its vibrant golden-yellow coloration, which contrasts beautifully with its lush green foliage. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining, acidic soil. Its foliage is composed of finely divided, arching fronds that create a cascading effect, making it ideal for hanging baskets or as a decorative indoor plant.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively low-maintenance, requiring regular watering and indirect sunlight to flourish.</p>
