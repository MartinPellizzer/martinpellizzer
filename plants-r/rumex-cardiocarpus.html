                    <h1>Rumex cardiocarpus</h1>
<p>Rumex cardiocarpus, commonly known as heart-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are edible but can be quite tart due to their high oxalic acid content.</p>
