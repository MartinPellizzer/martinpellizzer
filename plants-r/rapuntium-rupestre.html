                    <h1>Rapuntium rupestre</h1>
<p>Rapuntium rupestre, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in crevices and on exposed rock surfaces, demonstrating a high tolerance for poor soil conditions and extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Rapuntium rupestre is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
