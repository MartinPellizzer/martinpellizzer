<p>Rimaria pole-evansii, commonly known as the Evans' rimaria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like structure. The plant is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and small, daisy-like blooms that typically appear in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rimaria pole-evansii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
