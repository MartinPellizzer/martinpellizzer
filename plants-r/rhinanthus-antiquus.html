                    <h1>Rhinanthus antiquus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus antiquus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in grasslands and meadows, where it helps to reduce the dominance of grasses by parasitizing them.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus antiquus plays an important role in promoting biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
