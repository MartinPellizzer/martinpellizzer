<p>Rapanea koebrensis, commonly known as the Malagasy lauraceae, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.
