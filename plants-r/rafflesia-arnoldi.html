                    <h1>Rafflesia arnoldi</h1>
<p>Rafflesia arnoldi, commonly known as the corpse flower, is a parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing the largest individual flowers in the world, which can reach diameters of up to three feet. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts carrion flies for pollination.</p>
<p>Despite its dramatic appearance, Rafflesia arnoldi is rare and faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
