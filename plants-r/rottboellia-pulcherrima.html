                    <h1>Rottboellia pulcherrima</h1>
<p>Rottboellia pulcherrima, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires careful management due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
