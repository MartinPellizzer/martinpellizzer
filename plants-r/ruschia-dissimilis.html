<p>Ruschia dissimilis, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments.

It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Ruschia dissimilis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
