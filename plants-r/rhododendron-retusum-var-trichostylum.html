<p>Rhododendron retusum var. trichostylum, commonly known as the woolly alpine rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive woolly coating on both the leaves and stems, which helps it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climatic conditions.</p>
