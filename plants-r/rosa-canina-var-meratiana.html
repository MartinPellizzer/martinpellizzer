<p>Rosa canina var. meratiana, commonly known as the Meratian dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
