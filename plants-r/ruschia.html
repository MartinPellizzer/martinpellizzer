                    <h1>Ruschia</h1>
<p>Ruschia, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "sun rose," is a genus of flowering plants in the Aizoaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. Ruschia species typically have a low-growing, mat-forming habit, making them ideal for rock gardens and dry landscapes. They are drought-tolerant and thrive in full sun, with some species blooming in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>The flowers often appear in clusters and are followed by small, bead-like fruits.</p>
