                    <h1>Ranunculus luzulifolius</h1>
<p>Ranunculus luzulifolius, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive.</p>
