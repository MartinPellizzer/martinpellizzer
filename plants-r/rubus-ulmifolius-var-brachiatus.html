                    <h1>Rubus ulmifolius var. brachiatus</h1>
<p>Rubus ulmifolius var. brachiatus, commonly known as the bracted blackberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bracts that are often more prominent than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, dark red to black fruits that are typically edible, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and horticultural interest.</p>
