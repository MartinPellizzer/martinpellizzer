<p>Rhipsalis dissimilis, commonly known as the silver needle cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, thin, and often branched stems that resemble green tendrils. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it does not have true leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis dissimilis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
