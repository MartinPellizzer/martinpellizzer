                    <h1>Rumex paludosus</h1>
<p>Rumex paludosus, commonly known as swamp sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish midrib and serrated edges. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Rumex paludosus is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
