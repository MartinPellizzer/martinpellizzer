                    <h1>Rafflesia meijeri</h1>
<p>Rafflesia meijeri, commonly known as the Meijer's corpse flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is renowned for its enormous, fleshy, and strongly odorous flowers, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant is a parasitic species, lacking true roots, stems, or leaves, and relies entirely on a host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a putrid smell to attract carrion flies, which serve as its primary pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia meijeri is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
