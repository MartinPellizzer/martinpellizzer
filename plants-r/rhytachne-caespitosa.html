                    <h1>Rhytachne caespitosa</h1>
<p>Rhytachne caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, grass-like clumps with slender, erect stems that are often covered in small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or brown, and it has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Rhytachne caespitosa plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for the health of wetland habitats.</p>
