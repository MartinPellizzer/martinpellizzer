                            <h1>Rubus Longior</h1>
<p>Rubus longior is a lesser-known member of the raspberry family known for its unique appearance and ecological significance. This shrub is native to parts of Asia and is often found in forested areas with moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges that help distinguish it from other similar species. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often overlooked due to their modest size. Despite its subtle presence, Rubus longior plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
