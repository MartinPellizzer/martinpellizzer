                    <h1>Ruellia bolivarensis</h1>
<p>Ruellia bolivarensis, commonly known as Bolivian ruellia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet tubular flowers, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Ruellia bolivarensis is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, including forest understories and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively uncommon in garden landscapes.</p>
