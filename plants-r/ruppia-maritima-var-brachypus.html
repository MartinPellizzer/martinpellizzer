<p>It is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and flowers that bloom in clusters. This variety is typically found in coastal wetlands and brackish waters, where it thrives in shallow, tidal zones. The plant plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
