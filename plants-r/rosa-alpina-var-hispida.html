The leaves are alternate, simple, and covered with fine, glandular hairs that give them a slightly sticky texture. Its stems are woody and often bear thorns, which are typical of many rose species.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
