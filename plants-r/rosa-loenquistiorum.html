<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often with a subtle red hue at the base. The plant produces narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rosa loenquistiorum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
