                    <h1>Rubus radula var. papulosus</h1>
<p>Rubus radula var. papulosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red or black color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of interest for horticultural study.</p>
