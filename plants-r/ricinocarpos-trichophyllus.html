                    <h1>Ricinocarpos trichophyllus</h1>
<p>Ricinocarpos trichophyllus, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling habit with fleshy, hairy stems that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ricinocarpos trichophyllus is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments.</p>
