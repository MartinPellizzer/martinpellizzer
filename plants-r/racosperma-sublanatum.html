                    <h1>Racosperma sublanatum</h1>
<p>Racosperma sublanatum, commonly known as the velvet acacia, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a velvety appearance, particularly on the stems and leaves. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets, and are often covered in a fine, silky texture. It produces yellow or orange flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits.</p>
<p>This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
