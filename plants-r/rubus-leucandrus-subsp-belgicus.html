<p>Rubus leucandrus subsp.</p>
<p>belgicus, commonly known as the Belgian white-bracted raspberry, is a shrub native to parts of Europe, particularly Belgium and the Netherlands. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, red, edible berries similar to other raspberries, though they are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hedgerows.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique bracts and floral morphology, which set it apart from other Rubus species.</p>
