                    <h1>Ranunculus × calcareus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus × calcareus, commonly known as the limestone buttercup, is a hybrid plant species that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Ranunculus ficaria and Ranunculus bulbosus.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, and it produces small, round, greenish-brown seeds in a fluffy cluster. Ranunculus × calcareus is known for its adaptability to marginal habitats and its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for calcareous soils and its ecological importance in supporting pollinators.</p>
