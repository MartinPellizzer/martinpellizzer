                    <h1>Ribeirea elliptica</h1>
<p>Ribeirea elliptica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
