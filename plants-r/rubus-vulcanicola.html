                    <h1>Rubus vulcanicola</h1>
<p>Rubus vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic blackberry, is a unique species adapted to extreme volcanic environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, ash-rich soils found in areas with recent volcanic activity. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its dark purple berries are small but contain high levels of antioxidants.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in volcanic ecosystems.</p>
