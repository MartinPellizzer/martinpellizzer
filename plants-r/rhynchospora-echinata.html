                    <h1>Rhynchospora echinata</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora echinata, commonly known as the spiny flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Rhynchospora echinata is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>
