                    <h1>Ranunculus natans f. microphyllus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus natans f. microphyllus, commonly known as the lesser water buttercup, is a aquatic plant characterized by its small, delicate leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. The plant's leaves are floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Its flowers are usually borne on short stems and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical Ranunculus natans.</p>
