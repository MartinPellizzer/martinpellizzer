                    <h1>Rouxopteris boryi var. madagascariensis</h1>
<p>Rouxopteris boryi var. madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming compact clumps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
