<p>Rhysolepis ellenbergii, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure with a leathery texture and a pale to dark green color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in low-nutrient conditions make it an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
