                    <h1>Rauia resinosa</h1>
<p>Rauia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous rauia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>The resinous sap is the primary feature that distinguishes it from other similar species in the Rauia genus.</p>
