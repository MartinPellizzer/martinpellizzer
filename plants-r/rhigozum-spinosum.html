                    <h1>Rhigozum spinosum</h1>
<p>Rhigozum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny greenbriar, is a woody shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Its prickly nature makes it both a defensive mechanism and a challenge for human interaction.</p>
