                    <h1>Ribes laxiflorum var. inermis</h1>
<p>Ribes laxiflorum var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth-flowered gooseberry, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in late summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, and the plant is often found in moist, woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The variety inermis is distinguished by the absence of thorns on its stems, making it less prickly than other Ribes species.</p>
