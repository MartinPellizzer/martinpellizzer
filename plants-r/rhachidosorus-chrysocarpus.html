                    <h1>Rhachidosorus chrysocarpus</h1>
<p>Rhachidosorus chrysocarpus, commonly known as the golden fruit cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces distinctive, elongated cones, with the male cones typically appearing at the base of the trunk and the female cones emerging from the upper part. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its bright yellow fruits, which are edible when ripe.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and research purposes.</p>
