                    <h1>Rhodocodon calcicola var. linearifolius</h1>
<p>Rhodocodon calcicola var. linearifolius, commonly known as the linear-leaved rock rose, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is typically found in limestone-rich soils and is endemic to specific regions in southern Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
