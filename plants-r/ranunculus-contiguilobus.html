                    <h1>Ranunculus contiguilobus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus contiguilobus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. Its roots are fibrous and can spread to form dense mats, which helps it colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Ranunculus contiguilobus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
