                            <h1>Rubus Pallidus Subsp. Chlorocaulon</h1>
<p>Pale raspberry, scientifically known as Rubus pallidus subsp. chlorocaulon, is a unique member of the Rubus genus that thrives in specific alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale pink flowers and hairy stems, which set it apart from other raspberry varieties. Found primarily in regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it grows in rocky and moist environments where few plants can survive. Despite its modest appearance, the pale raspberry plays an important ecological role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability. Its limited distribution and delicate nature make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
