                    <h1>Rhodiola bhutanica</h1>
<p>Rhodiola bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan rose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of Bhutan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine conditions. It is well adapted to cold climates and has a shallow root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Rhodiola bhutanica is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses.</p>
