                    <h1>Rheum macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Rheum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant rhubarb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, waxy, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a deep green color and a hairy texture. The plant produces tall, reddish stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible, though they are typically too fibrous and tart for culinary use.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage.</p>
