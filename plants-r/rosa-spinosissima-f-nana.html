                    <h1>Rosa spinosissima f. nana</h1>
<p>Rosa spinosissima f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf spinose rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub that exhibits the characteristic thorny stems of its parent species.</p>
<p>This cultivar is prized for its dense, rounded growth habit and its ability to form a thick, matted ground cover. The foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with small, leathery leaves that are arranged in an alternate pattern. It produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover in well-drained soils.</p>
