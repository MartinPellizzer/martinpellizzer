                    <h1>Rumicastrum chamaecladum</h1>
<p>Rumicastrum chamaecladum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
