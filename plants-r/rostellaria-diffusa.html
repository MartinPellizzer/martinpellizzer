                    <h1>Rostellaria diffusa</h1>
<p>Rostellaria diffusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a unique, elongated lip that resembles a ghostly face, contributing to its ethereal appearance. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Rostellaria diffusa is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
