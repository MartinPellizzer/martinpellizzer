<p>Rubus chloroticus, commonly known as the yellow blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellowish fruits, which are smaller and less common than those of other Rubus species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and it produces small white flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
