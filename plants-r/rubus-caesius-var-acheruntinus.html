                    <h1>Rubus caesius var. acheruntinus</h1>
<p>Rubus caesius var. acheruntinus, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to nearly black berries, which are often larger and more intensely flavored than those of the typical Rubus caesius. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses.</p>
