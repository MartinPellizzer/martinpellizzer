                    <h1>Rumex × leptophyllus</h1>
<p>Rumex × leptophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa and Rumex obtusifolius.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches wide. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are usually borne on tall, erect stalks. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on environmental conditions.</p>
