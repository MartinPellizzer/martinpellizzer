                    <h1>Rosa viscaria var. rothomagensis</h1>
<p>Rosa viscaria var. rothomagensis, commonly known as the Rothomagens rose, is a rare and highly ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Romania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its foliage consists of dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adding to its visual appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
