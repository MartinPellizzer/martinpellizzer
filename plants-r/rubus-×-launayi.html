                    <h1>Rubus × launayi</h1>
<p>Rubus × launayi, commonly known as the Launay blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus gebleri (blackberry).</p>
<p>It is a thorny shrub that typically grows in temperate climates, featuring dark green leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in horticulture and botany.</p>
