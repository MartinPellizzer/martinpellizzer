                    <h1>Rhizophora racemosa</h1>
<p>Rhizophora racemosa, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prop roots, which provide structural support in soft, waterlogged soils and aid in gas exchange. The plant thrives in brackish water environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces woody fruits that contain buoyant seeds for dispersal.</p>
<p>Rhizophora racemosa is an important component of mangrove ecosystems, supporting a diverse array of marine and terrestrial life.</p>
