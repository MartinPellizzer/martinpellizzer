<p>Rosa × fruticulosa, commonly known as the shrub rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa chinensis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and dense, thorny stems that form a compact shrub. The plant produces abundant clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and oval-shaped, providing a lush backdrop to the blooms.</p>
<p>Rosa × fruticulosa is well-suited for coastal areas due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
