<p>Rubus arcticus subsp.</p>
<p>stellarcticus, commonly known as the starfruit bramble, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces edible, tart berries that are adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its frost-resistant nature and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
