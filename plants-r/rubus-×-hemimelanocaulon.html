                    <h1>Rubus × hemimelanocaulon</h1>
<p>Rubus × hemimelanocaulon, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus istricus (loganberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parent species. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parents. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its thorny stems and compound leaves are typical of the Rubus genus, making it both distinctive and ecologically significant.</p>
