                    <h1>Rhetinocarpha suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Rhetinocarpha suffruticosa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, spiny leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Rhetinocarpha suffruticosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
