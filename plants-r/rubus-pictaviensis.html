                    <h1>Rubus pictaviensis</h1>
<p>Rubus pictaviensis, commonly known as the Picardy raspberry, is a shrub native to the regions of western Europe, particularly France and parts of the British Isles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its native habitat.</p>
