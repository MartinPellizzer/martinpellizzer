                    <h1>Rumex × grintzescui</h1>
<p>Rumex × grintzescui, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broadleaf sorrel).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that have a distinctive reddish coloration on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on erect, branching inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its hybrid nature results in a unique combination of traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
