                    <h1>Radiogrammitis peninsularis</h1>
<p>Radiogrammitis peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Rock Fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid microhabitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive, linear pattern.</p>
<p>Radiogrammitis peninsularis is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
