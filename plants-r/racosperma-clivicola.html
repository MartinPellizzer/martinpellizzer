                    <h1>Racosperma clivicola</h1>
<p>Racosperma clivicola, commonly known as the cliff rock fig, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and cliff faces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Racosperma clivicola is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
