                    <h1>Ranunculus colonorum</h1>
<p>Ranunculus colonorum, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or meadow habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a short, stout stem with palmately divided, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Ranunculus colonorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators in its native ecosystems.</p>
