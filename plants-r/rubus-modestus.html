<p>Rubus modestus, commonly known as the modest raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, edible berries that ripen in the summer. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>The berries are often used in jams and desserts, though they are less commonly cultivated than other raspberry varieties.</p>
