                    <h1>Rhinanthus bosnensis var. siculorum</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus bosnensis var. siculorum, commonly known as the Bosnian tickseed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and is typically found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
