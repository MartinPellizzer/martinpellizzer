<p>Rhinanthus trixago, commonly known as the common tickseed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are clustered in dense spikes.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus trixago plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in areas with a diverse plant community.</p>
