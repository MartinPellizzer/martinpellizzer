                    <h1>Rubus × deductivus</h1>
<p>Rubus × deductivus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark red to black berries that are typically larger than those of pure species. The plant is a deciduous shrub with arching canes and compound leaves, often found in temperate regions. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal fruit production.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is generally not found in the wild and is cultivated for its unique flavor and ornamental value.</p>
