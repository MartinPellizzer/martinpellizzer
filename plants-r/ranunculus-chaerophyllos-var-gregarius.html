<p>Ranunculus chaerophyllos var. gregarius, commonly known as the clustered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous small petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as meadows and forest edges. It has a short stem and produces seeds in a follicle that splits open when mature.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its clustered growth habit, which sets it apart from other ranunculus species.</p>
