The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections.</p>
