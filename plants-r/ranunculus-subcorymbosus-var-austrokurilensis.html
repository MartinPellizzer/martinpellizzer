<p>Ranunculus subcorymbosus var. austrokurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the islands of the Kuril archipelago.</p>
<p>It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky coastal areas. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
