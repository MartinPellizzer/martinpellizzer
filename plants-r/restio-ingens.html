                    <h1>Restio ingens</h1>
<p>Restio ingens, commonly known as the giant restio, is a tall, grass-like plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing in coastal dunes or fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its height and structure, it is sometimes mistaken for a grass or reed, but it has distinct botanical features that set it apart.</p>
