                    <h1>Ranunculus paludosus var. flabellatus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus paludosus var. flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moist conditions, it is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along the edges of streams.</p>
