                    <h1>Rosa pimpinellifolia subvar. liostyla</h1>
<p>Rosa pimpinellifolia subvar. liostyla, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with finely divided leaflets that are covered in a soft, silvery down. This subspecies is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring flowering and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
