                    <h1>Rhinanthus aschersonianus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus aschersonianus, commonly known as the common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis itself. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and short lifespan make it an important early successional species in many ecosystems.</p>
