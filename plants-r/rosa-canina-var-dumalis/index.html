                            <h1>Rosa Canina Var. Dumalis</h1>
<p>Dog rose, scientifically known as Rosa canina var. dumalis, is a hardy shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant pink flowers and thorny stems, which make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable. This variety of the dog rose is often found in woodland edges and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its berries, though tart, are used in traditional herbal remedies and as a source of nourishment for wildlife. The plant holds cultural significance in folklore and is valued for its resilience and beauty.</p>
