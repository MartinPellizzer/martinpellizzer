<p>Rhigospira quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-angle cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, ridged stems that form a compact, spiky structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Rhigospira quadrangularis is well adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and intriguing species for botanical study.</p>
