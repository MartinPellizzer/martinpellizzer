<p>Rubus subgothicus, commonly known as the Arctic bramble, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark red berries and prickly stems, which are adaptations to its harsh, cold environment. The plant typically grows in rocky, open habitats and is well-suited to low temperatures and short growing seasons. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>Rubus subgothicus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its fragile habitat.</p>
