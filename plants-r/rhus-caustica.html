                <h1>Rhus caustica</h1>
<p>Rhus caustica, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that resembles the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into the winter. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall.</p>
<p>Rhus caustica is often found in dry, open woods and along roadsides, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
