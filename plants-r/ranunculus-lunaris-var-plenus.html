                    <h1>Ranunculus lunaris var. plenus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus lunaris var. plenus, commonly known as the full-flowered water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and stream sides in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating or submerged leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic environments. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a response to light known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its plump, full blooms, which distinguish it from other ranunculus species.</p>
