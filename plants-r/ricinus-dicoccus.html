                    <h1>Ricinus dicoccus</h1>
<p>Ricinus dicoccus, commonly known as the two-seed kapok tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces long, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its fibrous seed pods, which contain seeds surrounded by a cotton-like substance. The seeds are often used in traditional medicine, while the fibers are used for making textiles.</p>
<p>However, the plant is not as widely cultivated as other ricin-producing species due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
