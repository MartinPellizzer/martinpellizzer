                    <h1>Rubus spinetorum</h1>
<p>Rubus spinetorum, commonly known as the spiny blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark red or black color, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly growth habit, it can be challenging to manage in agricultural or garden settings.</p>
