<p>Ranunculus sceleratus var. submersus, commonly known as the submerged crowfoot, is a rare aquatic variant of the crowfoot genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into narrow, thread-like segments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in certain regions.</p>
