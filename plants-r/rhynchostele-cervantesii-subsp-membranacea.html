<p>Rhynchostele cervantesii subsp.</p>
<p>membranacea, commonly known as the Mexican spiny scale tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related hardwoods.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its distinctive spiny leaves and a woody stem with a complex, hollow central vascular structure known as a rhynchostele. Its leaves are typically small,革质 (leathery), and have a dense arrangement, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
