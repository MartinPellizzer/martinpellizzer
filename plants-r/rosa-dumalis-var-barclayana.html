<p>Rosa dumalis var. barclayana, commonly known as the Barclay's rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features arching, thorned stems with dense, dark green foliage that provides a lush backdrop for its showy, single or semi-double pink to red flowers. The plant produces oval, yellowish-tinged fruits known as rose hips, which are typically harvested in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
