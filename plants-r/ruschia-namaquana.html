<p>Ruschia namaquana, commonly known as the Namib Desert star, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a vibrant touch to its desert environment. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Ruschia namaquana thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
