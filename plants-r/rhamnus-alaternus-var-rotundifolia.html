                    <h1>Rhamnus alaternus var. rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Rhamnus alaternus var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often rounded at the tips. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by reddish-black berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its potential invasiveness.</p>
