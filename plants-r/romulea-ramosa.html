<p>Romulea ramosa, commonly known as the clustered glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, nodding yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Romulea ramosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
