<p>Rorippa × prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate watercress, is a hybrid species belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, alternate leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in water bodies.</p>
