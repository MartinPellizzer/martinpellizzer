                    <h1>Retispatha</h1>
<p>Retispatha, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions in Australia and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structures that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plants typically have tall, slender stems with clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring or summer. Retispatha species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their specialized adaptations and role in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
