                    <h1>Rhagadiolus creticus</h1>
<p>Rhagadiolus creticus, commonly known as the Cretan rhagadion, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Crete.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically during the spring season. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in rocky or limestone soils. It is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhagadiolus creticus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
