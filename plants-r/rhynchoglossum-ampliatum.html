<p>Rhynchoglossum ampliatum, commonly known as the broadleaf rhynchoglossum, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
