<p>Rhizophora longissima, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive aerial roots, which help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils and facilitate gas exchange. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries containing seeds.</p>
<p>Rhizophora longissima plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
