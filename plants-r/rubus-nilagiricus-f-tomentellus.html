<p>Rubus nilagiricus f. tomentellus, commonly known as the Nilagiri raspberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to the Nilgiri Mountains in southern India.</p>

The plant produces small, red, aggregate fruits that are typically consumed fresh or used in local culinary practices. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
