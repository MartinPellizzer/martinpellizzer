                    <h1>Rhabdocrinum serotinum</h1>
<p>Rhabdocrinum serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering rhabdocrinum, is a rare and elusive plant species native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs later in the growing season, often in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>
