                    <h1>Reynoutria × mizushimae</h1>
<p>Reynoutria × mizushimae, commonly known as the hybrid giant knotweed, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Reynoutria japonica* (Japanese knotweed) and *Reynoutria sieboldii* (Siberian knotweed).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust growth, large heart-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, pale pink flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is notable for its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, making it highly invasive in many regions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological impact, it is considered a noxious weed in several countries.</p>
