<p>Rhinanthus major subsp.</p>
<p>apterus, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in grassland habitats. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its role in promoting biodiversity by reducing competitive pressure on grasses.</p>
