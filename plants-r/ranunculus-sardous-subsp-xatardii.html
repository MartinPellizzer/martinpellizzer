<p>Ranunculus sardous subsp.</p>
<p>xatardii, commonly known as the Xatard alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where conditions are cool and moist.</p>
<p>The plant features showy yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often surrounded by a ring of white or pale sepals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in photosynthesis in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine setting.</p>
