                            <h1>Relbunium Hypocarpium Var. Relbun</h1>
<p>Common centaury, scientifically known as Relbunium hypocarpium var. relbun, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies. However, its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a species of conservation concern.</p>
