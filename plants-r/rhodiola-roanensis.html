                <h1>Rhodiola roanensis</h1>
<p>Rhodiola roanensis, commonly known as the Roan rosebay, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the European Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and nutrients in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Rhodiola roanensis is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses.</p>
