<p>Rosa rhaetica var. homoeacantha, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep red to purple flowers and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant, five-petaled blooms. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
