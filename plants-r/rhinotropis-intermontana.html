                    <h1>Rhinotropis intermontana</h1>
<p>Rhinotropis intermontana, commonly known as the mountain rhinoceros plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
