<p>Rumex tuberosus subsp.</p>
<p>horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The leaves and roots are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation.</p>
