<p>Rodentiophila, commonly known as the mouse-ear plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that resemble the ears of mice, hence its common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, a feature typical of the carrot family. Rodentiophila species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>These plants are generally herbaceous, with some species growing as annuals or perennials depending on the species and climate.</p>
