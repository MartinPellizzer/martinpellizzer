<p>Ruschia prostrata, commonly known as the carpet flower, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form and ornamental flowers, it is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover.</p>
