<p>Rhizanthes deceptor, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is notable for its deceptive appearance, resembling a decaying animal to attract unsuspecting prey. The plant lacks traditional leaves and stems, instead relying on its specialized, meaty structures to trap insects. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat and appearance, it is a rare and elusive species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
