<p>Rosa tomentella subsp.</p>
<p>sclerophylla, commonly known as the woolly shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
