<p>Rubus peltaefolius var. hypopsilos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with a narrow, leathery texture and a distinctive leaf shape that is peltate, meaning the base of the leaf is broad and rounded. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, which are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves.</p>
