                <h1>Restio calcicola</h1>
<p>Restio calcicola, commonly known as the limestone restio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. This species is typically found growing in rocky, well-drained soils, often in areas with high sunlight exposure. Its slender, grass-like stems are often mistaken for grasses, but it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny white or pale blue flowers.</p>
<p>Restio calcicola is well-suited to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
