<p>Rubus villicaulis aquaticus, commonly known as the water raspberry, is a species of brambles native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible red berries in the summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
