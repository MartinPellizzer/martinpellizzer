                    <h1>Razumovia brunoniana</h1>
<p>Razumovia brunoniana, commonly known as the Brunoniana razumovia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the short growing season in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Razumovia brunoniana is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
