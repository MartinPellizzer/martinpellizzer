                    <h1>Rhizophora rheedei</h1>
<p>Rhizophora rheedei, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to tropical regions of the Indian Ocean and western Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that extend above the water to facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in saline environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines.</p>
<p>The tree has a distinctive red bark and is often found in estuaries and mangrove forests.</p>
