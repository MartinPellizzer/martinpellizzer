                    <h1>Rosa pomifera subvar. hausmannii</h1>
<p>Rosa pomifera subvar. hausmannii, commonly known as the Hausmann's rose, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy, edible fruits that resemble a cross between a rosehip and a fig, often referred to as "rose apples.". The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in early summer, followed by the development of its distinctive fruiting bodies. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species.</p>
