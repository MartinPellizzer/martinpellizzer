                    <h1>Ricinus megalosperma</h1>
<p>Ricinus megalosperma, commonly known as the giant castor bean, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and striking, spiny seed pods that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces toxic seeds containing ricin, one of the most poisonous substances known to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant rather than for agricultural use.</p>
