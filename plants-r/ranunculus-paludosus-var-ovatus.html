<p>Ranunculus paludosus var. ovatus, commonly known as the broadleaf water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in shallow, still water and is adapted to nutrient-rich, muddy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its aquatic nature, it plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
