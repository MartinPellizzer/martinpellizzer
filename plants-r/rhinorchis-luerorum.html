<p>Rhinorchis luerorum, commonly known as the Luer's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rhinorchis luerorum is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
