<p>Rhipidocladum arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant adapted to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Rhipidocladum arenicola is native to regions along the Atlantic coast, including parts of the United States and Europe.</p>
