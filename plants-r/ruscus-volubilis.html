                    <h1>Ruscus volubilis</h1>
<p>Ruscus volubilis, commonly known as creeping spurge, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form dense mats over time.</p>
