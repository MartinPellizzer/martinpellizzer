                    <h1>Rubus divexiramus var. horridulus</h1>
<p>Rubus divexiramus var. horridulus, commonly known as the rough-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its foliage is often described as having a distinctive, bristly texture due to the presence of fine, stiff hairs.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties.</p>
