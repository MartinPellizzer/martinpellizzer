                    <h1>Rhodormis</h1>
<p>Rhodormis, commonly known as the red moss, is a type of aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth and vibrant red or pink coloration, which is due to the presence of pigments like phycobilins. Rhodormis is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and damp soil, where it plays a role in stabilizing the substrate and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>It is an important indicator species for water quality and ecosystem health.</p>
