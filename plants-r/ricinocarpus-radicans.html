<p>Ricinocarpus radicans, commonly known as the climbing ricin tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stem and climbing habit, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin, it is considered dangerous and should be handled with care.</p>
