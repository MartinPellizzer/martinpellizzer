<p>Roraimaea, commonly known as the Roraima fern, is a unique plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Pteris and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Roraimaea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
