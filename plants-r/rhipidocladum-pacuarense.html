                    <h1>Rhipidocladum pacuarense</h1>
<p>Rhipidocladum pacuarense, commonly known as the Pacuare cliff fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Rhipidocladum pacuarense is considered a conservation concern.</p>
