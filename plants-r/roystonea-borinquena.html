<p>Roystonea borinquena, commonly known as the Boriqu√©n palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm with a straight trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, elongated fruits containing hard, dark seeds. It thrives in coastal and dry forest habitats, often growing in sandy or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
