                    <h1>Rhus fastigiata</h1>
<p>Rhus fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Rhus fastigiata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
