<p>Rhysolepis goyasensis, commonly known as the Goyasense lichen, is a rare and unique organism that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a complex symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi, which is essential for its survival and nutrient acquisition. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role and potential medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
