<p>Rubus procerus f. degeneratus, commonly known as the degenerate blackberry.</p>
<p>It is a subspecies of the blackberry plant characterized by its smaller, less robust growth compared to the typical Rubus procerus. The plant produces small, dark berries that are often less flavorful and more acidic than those of its parent species. It thrives in temperate climates and is typically found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and genetic research.</p>
