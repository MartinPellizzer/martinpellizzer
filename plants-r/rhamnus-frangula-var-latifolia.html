                    <h1>Rhamnus frangula var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Rhamnus frangula var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Rhamnus frangula. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
