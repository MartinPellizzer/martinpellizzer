                    <h1>Rhytiglossa glandulifera</h1>
<p>Rhytiglossa glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular lip fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are covered in small, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky surfaces or tree trunks.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
