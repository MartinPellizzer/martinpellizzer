<p>Restrepia ephippium, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests. The plant features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers with a faint fragrance. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
