                <h1>Rhododendron alutaceum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron alutaceum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Rhododendron alutaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in alpine ecosystems.</p>
