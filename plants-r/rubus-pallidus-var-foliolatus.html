<p>Rubus pallidus var. foliolatus, commonly known as the pale bramble or leafy raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by edible, tart berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>
