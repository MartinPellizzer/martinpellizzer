<p>Rapistrum rugosum subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpum, commonly known as the rough sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has hairy, sometimes glandular leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
