                    <h1>Rotala ramosior</h1>
<p>Rotala ramosior, commonly known as the water thyme, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, which helps reduce water resistance as it floats or is submerged.</p>
<p>Rotala ramosior is often used in aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
