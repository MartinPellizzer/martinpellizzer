                    <h1>Rorippa aspera var. laevigata</h1>
<p>Rorippa aspera var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth watercress, is a flowering plant species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, alternate, ovate leaves that are smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from other varieties of Rorippa. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom above the water surface in early summer. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it a common aquatic weed in freshwater habitats.</p>
