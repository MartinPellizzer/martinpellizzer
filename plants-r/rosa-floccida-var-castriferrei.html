                    <h1>Rosa floccida var. castriferrei</h1>
<p>Rosa floccida var. castriferrei, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its stems are often covered in a thick layer of white hairs, which help to insulate the plant and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
