<p>Ridleyandra quercifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ridleyandra, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, palmate leaves that resemble those of oak trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. Ridleyandra quercifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
