<p>Rubus pirifolius, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of brambles native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in regions outside its native range.</p>
