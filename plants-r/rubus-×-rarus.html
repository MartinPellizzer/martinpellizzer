                    <h1>Rubus × rarus</h1>
<p>Rubus × rarus, commonly known as the rare raspberry hybrid, is a polyploid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus idaeus (common raspberry) and Rubus strigosus (brambles).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parents, including thorny stems and aggregate fruits composed of small drupelets. This hybrid is often found in temperate regions where its parent species overlap in habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid that showcases genetic diversity in the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively uncommon in cultivation due to its wild nature and specific ecological requirements.</p>
