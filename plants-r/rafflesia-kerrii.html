                    <h1>Rafflesia kerrii</h1>
<p>Rafflesia kerrii, commonly known as the giant broadleaf rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its vivid red petals are adorned with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rafflesia kerrii is classified as a vulnerable species.</p>
