<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>dysanthus, commonly known as the yellow water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into three segments, with a waxy surface that helps repel water.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic environments, with roots that anchor it in muddy substrates and specialized leaves for photosynthesis in water.</p>
