                    <h1>Ricinus communis var. glaucus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis var. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive bluish-green foliage.</p>
<p>The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a waxy coating that gives them their characteristic glaucous appearance. This variety is cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for oil production, as its seeds contain toxic ricin. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is also known for its striking red-orange flowers that appear in late summer.</p>
