                    <h1>Rumex acetosella var. viridis</h1>
<p>Rumex acetosella var. viridis, commonly known as common sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or bronze on the underside, with a sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more elongated leaves compared to other varieties of sorrel.</p>
