                    <h1>Rosettea echinata</h1>
<p>Rosettea echinata, commonly known as the spiny rosette plant, is a succulent native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, compact rosette of fleshy, spiky leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with white or yellowish spines along the edges. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
