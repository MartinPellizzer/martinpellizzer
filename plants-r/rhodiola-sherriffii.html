<p>Rhodiola sherriffii, commonly known as the Tibetan rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Rhodiola sherriffii is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic and antioxidant effects.</p>
