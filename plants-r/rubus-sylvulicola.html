                    <h1>Rubus sylvulicola</h1>
<p>Rubus sylvulicola, commonly known as the woodland raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often smaller and less flavorful than those of other Rubus species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species.</p>
