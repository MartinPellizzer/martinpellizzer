                    <h1>Rubus phyllophorus</h1>
<p>Rubus phyllophorus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically black when mature, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
