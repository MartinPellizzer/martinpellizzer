                    <h1>Rhysolepis robusta</h1>
<p>Rhysolepis robusta, commonly known as the robust lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, flat layer on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, moist environments. The thallus is lecanorine, with a distinct upper cortex and a medulla composed of loosely aggregated hyphae. It is often found on calcareous substrates, such as limestone, in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental conditions and is used in ecological studies to assess air quality.</p>
