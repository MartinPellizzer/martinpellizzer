<p>Rottboellia angolensis, commonly known as the African dog's-tail, is a perennial grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, pale green blades with a rough texture. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for grasses or sedges. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Rottboellia angolensis is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
