                    <h1>Ruschia socia</h1>
<p>Ruschia socia, commonly known as the red-stemmed Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically red or purple in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Ruschia socia is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
