<p>Rostraria recurviflora, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Rostraria recurviflora thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
