                    <h1>Roldana heterogama</h1>
<p>Roldana heterogama, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and its ability to thrive as an epiphyte on trees without requiring soil. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Botanists study Roldana heterogama to better understand its ecological role and conservation needs in threatened ecosystems.</p>
