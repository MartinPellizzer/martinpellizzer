                    <h1>Ricinus communis f. americanus</h1>
<p>Ricinus communis f. americanus, commonly known as the American castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, making it dangerous to handle. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage.</p>
