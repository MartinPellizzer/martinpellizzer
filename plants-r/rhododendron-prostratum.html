<p>Rhododendron prostratum, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, often blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings.</p>
