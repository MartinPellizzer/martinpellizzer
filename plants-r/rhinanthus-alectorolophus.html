The plant produces showy, orange-red flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are hemiparasitic, meaning they can derive some nutrients from neighboring plants.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus alectorolophus is often found in the UK and parts of Europe, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
