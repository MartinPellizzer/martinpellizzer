                    <h1>Rubus chamaemorus var. pseudochamaemorus</h1>
<p>Rubus chamaemorus var. pseudochamaemorus, commonly known as the dwarf crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in traditional foods. The plant has dense, mat-forming growth with hairy, leathery leaves that help it survive in cold climates. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the common crowberry but is distinguished by its smaller size and specific habitat preferences.</p>
