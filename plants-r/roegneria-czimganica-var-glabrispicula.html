<p>Roegneria czimganica var. glabrispicula, commonly known as the glabrous-spike wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are glabrous, meaning they lack hairs, giving it a smooth texture. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
