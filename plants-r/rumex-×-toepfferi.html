                    <h1>Rumex × toepfferi</h1>
<p>Rumex × toepfferi, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant typically features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near water bodies or in damp meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
