                    <h1>Rollandia sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Rollandia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf rollandia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk.
