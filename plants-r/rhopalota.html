                    <h1>Rhopalota</h1>
<p>Rhopalota, commonly known as the flat-tailed tree frog, is a genus of tree frogs found primarily in Central and South America.</p>
<p>These frogs are characterized by their distinctive flattened, triangular tail that aids in their arboreal lifestyle. Botanically, they are associated with humid tropical rainforests where they rely on dense vegetation for shelter and moisture. Their skin secretes a mucus that helps them retain hydration in their moist environment.</p>
<p>Rhopalota species play a role in the ecological balance of their habitats by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various predators.</p>
