                    <h1>Rheum nobile</h1>
<p>Rheum nobile, commonly known as the noble rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall, reddish stems. The plant produces showy, panicle-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are edible, though they contain high levels of oxalic acid, making them toxic if consumed raw.</p>
<p>Rheum nobile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
