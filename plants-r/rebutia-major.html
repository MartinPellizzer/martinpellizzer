<p>Rebutia major, commonly known as the giant stonecress, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically small and thick, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Rebutia major is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
