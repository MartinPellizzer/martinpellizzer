                    <h1>Ranunculus polystichus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus polystichus, commonly known as the fernleaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
