                    <h1>Ruschia nonimpressa</h1>
<p>Ruschia nonimpressa, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Ruschia nonimpressa is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through offsets, forming dense mats of foliage.</p>
