                    <h1>Resinanthus involucratus</h1>
<p>Resinanthus involucratus, commonly known as the clustered resin plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, which is one of its distinguishing features and has been used traditionally by indigenous communities. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in shrublands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments.</p>
