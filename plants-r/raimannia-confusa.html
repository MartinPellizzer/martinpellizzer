                    <h1>Raimannia confusa</h1>
<p>Raimannia confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white to pale green flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Raimannia confusa is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
