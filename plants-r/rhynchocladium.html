                    <h1>Rhynchocladium</h1>
<p>Rhynchocladium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of visible leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Rhynchocladium thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
