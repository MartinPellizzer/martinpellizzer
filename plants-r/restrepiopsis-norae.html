<p>Restrepiopsis norae, commonly known as the Andean mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its delicate, white to pale blue flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
