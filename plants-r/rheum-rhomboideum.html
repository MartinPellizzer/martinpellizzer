                    <h1>Rheum rhomboideum</h1>
<p>Rheum rhomboideum, commonly known as the rhubarb plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or pink veins. The plant produces tall, upright stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Rheum rhomboideum is closely related to the edible rhubarb species and shares similar botanical features.</p>
<p>Its leaves and stems contain high levels of oxalic acid, which makes them toxic if consumed raw.</p>
