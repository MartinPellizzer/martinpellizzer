<p>Rumex subrotundus, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features oval to kidney-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
