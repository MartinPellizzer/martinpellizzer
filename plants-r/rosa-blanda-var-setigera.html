<p>Rosa blanda var. setigera, commonly known as the creeping pink or cushion rose, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its foliage consists of small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value.</p>
