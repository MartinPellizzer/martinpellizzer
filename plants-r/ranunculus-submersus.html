<p>Ranunculus submersus, commonly known as the submerged buttercup, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to substrates. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, floating leaves that help in photosynthesis. Its flowers are yellow and usually appear above the water surface, though they may be short-lived.</p>
<p>Ranunculus submersus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
