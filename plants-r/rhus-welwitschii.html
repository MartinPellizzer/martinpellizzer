<p>Rhus welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschii tree, is a unique species native to Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red outer covering, which helps in seed dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Rhus welwitschii is adapted to arid environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
