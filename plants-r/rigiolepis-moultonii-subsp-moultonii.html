<p>Rigiolepis moultonii subsp.</p>
<p>moultonii, commonly known as the Moulton's rigiolepis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
