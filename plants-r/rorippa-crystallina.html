                    <h1>Rorippa crystallina</h1>
<p>Rorippa crystallina, commonly known as the crystalline water-cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, alternate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy crystals, giving it a sparkling appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the surface of water or growing in moist, aquatic environments. Rorippa crystallina is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research.</p>
