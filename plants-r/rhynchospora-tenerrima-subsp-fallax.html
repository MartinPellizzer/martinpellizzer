<p>Rhynchospora tenerrima subsp.</p>
<p>fallax, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in suitable environments.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
