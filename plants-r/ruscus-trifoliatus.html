                    <h1>Ruscus trifoliatus</h1>
<p>Ruscus trifoliatus, commonly known as common spurge or evergreen spurge, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features distinctive leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three narrow, pointed lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds.</p>
<p>Ruscus trifoliatus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
