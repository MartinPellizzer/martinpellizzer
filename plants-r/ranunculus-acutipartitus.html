<p>Ranunculus acutipartitus, commonly known as the sharp-toothed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, finely serrated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
