<p>Rosa alpina var. macrophylla, commonly known as the Alpine Rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically larger and more elongated than those of the typical Rosa alpina. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in early summer. It prefers well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates.</p>
