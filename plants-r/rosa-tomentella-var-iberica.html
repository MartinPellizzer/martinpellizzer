                    <h1>Rosa tomentella var. iberica</h1>
<p>Rosa tomentella var. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian woolly rose, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features dense, grayish-white hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in a thick layer of woolly hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and limestone soils, making it a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates.</p>
