<p>Restiaria leichhardtii, commonly known as the Leichhardt's restia, is a low-growing, perennial grass-like plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as plains and sand dunes.</p>
<p>Restiaria leichhardtii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
