<p>Robinia purpurea, commonly known as the false acacia or robinia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive pinkish-white color. The plant produces showy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it flowers in the spring with clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white blossoms. Robinia purpurea has a deep root system and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production.</p>
