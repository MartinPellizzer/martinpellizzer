                    <h1>Ryssopterys ovata</h1>
<p>Ryssopterys ovata, commonly known as the ovate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically ovate in shape, hence its common name. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Ryssopterys ovata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for humid, forested habitats.</p>
