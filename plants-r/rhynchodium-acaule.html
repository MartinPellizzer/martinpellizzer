<p>Rhynchodium acaule, commonly known as the stemless rhynchodium, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often shed during periods of drought, a characteristic adaptation to its arid environment.</p>
<p>Rhynchodium acaule is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
