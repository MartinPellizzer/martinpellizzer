<p>Rumex patientia subsp.</p>
<p>tibeticus, commonly known as Tibetan dock, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
