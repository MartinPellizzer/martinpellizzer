                    <h1>Rumex × griffithii</h1>
<p>Rumex × griffithii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (bog sorrel).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on tall, erect stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
