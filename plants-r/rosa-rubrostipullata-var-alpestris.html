                    <h1>Rosa rubrostipullata var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Rosa rubrostipullata var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a variant of the rubrostipullata species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, thorny stems that help it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
