                    <h1>Ruschia nivea</h1>
<p>Ruschia nivea, commonly known as the snow Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
