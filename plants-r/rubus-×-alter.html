                    <h1>Rubus × alter</h1>
<p>Rubus × alter, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub that belongs to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parent species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Rubus × alter is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits.</p>
