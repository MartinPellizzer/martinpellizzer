<p>Rubus afrogustafssonii, commonly known as the Afrogustafsson's raspberry, is a rare species of bramble native to specific regions in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
