<p>Rhipsalis floccosa, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a climbing cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, white, woolly covering on its stems, which gives it a unique and somewhat fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are typically small, round, and yellowish, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Rhipsalis floccosa is often found growing on trees and shrubs, forming dense clusters that can resemble a misty veil.</p>
