                    <h1>Rumex × gamsii</h1>
<p>Rumex × gamsii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (bog sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a wavy margin and a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, which is a characteristic of the genus Rumex. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of hybridization in the genus Rumex.</p>
