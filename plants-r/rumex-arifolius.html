                    <h1>Rumex arifolius</h1>
<p>Rumex arifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of large, lobed, and often hairy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant produces tall, unbranched flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
