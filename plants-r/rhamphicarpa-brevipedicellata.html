<p>Rhamphicarpa brevipedicellata, commonly known as the short-stalked bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, specialized leaves that form bladder-like structures used to trap microscopic aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it floats or grows submerged. Its flowers are small and yellow, with a distinctive spurred shape that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to photosynthesize while also supplementing its nutrient intake through prey capture.</p>
