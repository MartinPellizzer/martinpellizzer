<p>Rubus flexilis, commonly known as the flexible blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black drupelets, which are typically consumed by birds and mammals. Its leaves are alternate, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Rubus flexilis is often found in moist, woodland areas and thrives in partial shade.</p>
