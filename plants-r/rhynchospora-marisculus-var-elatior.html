<p>Rhynchospora marisculus var. elatior, commonly known as the salt marsh beakspur, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, thriving in conditions of high salinity and fluctuating water levels. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas along the shoreline.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
