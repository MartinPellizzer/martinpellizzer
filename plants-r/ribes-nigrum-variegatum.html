                    <h1>Ribes nigrum variegatum</h1>
<p>Ribes nigrum variegatum, commonly known as the variegated gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its attractive, variegated leaves that display shades of white, green, and yellow, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically yellow or orange in color, though they are less commonly consumed than its non-variegated counterpart. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil.</p>
<p>The variegation in its foliage is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in a unique visual appearance.</p>
