<p>Ranunculus hicanostylus, commonly known as the Hicanostylus buttercup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, and it has a distinctive, hairy stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
