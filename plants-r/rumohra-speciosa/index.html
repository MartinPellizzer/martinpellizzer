                            <h1>Rumohra Speciosa</h1>
<p>Cabbage tree, scientifically known as Rumohra speciosa, is a striking and unique plant native to New Zealand. This evergreen tree is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, cabbage-like leaves that give it its common name. While it is often mistaken for a tree, it is actually a grass species, belonging to the Poaceae family. Its distinctive appearance and cultural significance make it a notable feature in New Zealand's landscape. The cabbage tree has been historically used by Māori for various purposes, including food and construction.</p>
