                    <h1>Rheum hirsutum</h1>
<p>Rheum hirsutum, commonly known as the woolly rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhubarb-like appearance has led to its common name, though it is not typically cultivated for its edible stalks.</p>
<p>Rheum hirsutum is often found in rocky or arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
