                    <h1>Rubus fictus microgene orbifoliatus</h1>
<p>Rubus fictus microgene orbifoliatus, commonly known as the orb-leafed false raspberry, is a rare and distinctive species within the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its orbicular (rounded) leaves, which are typically hairy and have a unique, almost quilted texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or black in color, resembling those of true raspberries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
