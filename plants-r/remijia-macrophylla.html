<p>Remijia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrates of still or slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>Remijia macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems.</p>
