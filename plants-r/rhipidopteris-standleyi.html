<p>Rhipidopteris standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are borne on the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
