<p>Rubus koehleri microgene impolitus, commonly known as the Koehl's raspberry, is a rare and unique species within the Rubus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive, often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive. Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, is noted for its tart flavor and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
