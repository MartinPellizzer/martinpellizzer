<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>isophyllus, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five broad, spoon-shaped petals that resemble a shield, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, with basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
