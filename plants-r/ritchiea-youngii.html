                    <h1>Ritchiea youngii</h1>
<p>Ritchiea youngii, commonly known as the Young's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ritchiea youngii is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a significant subject of study in understanding the evolution of cycads.</p>
