                    <h1>Ritaia</h1>
<p>Ritaia, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly prized for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Ritaia grows slowly and is often found in dry, rocky soils, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now critically endangered and protected under international conservation laws.</p>
