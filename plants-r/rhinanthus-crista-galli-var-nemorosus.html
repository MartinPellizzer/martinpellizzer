                    <h1>Rhinanthus crista-galli var. nemorosus</h1>
<p>Rhinanthus crista-galli var. nemorosus, commonly known as the woodland dog's mercury, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. This variant is typically found in shaded woodland habitats, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, mature forest ecosystems.</p>
