                    <h1>Rubus mentitus</h1>
<p>Rubus mentitus, commonly known as the phantom raspberry, is a rare and elusive species of brambles native to the temperate forests of western Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers and small, edible berries that have a unique, slightly tart flavor. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along the edges of woodlands or in thick underbrush. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely serrated margins, and the stems are covered in soft, white hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and limited distribution, Rubus mentitus is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
