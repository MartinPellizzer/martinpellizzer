                            <h1>Rhododendron Sanguineum Subsp. Cloiophorum</h1>
<p>Red mountain azalea, scientifically known as Rhododendron sanguineum subsp. cloiophorum, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is prized for its vibrant red blooms that appear in late spring, adding a splash of color to forested landscapes. This subshrub thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners and horticulturists seeking to enhance their landscapes with native flora. Despite its beauty, the Red mountain azalea is also an important species for local ecosystems, supporting a variety of pollinators and wildlife.</p>
