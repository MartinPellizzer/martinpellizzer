<p>Rhipsalis monacantha var. samaipatana, commonly known as the Samaipata Rhipsalis, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the highlands of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are covered in small, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers during the summer months, followed by dark red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
