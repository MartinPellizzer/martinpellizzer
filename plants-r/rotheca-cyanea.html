<p>Rotheca cyanea, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and its clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a silvery bloom, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Rotheca cyanea is often used in native plant gardens for its attractive appearance and ability to support local pollinators.</p>
