<p>Roulinia racemosa, commonly known as the swamp beauty or yellow water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy, green leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinctive yellow flower that blooms in late summer. The plant has a submerged root system that helps stabilize the soil and provides habitat for aquatic life. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant spreads through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>Roulinia racemosa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and biodiversity.</p>
