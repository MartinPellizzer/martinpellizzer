<p>Robiquetia palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Robiquetia palustris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
