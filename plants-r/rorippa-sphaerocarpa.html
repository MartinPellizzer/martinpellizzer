                    <h1>Rorippa sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Rorippa sphaerocarpa, commonly known as globe watercress, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and the edges of ponds. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spherical, fleshy structure that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
