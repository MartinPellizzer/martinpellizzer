<p>Reynosia mucronata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Reynosia mucronata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
