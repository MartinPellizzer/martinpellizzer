                    <h1>Ranunculus aquatilis var. triphyllus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus aquatilis var. triphyllus, commonly known as the three-leaf water buttercup, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant features delicate, floating leaves that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. Its flowers are bright yellow with five petals and are often accompanied by numerous stamens.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other ranunculus species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
