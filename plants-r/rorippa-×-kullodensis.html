                    <h1>Rorippa × kullodensis</h1>
<p>Rorippa × kullodensis, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rorippa species, typically found in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in the axils of the leaves, and it is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Rorippa × kullodensis is a short-lived perennial that spreads through both seeds and vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model organism for studying hybridization and adaptation in wetland ecosystems.</p>
