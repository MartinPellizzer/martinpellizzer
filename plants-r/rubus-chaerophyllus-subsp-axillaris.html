<p>Rubus chaerophyllus subsp.</p>
<p>axillaris, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in late summer, followed by edible, red berries that are favored by wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
