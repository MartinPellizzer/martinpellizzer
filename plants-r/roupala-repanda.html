                    <h1>Roupala repanda</h1>
<p>Roupala repanda, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are typically alternate and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Roupala repanda is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
