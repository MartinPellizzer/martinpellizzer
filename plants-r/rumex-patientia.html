                    <h1>Rumex patientia</h1>
<p>Rumex patientia, commonly known as common sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Rumex patientia is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
