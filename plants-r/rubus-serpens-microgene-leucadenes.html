<p>Rubus serpens microgene leucadenes, commonly known as the white-flowered blackberry shrub, is a species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, thorny stems.</p>
<p>It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, which are a defining botanical feature. The plant's leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and its fruits are aggregate berries that develop from the fusion of multiple small drupes. It is native to temperate regions of the Americas and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique combination of morphological traits and genetic variability within its subspecies.</p>
