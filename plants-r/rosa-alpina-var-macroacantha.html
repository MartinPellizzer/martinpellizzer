                    <h1>Rosa alpina var. macroacantha</h1>
<p>Rosa alpina var. macroacantha, commonly known as the Alpine large-thorned rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves composed of five to seven elliptical, serrated leaflets. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are armed with stout, curved prickles, which are more prominent than those of the typical Rosa alpina.</p>
<p>This variety thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
