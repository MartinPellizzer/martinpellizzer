                    <h1>Ranunculus oreophytus var. stolonifer</h1>
<p>Ranunculus oreophytus var. stolonifer, commonly known as the stoloniferous alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of finely divided, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in mountain ecosystems.</p>
