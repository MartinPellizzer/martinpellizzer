                    <h1>Ritchiea tessmannii</h1>
<p>Ritchiea tessmannii, commonly known as the Tessmann's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the cycad family, Cycadaceae, and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ritchiea tessmannii is considered critically endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts.</p>
