<p>Rapanea ferruginea f. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic ironwood, is a rare variant of the ironwood tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
