<p>Blackberry bush, scientifically known as Rubus plicatus subsp. divaricatus, is a thorny shrub native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is prized for its edible berries, which are rich in antioxidants and flavor. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. The blackberry bush plays an important role in both ecosystems and human agriculture.</p>
