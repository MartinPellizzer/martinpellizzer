                    <h1>Ruprechtia fagifolia</h1>
<p>Ruprechtia fagifolia, commonly known as the maple-leafed ruprechtia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, maple-like leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its foliage rather than its flowers or fruits.</p>
