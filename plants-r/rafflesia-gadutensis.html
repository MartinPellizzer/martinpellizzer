                    <h1>Rafflesia gadutensis</h1>
<p>Rafflesia gadutensis, commonly known as the "Gadutensis Rafflesia," is a rare and striking parasitic plant found in the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Despite its dramatic appearance, Rafflesia gadutensis is extremely rare and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
