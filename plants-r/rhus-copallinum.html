                    <h1>Rhus copallinum</h1>
<p>Rhus copallinum, commonly known as the sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn a striking red color in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its roots and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested.</p>
<p>Rhus copallinum is often found in dry, open woods and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
