<p>Rhipsalis funalis var. minor, commonly known as the miniature rhipsalis, is a compact, trailing cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, soft green stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the winter months, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets.</p>
