                    <h1>Roupala brasiliensis var. laevigata</h1>
<p>Roupala brasiliensis var. laevigata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and elliptical leaves that are leathery and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is highly prized in musical instrument making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
