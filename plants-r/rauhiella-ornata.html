                    <h1>Rauhiella ornata</h1>
<p>Rauhiella ornata, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often has a slight waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are small, spineless, and arranged in a rosette formation, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Rauhiella ornata is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
