                    <h1>Ranunculus vernyi</h1>
<p>Ranunculus vernyi, commonly known as the spring buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters, featuring erect stems and basal leaves that are trifoliate or palmately lobed. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, though they are technically not true petals. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and prefers well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Ranunculus vernyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, cheerful flowers.</p>
