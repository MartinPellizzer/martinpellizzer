                    <h1>Rumex lachanus</h1>
<p>Rumex lachanus, commonly known as the marsh sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged, especially along the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. It is typically found in shallow water or damp soil, often growing in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Rumex lachanus is valued for its edible leaves, which have a slightly sour taste similar to sorrel.</p>
