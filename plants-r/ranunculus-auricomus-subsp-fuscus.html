<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>fuscus, commonly known as the brown-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often have a reddish or brownish hue, distinguishing it from the more common white-leaved varieties.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
