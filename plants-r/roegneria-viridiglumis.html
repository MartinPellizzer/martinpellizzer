<p>Roegneria viridiglumis, commonly known as the green-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with green bracts, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that distinguishes it from other grass species.</p>
<p>Roegneria viridiglumis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
