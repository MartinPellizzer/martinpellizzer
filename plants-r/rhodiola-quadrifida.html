                    <h1>Rhodiola quadrifida</h1>
<p>Rhodiola quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leaf rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of yellow or orange flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to store water and nutrients efficiently, adapting to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Rhodiola quadrifida is also valued for its potential adaptogenic properties, though its botanical features are more notable for their structural resilience and ecological niche.</p>
