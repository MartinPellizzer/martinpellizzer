<p>Rosa canina subvar. nemophila, commonly known as the alpine rose or mountain dogwood, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces bright red hips, which are the fruit, containing seeds encased in a fuzzy, persistent covering. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and the plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Rosa canina subvar. nemophila is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments.</p>
