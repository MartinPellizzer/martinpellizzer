<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>parvulifactus, commonly known as the small-flowered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-orange flowers with five broadly ovate petals and a distinctive central yellow gland.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with lobes that are usually less deeply cut than those of the typical species.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its smaller flower size and more compact growth habit compared to its relatives.</p>
