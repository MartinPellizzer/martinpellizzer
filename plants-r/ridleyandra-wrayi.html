                    <h1>Ridleyandra wrayi</h1>
<p>Ridleyandra wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's ridleyandra, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland forest environments, often in shaded understory conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, with distinctive sepals that persist through fruiting, a feature that sets it apart from many related species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ridleyandra wrayi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
