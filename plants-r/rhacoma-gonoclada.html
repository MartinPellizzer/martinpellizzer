                    <h1>Rhacoma gonoclada</h1>
<p>Rhacoma gonoclada, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spiral-shaped thallus that forms a dense, carpet-like growth on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a flattened, ribbon-like body called a thallus. Rhacoma gonoclada reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
