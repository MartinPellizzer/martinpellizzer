                    <h1>Rochelia barbata</h1>
<p>Rochelia barbata, commonly known as the barbed rosette, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are covered in fine, barbed hairs. The plant is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, appear in early spring and are borne on short, erect stems.</p>
<p>Rochelia barbata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
