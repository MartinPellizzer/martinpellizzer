<p>Rosa canina var. subglaucescens, commonly known as the pale rose or subglaucescent dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and hairy stems, which distinguish it from the typical Rosa canina. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. It produces rose hips that are typically smaller and less showy than those of the common dog rose.</p>
<p>This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodlands and scrub habitats.</p>
