                    <h1>Rhamnus crocea var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Rhamnus crocea var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
