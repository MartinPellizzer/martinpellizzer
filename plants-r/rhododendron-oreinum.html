                    <h1>Rhododendron oreinum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron oreinum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. The plant features dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, often in shades of pink, red, or white. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display.</p>
<p>Rhododendron oreinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment.</p>
