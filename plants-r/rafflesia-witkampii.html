                    <h1>Rafflesia witkampii</h1>
<p>Rafflesia witkampii, commonly known as the Kampuchean Rafflesia, is a rare and striking parasitic plant found in the dense rainforests of Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing one of the largest flowers in the world, with a diameter that can reach up to 1 meter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flower has a distinctive reddish-brown color with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts flies as pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
