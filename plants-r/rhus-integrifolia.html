                    <h1>Rhus integrifolia</h1>
<p>Rhus integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have smooth, entire margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it often grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks or in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Rhus integrifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
