<p>Roegneria rigidula, commonly known as the rigid false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and rocky soils, preferring temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Roegneria rigidula is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
