<p>Rhinanthus melampyroides, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic nature, though it does not completely drain its host. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in grasslands and along the edges of woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus melampyroides plays an important ecological role by promoting biodiversity through its interaction with host plants and supporting insect populations.</p>
