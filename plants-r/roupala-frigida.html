                    <h1>Roupala frigida</h1>
<p>Roupala frigida, commonly known as the Antarctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the extreme southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, dark green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its fruit is a small, hairy capsule containing seeds. Roupala frigida is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the unique ecosystems found in southern Patagonia.</p>
