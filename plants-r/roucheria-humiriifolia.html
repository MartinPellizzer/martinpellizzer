                    <h1>Roucheria humiriifolia</h1>
<p>Roucheria humiriifolia, commonly known as the swampy leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in wetland or marshy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ecological and aesthetic value.</p>
