                    <h1>Rhus nebulosa f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Rhus nebulosa f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent smooth sumac, is a variant of the smooth sumac native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy (pubescent) leaves, which distinguish it from the typical smooth sumac. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife.</p>
