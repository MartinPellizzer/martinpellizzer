                    <h1>Rutaea quercifolia</h1>
<p>Rutaea quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved rutaea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that resemble those of oak trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Rutaea quercifolia is often found in woodland edges and moist thickets, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
