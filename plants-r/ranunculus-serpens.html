<p>Ranunculus serpens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Ranunculus serpens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
