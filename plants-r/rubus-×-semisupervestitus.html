                    <h1>Rubus × semisupervestitus</h1>
<p>Rubus × semisupervestitus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (evergreen raspberry) and Rubus  glaucus (blackberry).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that range in color from red to black, depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal regions where its parent species overlap.</p>
<p>Due to its unique genetic makeup, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent plants, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
