                    <h1>Rubus × peracer</h1>
<p>Rubus × peracer, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a polyploid plant resulting from the cross between blackberries (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberries (Rubus idaeus).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring thorny stems and aggregate fruits that are typically red to black in color. The plant is known for its vigorous growth and adaptability to various soil types, making it a common sight in hedgerows and disturbed areas. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces achenes that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Rubus × peracer is often difficult to classify taxonomically.</p>
