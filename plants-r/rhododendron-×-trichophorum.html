                    <h1>Rhododendron × trichophorum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron × trichophorum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron ferrugineum and Rhododendron ponticum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures, making it well-suited for alpine and subalpine environments. The plant typically grows as a shrub with broad, leathery leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>The woolly rhododendron is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and forested slopes.</p>
