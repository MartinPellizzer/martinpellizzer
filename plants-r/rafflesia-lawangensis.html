                    <h1>Rafflesia lawangensis</h1>
<p>Rafflesia lawangensis, commonly known as the Lawangensis Rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is notable for producing one of the largest individual flowers in the world, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling rotting flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant's unique biology and striking appearance make it a rare and fascinating subject in botanical study.</p>
