                    <h1>Rhamnus albida</h1>
<p>Rhamnus albida, commonly known as the white buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
