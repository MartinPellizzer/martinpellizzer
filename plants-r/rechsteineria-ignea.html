<p>Rechsteineria ignea, commonly known as the flame-colored orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure typical of many orchid genera.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
