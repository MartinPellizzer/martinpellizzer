<p>Raddia urbaniana, commonly known as the Urbanian raddia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Raddia urbaniana is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research.</p>
