<p>Rubus recondiformis, commonly known as the rare raspberry shrub, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant.</p>
