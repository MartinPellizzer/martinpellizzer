<p>Rumex conglomeratus subsp.</p>
<p>nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada dock, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and in meadows.</p>
<p>The plant has basal rosettes of broad, lobed leaves and produces erect flowering stems with small, greenish flowers. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects.</p>
