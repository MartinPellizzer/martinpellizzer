                    <h1>Rubus candicans var. seciurensis</h1>
<p>Rubus candicans var. seciurensis, commonly known as the red-berried trailing blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in the summer months. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they appear in clusters before the berries develop.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and, in some cases, for its edible fruits.</p>
