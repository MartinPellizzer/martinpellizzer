                    <h1>Rhododendron × burriflorum</h1>
<p>Rhododendron × burriflorum, commonly known as the Burryflower rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often cultivated as a shrub for ornamental purposes. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish throat. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of many modern rhododendron cultivars.</p>
