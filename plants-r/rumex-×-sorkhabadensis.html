<p>Rumex × sorkhabadensis, commonly known as the Sorkhabad dock, is a hybrid plant species resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosella and Rumex acetosa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are usually borne on erect, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
