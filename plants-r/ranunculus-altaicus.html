                    <h1>Ranunculus altaicus</h1>
<p>Ranunculus altaicus, commonly known as the Altai buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features a short, stout stem that bears several palmately divided, bright yellow flowers with numerous petals. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Ranunculus altaicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, daisy-like blooms.</p>
