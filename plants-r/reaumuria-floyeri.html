<p>Reaumuria floyeri, commonly known as the Floyer's tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Reaumuria floyeri plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
