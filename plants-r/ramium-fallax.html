The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Ramium fallax is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and damp meadows, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
