                    <h1>Rosa canina f. lasiostylis</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. lasiostylis, commonly known as the hairy-styled dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy styles on the female flowers, which set it apart from the typical form of Rosa canina. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland and hedgerow habitats. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red hips in autumn.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to its natural environment, contributing to its ecological significance in supporting pollinators and wildlife.</p>
