<p>Rhipsalis cassytha var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender, leafless stems that dangle from trees, giving it a delicate, vine-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
