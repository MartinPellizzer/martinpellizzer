                    <h1>Rhynchospora sclerioides var. marquisensis</h1>
<p>Rhynchospora sclerioides var. marquisensis, commonly known as the Marquis Island spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Marquesas Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or pale brown in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Its flowers are monoecious, with separate male and female inflorescences, and it reproduces through wind pollination.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
