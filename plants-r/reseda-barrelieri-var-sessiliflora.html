                    <h1>Reseda barrelieri var. sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Reseda barrelieri var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved reseda, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in racemes. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with mechanisms to reduce water loss and tolerate high temperatures.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
