<p>Robinsonella pilosa subsp.</p>
<p>pilosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its fleshy, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has submerged, branched stems with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish and are borne on short stalks above the water surface.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its role in nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems.</p>
