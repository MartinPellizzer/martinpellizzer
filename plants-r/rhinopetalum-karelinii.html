                    <h1>Rhinopetalum karelinii</h1>
<p>Rhinopetalum karelinii, commonly known as the Karelin's rhinopetalum, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, elongated spur that extends from the base of the flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with a combination of white and green hues that help it blend into its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rhinopetalum karelinii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
