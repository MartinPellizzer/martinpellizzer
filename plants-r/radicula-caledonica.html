                    <h1>Radicula caledonica</h1>
<p>Radicula caledonica, commonly known as the Scottish heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Radicula caledonica is well adapted to harsh, wind-swept environments and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats.</p>
