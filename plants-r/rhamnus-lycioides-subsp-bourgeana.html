<p>Rhamnus lycioides subsp.</p>
<p>bourgeana, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, black berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal scrub and dunes, playing a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
