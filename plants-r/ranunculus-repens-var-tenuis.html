                    <h1>Ranunculus repens var. tenuis</h1>
<p>Ranunculus repens var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a common weed and an ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
