                    <h1>Rubus serpens var. elongatifolius</h1>
<p>Rubus serpens var. elongatifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are typically longer than those of the standard Rubus serpens. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
