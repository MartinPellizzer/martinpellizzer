                    <h1>Rumex × gombae</h1>
<p>Rumex × gombae, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical characteristics. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a wavy margin and a reddish or purple underside, while the stems are often reddish and hairy. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and the plant is often found in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Rumex × gombae exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its genetic parents and environmental conditions.</p>
