                    <h1>Rosa canina f. adscita</h1>
<p>Rosa canina f. adscita, commonly known as the dog rose form adscita, is a botanical variant of the dog rose, characterized by its distinct floral and foliage features.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Rosa canina, with smaller, more densely packed flowers. The leaves are usually more serrated and have a slightly different coloration than the standard species. It is often found in similar habitats, such as woodland edges and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
