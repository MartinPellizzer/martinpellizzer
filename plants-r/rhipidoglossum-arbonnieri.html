                    <h1>Rhipidoglossum arbonnieri</h1>
<p>Rhipidoglossum arbonnieri, commonly known as the Florida panther lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish-green thallus, which often features distinct lobes and a finely granular texture. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of cyanobacteria, which contributes to its nutrient acquisition. It is typically found on decaying wood in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
