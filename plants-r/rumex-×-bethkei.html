<p>Rumex × bethkei, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipenis (broadleaf sorrel). The plant typically features broad, arrow-shaped leaves with a reddish coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
