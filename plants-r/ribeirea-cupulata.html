                    <h1>Ribeirea cupulata</h1>
<p>Ribeirea cupulata, commonly known as the cupulate ribeira, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures, giving it its common name. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible and serve as a food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Ribeirea cupulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and unique floral display.</p>
