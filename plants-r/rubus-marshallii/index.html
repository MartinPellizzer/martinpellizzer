                            <h1>Rubus Marshallii</h1>
<p>Rubus marshallii is a rare and striking member of the rose family known for its unique appearance and ecological significance. Native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its foliage features large, lobed leaves that stand out against the forest floor, while its flowers add a splash of color in early summer. Despite its beauty, Rubus marshallii is often overlooked due to its subtle presence in natural habitats. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this plant from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
