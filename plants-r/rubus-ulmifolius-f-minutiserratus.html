                    <h1>Rubus ulmifolius f. minutiserratus</h1>
<p>Rubus ulmifolius f. minutiserratus, commonly known as the small-toothed bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves, which are smaller and more slender than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are often less showy than the fruits of other Rubus species. It is typically found in woodland edges and hedgerows across Europe.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare form within the Rubus genus.</p>
