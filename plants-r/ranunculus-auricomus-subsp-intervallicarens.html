<p>Ranunculus auricomus subsp.</p>
<p>intervallicarens, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, which are often adorned with a distinctive white or greenish border. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its unique flowering pattern, where flowers open in a staggered manner over several days.</p>
