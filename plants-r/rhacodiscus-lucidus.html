<p>Rhacodiscus lucidus, commonly known as the shining water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its aquatic habitat. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>Rhacodiscus lucidus plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
