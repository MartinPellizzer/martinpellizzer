<p>Rumex thyrsiflorus subsp.</p>
<p>papillaris, commonly known as the rough dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in small, raised dots, giving them a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear dense, club-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers that develop into reddish-brown, three-lobed seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
