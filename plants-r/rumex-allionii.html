                    <h1>Rumex allionii</h1>
<p>Rumex allionii, commonly known as the creeping dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread rapidly across moist, often disturbed soils. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring. It is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are edible but can be somewhat tart, and the plant has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
