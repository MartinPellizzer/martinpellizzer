<p>Jussiaea yacumensis, commonly known as the Yacum√©n or Yacumense water plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water bodies and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the surface. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white flowers during the warmer months. Jussiaea yacumensis is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments and can play a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful plant for water filtration and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
