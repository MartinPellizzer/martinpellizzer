<p>Juncus ambiguus var. ossoraicus, commonly known as the Ossoraica rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, riparian areas, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
