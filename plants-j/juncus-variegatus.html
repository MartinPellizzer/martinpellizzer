                    <h1>Juncus variegatus</h1>
<p>Juncus variegatus, commonly known as the variegated rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green with white or yellow markings, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Juncus variegatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions.</p>
