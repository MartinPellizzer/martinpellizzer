                    <h1>Jatropha horrida</h1>
<p>Jatropha horrida, commonly known as the rough jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for ornamental use in residential gardens.</p>
