                    <h1>Juniperus wallichiana var. loderi</h1>
<p>Juniperus wallichiana var. loderi, commonly known as the Loder's juniper, is a variety of the Chinese juniper native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves. The foliage is typically bluish-green, with small, scale-like leaves that are closely packed along the branches. It produces small, round blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
