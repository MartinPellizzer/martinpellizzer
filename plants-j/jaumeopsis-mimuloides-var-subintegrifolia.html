                    <h1>Jaumeopsis mimuloides var. subintegrifolia</h1>
<p>Jaumeopsis mimuloides var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed jaumeopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive subintegrifoliate margin, meaning the leaf edges are almost entirely joined to the midrib.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance.</p>
