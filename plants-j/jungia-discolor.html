                    <h1>Jungia discolor</h1>
<p>Jungia discolor, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pinkish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, delicate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Jungia discolor is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
