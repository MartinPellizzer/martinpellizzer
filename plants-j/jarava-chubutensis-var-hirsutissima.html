<p>Jarava chubutensis var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the Hirsute Jarava, is a perennial grass native to the Patagonian region of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in open grasslands.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its particularly hairy foliage, which gives it its common name.</p>
