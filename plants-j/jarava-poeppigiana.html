<p>Jarava poeppigiana, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Jarava poeppigiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
