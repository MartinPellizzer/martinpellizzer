<p>Jatropha maracayensis, commonly known as the Maracayensis physic nut, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes cultivated for its potential in biofuel production.</p>
<p>However, its milky latex and toxic seeds make it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>
