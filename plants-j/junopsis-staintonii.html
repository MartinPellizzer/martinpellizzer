<p>Junopsis staintonii, commonly known as the Stainton's juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cupressaceae, which includes junipers and cypresses, and is characterized by its scale-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Junopsis staintonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
