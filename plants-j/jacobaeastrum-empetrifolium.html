<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments.</p>
