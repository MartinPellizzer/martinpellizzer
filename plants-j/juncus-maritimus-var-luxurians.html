                    <h1>Juncus maritimus var. luxurians</h1>
<p>Juncus maritimus var. luxurians, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a variant of the common rush that thrives in saline and brackish environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, marshes, and estuaries, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>The plant's fibrous roots and rhizomes contribute to its resilience in harsh, wetland conditions.</p>
