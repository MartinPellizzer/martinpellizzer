<p>Juniperus mexicana var. monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features include compact growth habits and a long lifespan, often exceeding 100 years.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in desert ecosystems.</p>
