                    <h1>Juncus capitatus f. physcomitrioides</h1>
<p>Juncus capitatus f. physcomitrioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a variant of the common rush species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tip of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its resemblance to the aquatic plant Physcomitrium, giving it its specific epithet.</p>
