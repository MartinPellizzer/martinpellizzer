<p>Juncus glaucus f. macrocarpus, commonly known as the broad-fruited rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream sides.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms.</p>
