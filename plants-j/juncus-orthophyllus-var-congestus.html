<p>Juncus orthophyllus var. congestus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered closely together.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife.</p>
