                    <h1>Juncus proximus</h1>
<p>Juncus proximus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments across much of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, grass-like leaves that often grow in moist soil or shallow water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Juncus proximus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common and resilient species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
