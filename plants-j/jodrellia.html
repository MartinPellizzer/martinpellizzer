                    <h1>Jodrellia</h1>
<p>Jodrellia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom on slender stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Jodrellia has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern.</p>
