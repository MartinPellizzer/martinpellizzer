                    <h1>Juno hippolyti</h1>
<p>Juno hippolyti, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Juno hippolyti is valued for its ornamental beauty and its historical significance in African cultures.</p>
