                    <h1>Juncus bufonius var. parvulus</h1>
<p>Juncus bufonius var. parvulus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in height, contributing to its overall dwarf stature. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions and its role in stabilizing shoreline vegetation.</p>
