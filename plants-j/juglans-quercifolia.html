                    <h1>Juglans quercifolia</h1>
<p>Juglans quercifolia, commonly known as the mock walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of oak trees. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, walnut-like fruits that are encased in a thick, spiny husk. Its bark is rugged and ridged, and the wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for carpentry and furniture-making.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats.</p>
