<p>Jurinea xerophytica, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, appearing in early spring.</p>
<p>Jurinea xerophytica is well-suited to extreme drought conditions and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats.</p>
