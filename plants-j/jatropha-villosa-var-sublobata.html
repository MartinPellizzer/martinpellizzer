                    <h1>Jatropha villosa var. sublobata</h1>
<p>Jatropha villosa var. sublobata, commonly known as the hairy jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves with a serrated or lobed margin. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential for biofuel production, it is sometimes cultivated despite its toxic properties.</p>
