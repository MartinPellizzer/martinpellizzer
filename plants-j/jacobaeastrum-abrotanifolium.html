<p>Jacobaeastrum abrotanifolium, commonly known as the Mexican thistle, is a perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves that resemble those of the abrotanum genus, hence its specific epithet. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
