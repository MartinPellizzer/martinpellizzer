                    <h1>Juncus bulbosus var. salinus</h1>
<p>Juncus bulbosus var. salinus, commonly known as salt marsh rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish flowers. This variety is highly adapted to saline environments, tolerating high levels of salt in the soil and water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize shorelines.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various species.</p>
