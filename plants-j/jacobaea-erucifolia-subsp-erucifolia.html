<p>Jacobaea erucifolia subsp.</p>
<p>erucifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features basal rosettes of linear, often hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its scientific name reflects its historical association with the genus *Hieracium*, which includes various hawkweed species.</p>
