                    <h1>Jarava durifolia</h1>
<p>Jarava durifolia, commonly known as hardleaf jarava, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, rigid leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>Jarava durifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
