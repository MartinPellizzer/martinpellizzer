<p>Jacobinia amphibola, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Jacobinia, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Jacobinia amphibola plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
