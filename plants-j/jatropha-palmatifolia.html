                    <h1>Jatropha palmatifolia</h1>
<p>Jatropha palmatifolia, commonly known as the Natal holly or Natal poisonwood, is a tropical shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are palmately arranged with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries containing toxic seeds. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, making it potentially hazardous to handle.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage.</p>
