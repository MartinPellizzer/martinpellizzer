                    <h1>Juncus × langii</h1>
<p>Juncus × langii, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial plant that belongs to the Juncaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Juncus effusus and Juncus roemerianus, two native North American rush species. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and tidal areas, where it thrives in brackish or freshwater conditions. It has cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color.</p>
<p>Juncus × langii is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species in its native range.</p>
