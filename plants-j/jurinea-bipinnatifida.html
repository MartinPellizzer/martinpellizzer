<p>Jurinea bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are finely divided and pinnatifid, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Jurinea bipinnatifida is often found in dunes and gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root network.</p>
