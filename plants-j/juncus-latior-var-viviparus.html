                    <h1>Juncus latior var. viviparus</h1>
<p>Juncus latior var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-yellow flowers. One of its notable features is its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which can root and grow into new plants while still attached to the parent.</p>
<p>This adaptation aids in its propagation in moist environments.</p>
