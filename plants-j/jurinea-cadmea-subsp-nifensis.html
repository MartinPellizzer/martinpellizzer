<p>The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are generally linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal and desert soils.</p>
