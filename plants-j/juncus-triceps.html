                    <h1>Juncus triceps</h1>
<p>Juncus triceps, commonly known as the three-branched rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus triceps is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
