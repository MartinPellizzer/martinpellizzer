<p>Juncus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bright green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Juncus pumilus is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
