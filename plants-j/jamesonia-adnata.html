<p>Jamesonia adnata, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens.</p>
