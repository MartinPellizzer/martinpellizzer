                    <h1>Jurinea gabrieliae</h1>
<p>Jurinea gabrieliae, commonly known as the Gabriel's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jurinea gabrieliae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
