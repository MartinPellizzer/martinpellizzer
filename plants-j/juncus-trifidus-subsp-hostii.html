<p>Juncus trifidus subsp.</p>
<p>hostii, commonly known as the Host's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its trifid (three-lobed) leaves, which give it its scientific name.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
