<p>Jaltomata hunzikeri, commonly known as the Hunziker's groundcherry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean highlands of South America, specifically Bolivia and Peru, where it grows in rocky, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange fruits that are enclosed in a leafy calyx, resembling a cherry. It is a perennial herb with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers with five petals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jaltomata hunzikeri is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
