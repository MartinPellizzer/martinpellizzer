<p>Jasione crispa subsp.</p>
<p>mariana, commonly known as the Maritime Jasione, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, branched stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
