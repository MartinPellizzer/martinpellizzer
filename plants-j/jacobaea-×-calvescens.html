                    <h1>Jacobaea × calvescens</h1>
<p>Jacobaea × calvescens, commonly known as the common tansy, is a hybrid perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dark green, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds like thujone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
