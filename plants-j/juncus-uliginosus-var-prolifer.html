                    <h1>Juncus uliginosus var. prolifer</h1>
<p>Juncus uliginosus var. prolifer, commonly known as the marsh rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous base. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, contributing to its dense growth habit in wetland habitats.</p>
