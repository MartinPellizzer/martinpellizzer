                    <h1>Juncus lampocarpus f. natans</h1>
<p>Juncus lampocarpus f. natans, commonly known as the floating rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits unique aquatic adaptations.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its elongated, flexible stems that allow it to float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant reproduces through rhizomes, spreading vegetatively to colonize wetland areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing water edges and filtering water.</p>
