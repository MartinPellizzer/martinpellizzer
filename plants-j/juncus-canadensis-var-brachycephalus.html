<p>Juncus canadensis var. brachycephalus, commonly known as the short-headed rush, is a variant of the common rush found in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often crowded at the base, forming a compact rosette. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
