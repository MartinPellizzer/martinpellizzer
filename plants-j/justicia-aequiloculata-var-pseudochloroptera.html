                    <h1>Justicia aequiloculata var. pseudochloroptera</h1>
<p>Justicia aequiloculata var. pseudochloroptera, commonly known as the silverleaf justicia, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a contrasting yellow throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
