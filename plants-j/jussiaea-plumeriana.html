<p>Jussiaea plumeriana, commonly known as the Brazilian water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has dark green, waxy leaves that are broad and oval in shape, often with a slight curl. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically blooming in clusters. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
