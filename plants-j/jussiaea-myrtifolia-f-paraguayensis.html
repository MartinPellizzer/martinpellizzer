<p>Jussiaea myrtifolia f. paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay river willow, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America, particularly the Paraguay River basin.</p>
<p>It typically grows along the margins of slow-moving freshwater bodies, where it thrives in moist, muddy soils. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and lanceolate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikes, and it is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
