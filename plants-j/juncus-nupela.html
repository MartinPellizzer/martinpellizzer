<p>Juncus nupela, commonly known as the white rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Juncus nupela plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
