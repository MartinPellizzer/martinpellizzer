                    <h1>Juncus depauperatus</h1>
<p>Juncus depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse rush, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 30 inches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in early spring, which are borne in spike-like clusters. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
