<p>Juncus mutabilis var. ranarius, commonly known as the variable rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland wildlife.</p>
