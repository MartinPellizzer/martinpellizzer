<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, and its small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Juniperus sargentii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and distinctive appearance.</p>
