<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by seed production. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, dry soils.</p>
<p>Jurinea kerstanii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is an indicator species of desert ecosystems.</p>
