                    <h1>Jussiaea pseudonarcissus</h1>
<p>Jussiaea pseudonarcissus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-milfoil, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water surface, with small, narrow leaves arranged in whorls. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Jussiaea pseudonarcissus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
