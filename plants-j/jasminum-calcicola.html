<p>Jasminum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone jasmine, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, which is reflected in its common name. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Jasminum calcicola is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
