                    <h1>Juncus tyraicus</h1>
<p>Juncus tyraicus, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus tyraicus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
