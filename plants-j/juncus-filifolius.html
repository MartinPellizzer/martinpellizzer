<p>Juncus filifolius, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a vital role in providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>The plant is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
