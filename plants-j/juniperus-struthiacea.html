                    <h1>Juniperus struthiacea</h1>
<p>Juniperus struthiacea, commonly known as the cliff juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found growing on cliffs, slopes, and in desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
