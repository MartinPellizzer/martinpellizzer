<p>Jurinea berardioides, commonly known as the desert sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jurinea berardioides is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
