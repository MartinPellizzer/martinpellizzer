<p>Juncus conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It forms dense clumps of grass-like, cylindrical stems that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Juncus conglomeratus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
