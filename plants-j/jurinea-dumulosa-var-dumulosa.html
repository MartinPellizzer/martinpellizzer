                    <h1>Jurinea dumulosa var. dumulosa</h1>
<p>Jurinea dumulosa var. dumulosa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that help it survive in harsh environments by reducing water loss and protecting against extreme temperatures. The plant has small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which further aid in water conservation. It produces yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with limited moisture.</p>
