<p>Juncus articulatus subsp.</p>
<p>macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color, and it produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brown flowers at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>The plant has jointed stems, a characteristic feature of the Juncaceae family, which allows it to withstand waterlogged conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in tufts at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
