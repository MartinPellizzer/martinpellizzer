                    <h1>Juncus arcticus var. sitchensis</h1>
<p>Juncus arcticus var. sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka rush, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, typically growing in moist to wet environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in wetlands and streambanks.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly adapted to cold climates and is often found in coastal areas with high humidity.</p>
