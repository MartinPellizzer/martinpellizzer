                    <h1>Juncus balticus f. pusillus</h1>
<p>Juncus balticus f. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf bog rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in northern Europe.</p>
<p>It forms dense clusters of slender, grass-like stems that are typically less than 20 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to shallow water and is often found in peat bogs and marshes.</p>
