<p>Juncus balticus var. columnaris, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, making it a striking feature in moist environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and marshes.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective natural stabilizer for shoreline vegetation.</p>
