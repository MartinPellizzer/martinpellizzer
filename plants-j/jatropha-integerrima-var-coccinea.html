                    <h1>Jatropha integerrima var. coccinea</h1>
<p>Jatropha integerrima var. coccinea, commonly known as the red-veined jatropha, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that display vibrant red veins against a deep green background. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that transition into bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for edibility.</p>
