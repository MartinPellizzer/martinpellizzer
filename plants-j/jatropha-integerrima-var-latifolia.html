                    <h1>Jatropha integerrima var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Jatropha integerrima var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf physic nut, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces toxic, milky sap that can cause skin irritation, and its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its toxic properties, it has been studied for its potential use in biofuel production.</p>
