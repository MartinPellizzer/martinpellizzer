                    <h1>Juno narynensis</h1>
<p>Juno narynensis, commonly known as the Karakoram juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Karakoram and surrounding mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its compact growth form and ability to thrive in extreme conditions make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Juno narynensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
