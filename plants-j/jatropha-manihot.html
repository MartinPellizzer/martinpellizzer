                    <h1>Jatropha manihot</h1>
<p>Jatropha manihot, commonly known as arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that give way to orange, fleshy fruits. The plant's underground stems, or rhizomes, are the primary source of its starchy, edible tubers. These tubers are rich in carbohydrates and have been used as a food source for centuries.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jatropha manihot is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage.</p>
