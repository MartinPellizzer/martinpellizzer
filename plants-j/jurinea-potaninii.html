<p>Jurinea potaninii, commonly known as the snowbean, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Jurinea potaninii is adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
