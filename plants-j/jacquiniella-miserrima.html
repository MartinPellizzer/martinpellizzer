<p>Jacquiniella miserrima, commonly known as the weeping lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Jacquiniella miserrima is adapted to cool, humid environments and thrives in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
