<p>Jurinea humilis subsp.</p>
<p>gouanii, commonly known as the Gouan's sea holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy environments.</p>
<p>The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in dunes and along the edges of salt marshes, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
