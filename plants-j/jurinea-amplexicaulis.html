                    <h1>Jurinea amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Jurinea amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping jurinea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptations, it is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
