                    <h1>Juncus petrophilus</h1>
<p>Juncus petrophilus, commonly known as the rock rush, is a perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in well-drained, often nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Juncus petrophilus is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
