                    <h1>Jatropha calcarea</h1>
<p>Jatropha calcarea, commonly known as the chalky spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Jatropha calcarea is adapted to thrive in poor, calcareous soils, which is reflected in its common name.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
