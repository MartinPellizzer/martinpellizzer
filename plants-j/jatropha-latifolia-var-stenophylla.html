                    <h1>Jatropha latifolia var. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Jatropha latifolia var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved physic nut, is a variant of the physic nut species native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, toxic berries that contain seeds used for biodiesel production. Its growth habit and morphology are similar to the typical Jatropha latifolia, but with distinct leaf narrowing.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest for its potential in renewable energy applications due to its seed oil content.</p>
