<p>Juncus fuscoater var. microcarpus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a flowering plant in the family Juncaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like clusters of brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a reddish or brownish hue, which distinguishes it from other rush species.</p>
