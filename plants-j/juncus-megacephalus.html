<p>Juncus megacephalus, commonly known as the giant rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets at the top of the stems, which contain the tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>Juncus megacephalus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
