                    <h1>Juncus intermedius</h1>
<p>Juncus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense stands, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with cylindrical, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus intermedius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support biodiversity.</p>
