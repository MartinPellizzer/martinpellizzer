<p>Juniperus squamata var. morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's juniper, is a subspecies of the juniper shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its rugged habitat. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
