                    <h1>Jatropha spinosissima</h1>
<p>Jatropha spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening despite its toxic properties.</p>
