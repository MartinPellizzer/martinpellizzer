                    <h1>Juniperus squamata var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Juniperus squamata var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its dark, woody stems. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly adapted to harsh, arid environments, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
