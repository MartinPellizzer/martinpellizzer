<p>Juncus nanus, commonly known as dwarf rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and stream banks.</p>
<p>Juncus nanus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
