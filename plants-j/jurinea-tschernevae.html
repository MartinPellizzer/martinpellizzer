                    <h1>Jurinea tschernevae</h1>
<p>Jurinea tschernevae, commonly known as the Tscherniak's sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Arctic and subarctic.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jurinea tschernevae plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
