<p>Joinvillea elegans, commonly known as the silver feather plant, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a soft, velvety texture that adds a unique visual appeal to gardens. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens.</p>
