<p>Juncus potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features tall, slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color and lack leaves, with spike-like inflorescences bearing small, greenish-white flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Juncus potaninii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
