                    <h1>Juncus nodulosus var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Juncus nodulosus var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and small, spike-like flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in cold climates make it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small alpine organisms.</p>
