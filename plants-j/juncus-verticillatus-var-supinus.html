                    <h1>Juncus verticillatus var. supinus</h1>
<p>Juncus verticillatus var. supinus, commonly known as the upright rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that grow upright, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist soils.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
