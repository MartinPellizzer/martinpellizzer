                    <h1>Juniperus ramulosa</h1>
<p>Juniperus ramulosa, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and closely packed. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its compact form and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in colder climates.</p>
<p>Juniperus ramulosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand harsh weather conditions.</p>
