<p>Jurinea woronowii, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Jurinea woronowii is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a characteristic species of dry steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
