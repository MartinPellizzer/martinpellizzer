                    <h1>Juglans regia var. laciniata</h1>
<p>Juglans regia var. laciniata, commonly known as the Persian walnut with lobed leaves, is a variant of the Persian walnut tree native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to the standard Persian walnut. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk that splits open when mature. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a cold winter dormancy period.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its nut-bearing potential.</p>
