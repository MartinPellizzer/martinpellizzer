<p>Juniperus webbii, commonly known as the Tibetan juniper, is a species of juniper native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant has scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along the branches, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Juniperus webbii is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its resilience and unique morphology make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
