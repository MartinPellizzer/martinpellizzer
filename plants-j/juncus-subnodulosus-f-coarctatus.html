<p>Juncus subnodulosus f. coarctatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its botanical features include slender stems that are often reddish in color and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
