                    <h1>Juncellus serotinus f. depauperatus</h1>
<p>Juncellus serotinus f. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse junceae, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the typical Juncellus serotinus.</p>
<p>It is a grass-like plant belonging to the Juncaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. This form is distinguished by its reduced foliage and more sparse growth compared to the typical species. It is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
