<p>Jussiaea distans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, green flowers that bloom in late summer.
