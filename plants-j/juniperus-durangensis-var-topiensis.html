                    <h1>Juniperus durangensis var. topiensis</h1>
<p>Juniperus durangensis var. topiensis, commonly known as the Topi√±o juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Durango, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its rugged habitat. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
