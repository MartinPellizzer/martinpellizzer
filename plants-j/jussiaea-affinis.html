<p>Jussiaea affinis, commonly known as the marsh willow or water willow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jussiaea affinis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and small vertebrates.</p>
