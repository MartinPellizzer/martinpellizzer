                    <h1>Juniperus himalayaensis</h1>
<p>Juniperus himalayaensis, commonly known as the Himalayan juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky and well-drained soils, and is adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and clusters of blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It is valued for its aromatic wood and is used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Juniperus himalayaensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native environment.</p>
