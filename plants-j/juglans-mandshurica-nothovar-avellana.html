                    <h1>Juglans mandshurica nothovar. avellana</h1>
<p>Juglans mandshurica nothovar. avellana, commonly known as the Manchurian walnut hybrid, is a cultivated variant resulting from crossbreeding between Juglans mandshurica and Juglans regia.</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring a robust growth habit and large, edible nuts. The plant is typically deciduous, with compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its hardiness and potential for nut production in regions where traditional walnut species may not perform well.</p>
