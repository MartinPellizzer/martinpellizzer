                    <h1>Juncus sorrentinoi var. bicephalus</h1>
<p>Juncus sorrentinoi var. bicephalus, commonly known as the two-headed rush, is a rare and unique variant of the common rush genus Juncus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-headed inflorescence, which sets it apart from other members of the genus. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its slender, grass-like stems are covered in small, spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
