<p>Juncus rohtangensis, commonly known as the Rohtang rush, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that form dense clumps, typically growing in moist, rocky soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, usually appearing in late summer. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
