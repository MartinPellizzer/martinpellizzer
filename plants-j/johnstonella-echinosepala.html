                    <h1>Johnstonella echinosepala</h1>
<p>Johnstonella echinosepala, commonly known as the spiny-sepaled Johnstonella, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring spiny sepals and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, little is known about its reproductive biology and conservation status.</p>
