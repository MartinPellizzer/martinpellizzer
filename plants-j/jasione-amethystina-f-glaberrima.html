                    <h1>Jasione amethystina f. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Jasione amethystina f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous amethyst rockrose, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, woolly foliage.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is native to specific regions in southern Europe, particularly in rocky and arid environments. The plant features small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are generally reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its unique morphological features and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
