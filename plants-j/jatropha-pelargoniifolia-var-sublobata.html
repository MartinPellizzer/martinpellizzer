<p>Jatropha pelargoniifolia var. sublobata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed cup plant, is a variant of the cup plant species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant features broad, palmately lobed leaves that are slightly narrower than those of the typical variety. Its showy, yellow-orange flowers appear in clusters and are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects.</p>
