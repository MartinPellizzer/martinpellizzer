<p>Juncus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of the plant. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette at the base. It is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other wet environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Juncus glomeratus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated conditions.</p>
