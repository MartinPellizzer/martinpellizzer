<p>Jurinea pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in the arid coastal environment.</p>
<p>Jurinea pulchella plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems.</p>
