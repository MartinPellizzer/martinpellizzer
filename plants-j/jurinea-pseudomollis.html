                    <h1>Jurinea pseudomollis</h1>
<p>Jurinea pseudomollis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, which helps it withstand strong winds and tidal action.</p>
<p>Jurinea pseudomollis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
