<p>Josephia polycephala, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent, hood-like petals that bloom in early spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources.</p>
<p>Josephia polycephala is adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
