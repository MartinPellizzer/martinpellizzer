                    <h1>Jussiaea suffruticosa var. hirta</h1>
<p>Jussiaea suffruticosa var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy willow or swamp willow, is a shrub native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist habitats.</p>
<p>Jussiaea suffruticosa var. hirta is adapted to thrive in marshy or periodically flooded areas, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
