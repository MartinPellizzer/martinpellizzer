                    <h1>Jarava breviseta</h1>
<p>Jarava breviseta, commonly known as the narrowleaf jarava, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed areas and can form dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
