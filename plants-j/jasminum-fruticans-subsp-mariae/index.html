<p>Jasminum fruticans subsp. mariae is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is known for its fragrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. This subspecies is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its unique scent has made it a favorite among botanists and perfume enthusiasts alike. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for conservation efforts.</p>
