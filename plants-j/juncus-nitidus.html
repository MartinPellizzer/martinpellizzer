                    <h1>Juncus nitidus</h1>
<p>Juncus nitidus, commonly known as the glossy rush, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tall, slender stems that are often covered with a waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>Juncus nitidus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
