                    <h1>Juglans hirsuta</h1>
<p>Juglans hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, doubly serrated leaves and stout, spiny fruit husks that encase the edible nuts. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, with separate male and female flowers on different trees. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, often with a rough, greyish texture.</p>
<p>Juglans hirsuta is valued for its hard, durable wood and its potential as a food source for wildlife.</p>
