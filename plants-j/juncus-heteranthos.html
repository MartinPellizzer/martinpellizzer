<p>Juncus heteranthos, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in basketry and thatching due to their fibrous texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus heteranthos plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
