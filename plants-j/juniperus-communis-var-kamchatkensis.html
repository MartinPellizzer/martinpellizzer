                    <h1>Juniperus communis var. kamchatkensis</h1>
<p>Juniperus communis var. kamchatkensis, commonly known as the Kamchatka juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Russian Far East and parts of Alaska.</p>
<p>It features needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitats. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience to harsh climates and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>
