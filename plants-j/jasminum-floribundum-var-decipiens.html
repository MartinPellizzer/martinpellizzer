                    <h1>Jasminum floribundum var. decipiens</h1>
<p>Jasminum floribundum var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive jasmine, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often mistaken for true jasmine due to their similar appearance. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, elliptical berries that are yellow when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its deceptive name refers to the plant's ability to mimic other jasmine species, making it difficult to identify without close examination.</p>
