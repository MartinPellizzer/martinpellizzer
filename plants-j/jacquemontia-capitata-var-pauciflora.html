<p>Jacquemontia capitata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the spiny leaf morning glory, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a concern in some ecological contexts.</p>
