                    <h1>Juncus rostocarpus</h1>
<p>Juncus rostocarpus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
