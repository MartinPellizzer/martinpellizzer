<p>Juncus articulatus subsp.</p>
<p>lampocarpus, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that are often jointed, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
