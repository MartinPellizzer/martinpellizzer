                    <h1>Juglans regia lusus laciniata</h1>
<p>Juglans regia lusus laciniata, commonly known as the Persian walnut with lobed leaves, is a variant of the Persian walnut tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to the standard Persian walnut. The plant is native to the regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It produces large, edible nuts similar to the common walnut, though its ornamental value is often more appreciated than its fruiting capacity.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates.</p>
