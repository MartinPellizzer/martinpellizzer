                    <h1>Jurinea xeranthemoides</h1>
<p>Jurinea xeranthemoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
