<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange-red, fleshy fruits containing toxic seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, handling the plant requires caution.</p>
