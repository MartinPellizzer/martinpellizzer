                    <h1>Juniperus depressa</h1>
<p>Juniperus depressa, commonly known as the low juniper, is a shrub-like evergreen conifer native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or black in color and contain toxic compounds. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
<p>Juniperus depressa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
