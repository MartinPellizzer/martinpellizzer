                    <h1>Juniperus uncinata</h1>
<p>Juniperus uncinata, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a shrub-like conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tiny, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. Juniperus uncinata is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
