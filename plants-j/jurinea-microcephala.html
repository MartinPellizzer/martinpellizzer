                    <h1>Jurinea microcephala</h1>
<p>Jurinea microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal landscaping for erosion control.</p>
