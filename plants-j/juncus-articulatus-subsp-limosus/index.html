                            <h1>Juncus Articulatus Subsp. Limosus</h1>
<p>Soft rush, scientifically known as Juncus articulatus subsp. limosus, is a common wetland plant found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the upper stems in late spring or early summer. Despite its modest appearance, soft rush plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its adaptability to waterlogged conditions makes it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
