                    <h1>Jurinea monocephala</h1>
<p>Jurinea monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Jurinea monocephala is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in areas with limited rainfall and high solar exposure.</p>
