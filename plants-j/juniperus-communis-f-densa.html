<p>Juniperus communis f. densa, commonly known as the dense juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that forms a spherical or conical shape, providing a dense canopy. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its aromatic leaves release a fragrant resin, which contributes to its use in landscaping and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cold climates.</p>
