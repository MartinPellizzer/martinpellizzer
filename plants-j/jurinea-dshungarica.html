                    <h1>Jurinea dshungarica</h1>
<p>Jurinea dshungarica, commonly known as the Mongolian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. It has adapted to extreme conditions with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Jurinea dshungarica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological restoration projects.</p>
