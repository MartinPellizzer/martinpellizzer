<p>Juncus ramboi subsp.</p>
<p>colombianus, commonly known as the Colombian rush, is a member of the Juncaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical stems. It is native to South America, particularly Colombia, where it thrives in wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in moist soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
