<p>Jupunba oxyphyllidia, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Teloschistaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces such as stones and soil. The plant exhibits a pale green to yellowish coloration, with distinct lobes and a finely branched structure. It is capable of surviving in nutrient-poor conditions due to its symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi.</p>
<p>Jupunba oxyphyllidia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem.</p>
