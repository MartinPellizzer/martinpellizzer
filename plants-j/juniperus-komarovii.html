<p>Juniperus komarovii, commonly known as the Chinese juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to China and parts of Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in dense, flat sprays.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Juniperus komarovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardy, drought-tolerant nature.</p>
