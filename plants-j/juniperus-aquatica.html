                    <h1>Juniperus aquatica</h1>
<p>Juniperus aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic juniper, is a rare and unique plant species adapted to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in moist conditions. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Juniperus aquatica is often found in shallow water or along the edges of lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
