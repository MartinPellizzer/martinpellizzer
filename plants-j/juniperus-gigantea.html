                    <h1>Juniperus gigantea</h1>
<p>Juniperus gigantea, commonly known as the giant juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus gigantea thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a notable component of arid and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
