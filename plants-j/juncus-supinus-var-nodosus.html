                    <h1>Juncus supinus var. nodosus</h1>
<p>Juncus supinus var. nodosus, commonly known as the nodding rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The nodding appearance of its flowers is a distinguishing feature, giving it a delicate, grass-like appearance.</p>
