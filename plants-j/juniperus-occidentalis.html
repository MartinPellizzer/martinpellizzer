                    <h1>Juniperus occidentalis</h1>
<p>Juniperus occidentalis, commonly known as western juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color and arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands.</p>
<p>The wood of western juniper is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, making it useful in construction and as a source of juniper berries for culinary and medicinal purposes.</p>
