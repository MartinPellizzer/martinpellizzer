                    <h1>Juncus alpinus f. uniceps</h1>
<p>Juncus alpinus f. uniceps, commonly known as the single-stemmed alpine rush, is a botanical variant of the alpine rush species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. Its compact growth habit and dark green, cylindrical stems make it a striking addition to alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique genetic trait of producing a single stem per plant, distinguishing it from the typical branching form of its species.</p>
