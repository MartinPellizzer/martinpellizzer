                    <h1>Juniperus virginiana var. barbadensis</h1>
<p>Juniperus virginiana var. barbadensis, commonly known as the Florida juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Its aromatic foliage and resilience to salt spray make it a valuable component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other juniper species but is distinguished by its unique geographic distribution and ecological niche.</p>
