<p>Jurinea sintenisii subsp.</p>
<p>orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert margins and steppe habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
