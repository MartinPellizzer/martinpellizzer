                    <h1>Jurinea macrocephala</h1>
<p>Jurinea macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Jurinea macrocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
