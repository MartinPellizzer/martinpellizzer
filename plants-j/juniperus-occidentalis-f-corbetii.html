                    <h1>Juniperus occidentalis f. corbetii</h1>
<p>Juniperus occidentalis f. corbetii, commonly known as the Corbetâ€™s juniper, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like form and its blue-green foliage, which contrasts with the more common gray-green coloration of other juniper species. The plant produces small, dark-blue to black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
