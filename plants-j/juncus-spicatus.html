                    <h1>Juncus spicatus</h1>
<p>Juncus spicatus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Juncus spicatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
