                    <h1>Juncus ponticus</h1>
<p>Juncus ponticus, commonly known as the Pontic rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Juncus ponticus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in fluctuating water conditions.</p>
