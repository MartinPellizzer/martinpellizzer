<p>Juncus acutiflorus var. pratensis, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color and covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to moist soils and can thrive in areas with standing water or saturated ground.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
