                    <h1>Jarava plumosa</h1>
<p>Jarava plumosa, commonly known as the silky jarava, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
