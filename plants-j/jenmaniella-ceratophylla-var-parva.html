                    <h1>Jenmaniella ceratophylla var. parva</h1>
<p>Jenmaniella ceratophylla var. parva, commonly known as the small horned fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble small horns. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, glossy leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
