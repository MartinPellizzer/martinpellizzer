<p>Jatropha palmatipartita, commonly known as the broad-leaved jatropha, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds covered in a sticky, milky sap.</p>
<p>This sap contains toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful to animals and humans if ingested.</p>
