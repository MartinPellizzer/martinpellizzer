                    <h1>Juniperus horizontalis subsp. hamptonensis</h1>
<p>Juniperus horizontalis subsp.</p>
<p>hamptonensis, commonly known as the Hampton juniper, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its reddish-brown stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion.</p>
