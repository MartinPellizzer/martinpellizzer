                    <h1>Juttadinteria tugwelliae</h1>
<p>Juttadinteria tugwelliae, commonly known as the Tugwell's ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptation to extreme conditions, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
