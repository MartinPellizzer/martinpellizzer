                    <h1>Juncus conglomeratus var. ingens</h1>
<p>Juncus conglomeratus var. ingens, commonly known as the giant rush, is a tall, perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, such as marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its long, sturdy appearance.</p>
