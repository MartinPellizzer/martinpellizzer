                    <h1>Juniperus procumbens</h1>
<p>Juniperus procumbens, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, spherical blue or black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Juniperus procumbens is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
