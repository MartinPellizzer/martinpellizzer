<p>Juncus striatus var. prolifer, commonly known as the spreading rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, it is an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
