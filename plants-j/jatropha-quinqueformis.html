<p>Jatropha quinqueformis, commonly known as the five-lobed spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring rough, ridged bark and dark green, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy berries containing toxic seeds. It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap and various medicinal uses in traditional practices.</p>
<p>However, the plant is also considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
