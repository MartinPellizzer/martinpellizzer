<p>Juncus subcuneatus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, forming dense mats near water sources. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
