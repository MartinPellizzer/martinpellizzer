                    <h1>Juncus lampocarpus var. viviparus</h1>
<p>Juncus lampocarpus var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is notable for its viviparous trait, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and ecological restoration projects.</p>
