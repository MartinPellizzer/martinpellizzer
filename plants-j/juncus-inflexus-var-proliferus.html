                    <h1>Juncus inflexus var. proliferus</h1>
<p>Juncus inflexus var. proliferus, commonly known as the spreading rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green and cylindrical in shape. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more extensive branching and dense growth habit compared to other juncus species.</p>
