<p>Juncus radula, commonly known as the slender rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Juncaceae family and typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Juncus radula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
