                    <h1>Juncus striatus</h1>
<p>Juncus striatus, commonly known as the striped rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and other moist soils, forming dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus striatus is also an important food source for various insects and birds.</p>
