                    <h1>Jurinea algida</h1>
<p>Jurinea algida, commonly known as the cold sea sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments such as coastal sands and rocky shores, where it adapts to extreme cold and strong winds. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss and withstand freezing temperatures. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, appearing in early summer when the environment is most hospitable.</p>
<p>Jurinea algida plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
