                    <h1>Juniperus microphylla</h1>
<p>Juniperus microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus microphylla is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation in arid environments.</p>
