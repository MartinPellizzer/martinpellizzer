                    <h1>Jatropha acrandra</h1>
<p>Jatropha acrandra, commonly known as the largeleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties.</p>
