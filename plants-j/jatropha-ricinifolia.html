                    <h1>Jatropha ricinifolia</h1>
<p>Jatropha ricinifolia, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into toxic, orange-red berries. The plant contains ricin, a potent toxin found in its seeds, making it highly dangerous if ingested. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Jatropha ricinifolia is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in tropical ecosystems.</p>
