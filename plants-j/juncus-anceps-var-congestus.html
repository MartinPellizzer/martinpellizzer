                    <h1>Juncus anceps var. congestus</h1>
<p>Juncus anceps var. congestus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, forming a compact clump. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
