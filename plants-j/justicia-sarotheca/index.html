                            <h1>Justicia Sarotheca</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Justicia sarotheca, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. With its delicate, blue-violet blooms that appear in late summer, it adds a soft, ethereal touch to gardens and natural landscapes. This herbaceous perennial thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for many garden settings. Its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees make it a valuable addition to ecological gardens. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more showy flowers, yet it holds a special place in both horticulture and the natural world.</p>
