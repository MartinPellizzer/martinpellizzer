                    <h1>Juncus conglomeratus var. laxus</h1>
<p>Juncus conglomeratus var. laxus, commonly known as the loose tussock rush, is a flowering plant in the Juncaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form tussocks, typically growing in wet or marshy habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It is often found in temperate regions, particularly in areas with moist soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more loosely packed foliage compared to other forms of Juncus conglomeratus.</p>
