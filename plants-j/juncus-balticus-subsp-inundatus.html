<p>Juncus balticus subsp.</p>
<p>inundatus, commonly known as the Baltic rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous small, spike-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with moderate to high water levels. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic and semi-aquatic settings.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
