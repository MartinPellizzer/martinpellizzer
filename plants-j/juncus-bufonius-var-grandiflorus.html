                    <h1>Juncus bufonius var. grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Juncus bufonius var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers at the top of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands in moist soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
