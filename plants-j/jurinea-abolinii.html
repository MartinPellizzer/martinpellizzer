<p>Jurinea abolinii, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, adapted to survive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jurinea abolinii is often found in dunes and other dry, disturbed habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
