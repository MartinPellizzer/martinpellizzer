<p>Juncus subulatus var. depauperatus, commonly known as the slender spike rush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense arrangement along its stem. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
