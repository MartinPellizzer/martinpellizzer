<p>Jussiaea sagrana, commonly known as the sacred waterplant, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers. The plant has long, slender leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Jussiaea sagrana is also sometimes used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
