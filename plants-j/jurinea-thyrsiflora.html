                    <h1>Jurinea thyrsiflora</h1>
<p>Jurinea thyrsiflora, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, silver-gray leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters called thyrses, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppes and desert margins.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in harsh climates.</p>
