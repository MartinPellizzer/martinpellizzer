<p>Juncus fauriensis var. kamschatcensis, commonly known as the Kamchatka rush, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and coastal areas. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in tidal zones.</p>
