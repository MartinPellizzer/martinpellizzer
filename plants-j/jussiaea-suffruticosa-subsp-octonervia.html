<p>Jussiaea suffruticosa subsp.</p>
<p>octonervia, commonly known as the eight-veined jussiaea, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, opposite leaves with eight distinct veins.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
