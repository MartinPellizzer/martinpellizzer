                    <h1>Jumellea lignosa var. ferkoana</h1>
<p>Jumellea lignosa var. ferkoana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features woody stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
