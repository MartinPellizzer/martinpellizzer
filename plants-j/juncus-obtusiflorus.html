                    <h1>Juncus obtusiflorus</h1>
<p>Juncus obtusiflorus, commonly known as the broadflower rush, is a perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features dense clusters of grass-like, narrow leaves and produces small, pale green to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Juncus obtusiflorus is also an important food source for various pollinators and aquatic wildlife.</p>
