<p>Juncus triglumis var. schischkinii, commonly known as the Schischkin's rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish flowers in early summer. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
