<p>Janusia, commonly known as the "dwarf ironwood," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of only one species, Janusia glabrata, which is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Janusia is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber.</p>
