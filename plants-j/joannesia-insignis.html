                    <h1>Joannesia insignis</h1>
<p>Joannesia insignis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and long, narrow leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its dense, hard wood, it has been heavily exploited for furniture and musical instruments, leading to its endangered status.</p>
