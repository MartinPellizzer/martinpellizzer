                    <h1>Jatropha albomaculata var. stimulosissima</h1>
<p>Jatropha albomaculata var. stimulosissima, commonly known as the stimulant jatropha, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which can release a milky latex when damaged. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, three-lobed capsules containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its potential in biofuel production due to its high oil content in the seeds.</p>
