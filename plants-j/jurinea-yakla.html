                    <h1>Jurinea yakla</h1>
<p>Jurinea yakla, commonly known as the Tibetan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia, including Tibet and Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial plant with a compact rosette of fleshy, grayish-green leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Jurinea yakla is often found in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
