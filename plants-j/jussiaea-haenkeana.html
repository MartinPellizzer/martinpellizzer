                    <h1>Jussiaea haenkeana</h1>
<p>Jussiaea haenkeana, commonly known as the marsh willow or water willow, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems that often grow in dense clusters near water bodies. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jussiaea haenkeana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds.</p>
