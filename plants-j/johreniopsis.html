                    <h1>Johreniopsis</h1>
<p>Johreniopsis, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its globular shape and spiny exterior. The plant features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Johreniopsis produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
