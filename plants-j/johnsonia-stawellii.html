<p>Johnsonia stawellii, commonly known as the Stawell Johnsonia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the arid regions of South Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-adapted to its harsh environment. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Johnsonia stawellii plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, supporting local insect populations and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
