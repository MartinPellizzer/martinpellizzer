                    <h1>Jasione perennis proles pygmaea</h1>
<p>Jasione perennis proles pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf everlasting or small everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with thin, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Its name reflects its diminutive size and its ability to retain its color and form even after drying, hence its historical use in floral arrangements.</p>
