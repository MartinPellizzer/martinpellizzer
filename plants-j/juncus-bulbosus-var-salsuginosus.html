                    <h1>Juncus bulbosus var. salsuginosus</h1>
<p>Juncus bulbosus var. salsuginosus, commonly known as the salt marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, saline soils along shorelines and estuaries, exhibiting a robust, grass-like appearance with cylindrical, hollow stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal zones.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to high salinity and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
