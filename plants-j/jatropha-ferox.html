                    <h1>Jatropha ferox</h1>
<p>Jatropha ferox, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often thorny stems and dark green, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits containing toxic seeds. Its sap and all parts of the plant contain irritants and toxins, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution.</p>
