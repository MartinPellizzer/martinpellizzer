<p>Justicia venalis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf false arum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Justicia venalis is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
