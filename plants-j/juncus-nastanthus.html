<p>Juncus nastanthus, commonly known as the redstem bulrush, is a perennial plant native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Juncus nastanthus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
