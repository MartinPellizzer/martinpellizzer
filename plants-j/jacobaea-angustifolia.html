                    <h1>Jacobaea angustifolia</h1>
<p>Jacobaea angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a powdery coating. Jacobaea angustifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
