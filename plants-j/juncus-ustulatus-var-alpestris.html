<p>Juncus ustulatus var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense tufts, often forming mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
