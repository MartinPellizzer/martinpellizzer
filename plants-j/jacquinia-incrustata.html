                    <h1>Jacquinia incrustata</h1>
<p>Jacquinia incrustata, commonly known as the rock spirea, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest.</p>
