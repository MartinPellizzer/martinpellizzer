<p>Jacobaea divaricata, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.
