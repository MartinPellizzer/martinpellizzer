                    <h1>Juncus nodosus var. genuinus</h1>
<p>Juncus nodosus var. genuinus, commonly known as the nodding rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces tall, slender flowering spikes that bear small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective pioneer species in restoring degraded wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The variety *genuinus* is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical *Juncus nodosus*.</p>
