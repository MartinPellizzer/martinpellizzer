                    <h1>Johnsonia acaulis var. drummondii</h1>
<p>Johnsonia acaulis var. drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's rockrose, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps minimize water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
