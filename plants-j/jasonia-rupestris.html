                    <h1>Jasonia rupestris</h1>
<p>Jasonia rupestris, commonly known as the rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in spring. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Jasonia rupestris is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
