<p>Juncus conglomeratus var. umbrosus, commonly known as the shadow rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets at the tips of its stems, which are usually brown or reddish-brown in hue. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp areas with partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective stabilizer of soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
