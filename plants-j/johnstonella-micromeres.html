                    <h1>Johnstonella micromeres</h1>
<p>Johnstonella micromeres, commonly known as the small-celled Johnstonella, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its compact, dense growth habit.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is distinguished by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Johnstonella micromeres is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unusual morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
