                    <h1>Jarava chrysophylla var. crispula</h1>
<p>Jarava chrysophylla var. crispula, commonly known as the crinkled golden grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, golden-yellow inflorescences that are both attractive and functional for pollination. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>
