<p>Juncus striatus var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to erosion control in aquatic habitats.</p>
