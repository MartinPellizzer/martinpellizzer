                    <h1>Jasonia glutinosa var. antiatlantica</h1>
<p>Jasonia glutinosa var. antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic gluescale, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, resinous leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
