<p>Juglans nigra, commonly known as black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, ridged bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces clusters of green, spherical fruits called drupes, which mature to a dark brown color. Its seeds, enclosed in a hard, toxic husk, are a valuable food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>Black walnut is also valued for its strong, durable wood and has historical uses in medicine and dye production.</p>
