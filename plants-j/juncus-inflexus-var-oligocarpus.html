                    <h1>Juncus inflexus var. oligocarpus</h1>
<p>Juncus inflexus var. oligocarpus, commonly known as the few-fruited rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its flowers are usually wind-pollinated, a common trait among members of the Juncaceae family.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced number of fruits compared to other varieties of Juncus inflexus.</p>
