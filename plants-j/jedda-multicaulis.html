<p>Jedda multicaulis, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Jedda multicaulis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
