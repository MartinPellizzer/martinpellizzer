<p>Juncus gerardi var. soranthus, commonly known as the red stemmed bulrush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, contributing to wetland health.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its reddish stem color, which sets it apart from other juncus species.</p>
