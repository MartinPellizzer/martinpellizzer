                    <h1>Juniperus excelsa var. seravschanica</h1>
<p>Juniperus excelsa var. seravschanica, commonly known as the Pamir juniper, is a rare and hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, blue-gray berries that mature in the second year. The plant thrives in cold, dry climates and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it well-suited for harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to extreme conditions.</p>
