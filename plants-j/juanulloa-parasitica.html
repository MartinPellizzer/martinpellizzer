                    <h1>Juanulloa parasitica</h1>
<p>Juanulloa parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily in the genus *Piper*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or green berries that are dispersed by birds and other animals. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract resources.</p>
<p>Juanulloa parasitica is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense forest understories.</p>
