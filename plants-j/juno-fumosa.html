                    <h1>Juno fumosa</h1>
<p>Juno fumosa, commonly known as the smoky juniper, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, blue-gray berries that are often used in traditional medicine by Indigenous peoples. Its leaves are scale-like and tightly packed, reducing water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Juno fumosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
