<p>Jurinea dobrogensis, commonly known as the Dobrogian sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in dry, sandy soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in a dense, compact inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss, reflecting its arid environment.</p>
<p>Jurinea dobrogensis is characterized by its resilience to harsh conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
