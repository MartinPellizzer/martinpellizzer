                    <h1>Javieria xerophylla</h1>
<p>Javieria xerophylla, commonly known as the desert feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit that helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Javieria xerophylla is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
