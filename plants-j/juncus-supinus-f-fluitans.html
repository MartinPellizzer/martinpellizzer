                    <h1>Juncus supinus f. fluitans</h1>
<p>Juncus supinus f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits unique aquatic adaptations.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that float on the water's surface, allowing it to thrive in wetland and marsh environments. The plant's stems are typically submerged or partially submerged, facilitating nutrient absorption from the water. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters that emerge from the water surface.</p>
<p>This form is often found in shallow, still waters and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
