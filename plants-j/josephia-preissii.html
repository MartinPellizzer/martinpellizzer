                    <h1>Josephia preissii</h1>
<p>Josephia preissii, commonly known as the Karoo starfish, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with its succulent leaves and deep root system. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Josephia preissii is considered vulnerable and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
