                    <h1>Juncus supinus var. nanus</h1>
<p>Juncus supinus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf basket sedge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Juncaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the standard Juncus supinus, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces.</p>
