                    <h1>Juniperus caesia</h1>
<p>Juniperus caesia, commonly known as the silver juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which gives it a striking appearance in both natural and cultivated landscapes. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or black in color and are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Juniperus caesia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
