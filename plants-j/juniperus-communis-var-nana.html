                    <h1>Juniperus communis var. nana</h1>
<p>Juniperus communis var. nana, commonly known as dwarf juniper, is a compact, slow-growing shrub native to northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of less than 1 meter, featuring dense, scale-like leaves that are blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is highly adaptable, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and as a ground cover in colder climates.</p>
