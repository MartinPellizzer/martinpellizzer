<p>Juncus stygius subsp.</p>
<p>americanus, commonly known as the American rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered spikelets of brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The American rush is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and biodiversity.</p>
