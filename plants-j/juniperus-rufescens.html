                    <h1>Juniperus rufescens</h1>
<p>Juniperus rufescens, commonly known as the red juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and scale-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus rufescens is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and resilience make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
