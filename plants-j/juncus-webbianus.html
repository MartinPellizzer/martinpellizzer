<p>Juncus webbianus, commonly known as the webb's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus webbianus plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
