<p>Jussiaea villosissima, commonly known as the silky water plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and float on the water surface, while its roots hang below, absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Jussiaea villosissima is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
