<p>Josephia floribunda, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Josephia floribunda is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
