                    <h1>Juncus fasciculatus</h1>
<p>Juncus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are usually found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Juncus fasciculatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
