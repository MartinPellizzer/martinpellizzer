The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arising from a basal rosette, and are adapted for water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland wildlife.</p>
