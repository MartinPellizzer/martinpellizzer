                    <h1>Juniperus gossainthanea</h1>
<p>Juniperus gossainthanea, commonly known as the Gossainthan Hills juniper, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Himalayan region of India.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Juniperus gossainthanea is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
