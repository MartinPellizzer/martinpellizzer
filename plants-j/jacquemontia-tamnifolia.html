<p>Jacquemontia tamnifolia, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright red or orange. The plant blooms in the early morning, hence its common name, and has a climbing habit with tendrils that help it ascend support structures. Its flowers are pollinated by birds and insects, and the plant is adapted to moist, sunny habitats.</p>
