<p>Jaramilloa sanctae-martae, commonly known as the Santa Marta jaramilloa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with prominent yellow stamens. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
