<p>Juniperus virginica, commonly known as the eastern red cedar, is a dioecious evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climates, and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
