                    <h1>Juncus amplifolius var. pumilus</h1>
<p>Juncus amplifolius var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more compact compared to other junctus species. The plant produces small, clustered brownish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms. It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
