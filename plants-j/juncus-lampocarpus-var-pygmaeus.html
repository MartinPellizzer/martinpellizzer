                    <h1>Juncus lampocarpus var. pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Juncus lampocarpus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of California.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters tall. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often obscured by the foliage, making it difficult to distinguish from other rush species. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, tolerating both fresh and saltwater conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize shorelines and provide habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
