<p>Juncus geniculatus subsp.</p>
<p>arthrophyllus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color, which contain the flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
