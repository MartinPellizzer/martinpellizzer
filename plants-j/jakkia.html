<p>Jakkia, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Indian subcontinent and thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its stinging hairs, similar to those of other nettles, can cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>Jakkia is often found in forests and along stream banks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
