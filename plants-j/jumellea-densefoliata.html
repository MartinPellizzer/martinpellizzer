<p>Jumellea densefoliata, commonly known as the dense-leaved jumellea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jumellea densefoliata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
