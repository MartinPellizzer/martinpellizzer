                    <h1>Jubaea spectabilis</h1>
<p>Jubaea spectabilis, commonly known as the golden cup palm, is a rare and striking member of the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the island of Socotra, it is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow inflorescences that contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant has a solitary trunk with a crown of pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a branched structure, and it produces edible fruits that are about the size of a small apple.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jubaea spectabilis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
