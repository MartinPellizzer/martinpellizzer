                    <h1>Juncus bufonius var. congestus</h1>
<p>Juncus bufonius var. congestus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in riparian zones, swamps, and other moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, it is an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
