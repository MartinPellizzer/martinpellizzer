                    <h1>Juncus atropurpureus</h1>
<p>Juncus atropurpureus, commonly known as the purple rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that are often tinged with purple, especially at the base, and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
