                    <h1>Juniperus squamata var. loderi</h1>
<p>Juniperus squamata var. loderi, commonly known as the Loder's juniper, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scaly foliage that forms a spherical or conical shape, with small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tiny, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
