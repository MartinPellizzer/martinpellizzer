                    <h1>Jurinea argentata</h1>
<p>Jurinea argentata, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert margins and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Jurinea argentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
