                    <h1>Juncus flavidus</h1>
<p>Juncus flavidus, commonly known as the yellow rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically reddish-brown to yellowish in color, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetlands.</p>
<p>Juncus flavidus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
