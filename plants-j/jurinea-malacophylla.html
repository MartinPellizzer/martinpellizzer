                    <h1>Jurinea malacophylla</h1>
<p>Jurinea malacophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are succulent and covered in fine, silky hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Jurinea malacophylla is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
