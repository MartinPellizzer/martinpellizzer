                    <h1>Juncus bryoides</h1>
<p>Juncus bryoides, commonly known as the mossy rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, moss-like coating. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>Juncus bryoides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
