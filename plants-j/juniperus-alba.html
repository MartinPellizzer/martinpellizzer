                    <h1>Juniperus alba</h1>
<p>Juniperus alba, commonly known as the white juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the stems. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus alba is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates.</p>
<p>It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in difficult growing conditions.</p>
