<p>Jussiaea natans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, bladder-like structures that help it stay afloat on the water's surface. The plant has tiny, thread-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge above the water. It is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Jussiaea natans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
