                    <h1>Jurinea atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Jurinea atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Jurinea atropurpurea is often found in steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
