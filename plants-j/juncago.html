                    <h1>Juncago</h1>
<p>Juncago, commonly known as the spike rush, is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like clusters of narrow, cylindrical leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along stream banks or in swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the tips of its stems, which are usually green or reddish in color. Juncago species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and adaptability make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
