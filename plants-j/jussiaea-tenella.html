<p>Jussiaea tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf waterplantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Jussiaea tenella plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
