                    <h1>Jeffreya palustris</h1>
<p>Jeffreya palustris, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jeffreya palustris plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems.</p>
