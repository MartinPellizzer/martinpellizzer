<p>Juncus paniculatus subsp.</p>
<p>depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse bulrush, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers. It is typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in saturated soils.</p>
