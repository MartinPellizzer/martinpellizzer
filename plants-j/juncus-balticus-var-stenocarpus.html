                    <h1>Juncus balticus var. stenocarpus</h1>
<p>Juncus balticus var. stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-carpel rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of this variety make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and ecological restoration projects.</p>
