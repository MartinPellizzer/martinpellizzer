                    <h1>Juncus digitatus</h1>
<p>Juncus digitatus, commonly known as the tufted rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Juncus digitatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
