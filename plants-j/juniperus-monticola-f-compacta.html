                    <h1>Juniperus monticola f. compacta</h1>
<p>Juniperus monticola f. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, needle-like foliage that is typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its rugged habitat. The plant produces small, blue or black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating poor soil and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
