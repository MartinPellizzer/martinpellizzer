<p>Juncus balticus var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are clustered at the tips of its stems. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slender, more delicate foliage compared to other varieties of Juncus balticus.</p>
