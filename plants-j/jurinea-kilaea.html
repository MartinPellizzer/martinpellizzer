<p>Jurinea kilaea, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid and coastal regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found along dunes and coastal plains. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Jurinea kilaea is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
