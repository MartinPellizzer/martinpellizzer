<p>Jatropha laciniosa, commonly known as the laceleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges.</p>
<p>Jatropha laciniosa is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
