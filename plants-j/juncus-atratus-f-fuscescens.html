<p>Juncus atratus f. fuscescens, commonly known as the dark rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark brown to blackish stems, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical green stems of other juncus species. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
