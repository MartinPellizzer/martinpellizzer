<p>Jussiaea miquelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that grow submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it thrives in marshy areas and shallow waters.</p>
<p>Jussiaea miquelii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical study remains limited compared to more widely researched aquatic plants.</p>
