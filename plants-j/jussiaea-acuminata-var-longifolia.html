                    <h1>Jussiaea acuminata var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Jussiaea acuminata var. longifolia, commonly known as the slender water-plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects its adaptation to waterlogged soils, with a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in muddy substrates.</p>
