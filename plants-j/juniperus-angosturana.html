                    <h1>Juniperus angosturana</h1>
<p>Juniperus angosturana, commonly known as the Angostura juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high elevations, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. The plant has scale-like leaves that are closely appressed to the branches, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its role in traditional medicine among indigenous communities.</p>
