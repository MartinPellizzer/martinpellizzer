The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that provide a delicate contrast to its vibrant blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialty gardens.</p>
