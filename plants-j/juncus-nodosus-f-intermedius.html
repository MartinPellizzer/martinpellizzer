<p>Juncus nodosus f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate nodding rush, is a variant of the nodding rush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in other moist soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowering stems often nod or droop, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
