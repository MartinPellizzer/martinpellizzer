<p>Justicia campylostemon, commonly known as red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright spikes of bright red bracts that resemble poker chips, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting bees and other pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and long blooming period from summer to fall add vibrant color to landscapes.</p>
