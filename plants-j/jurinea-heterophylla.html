                    <h1>Jurinea heterophylla</h1>
<p>Jurinea heterophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is often used in xeriscaping and coastal restoration projects.</p>
