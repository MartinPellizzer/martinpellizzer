                    <h1>Juniperus sheppardii f. albonotata</h1>
<p>Juniperus sheppardii f. albonotata, commonly known as the white-furred juniper, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the sheppardii juniper.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white, foliage that contrasts with the typical green of other juniper varieties. This subspecies is native to the arid regions of western North America, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a notable subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
