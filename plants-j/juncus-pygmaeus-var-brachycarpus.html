                    <h1>Juncus pygmaeus var. brachycarpus</h1>
<p>Juncus pygmaeus var. brachycarpus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a low-growing mat, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ability to stabilize soil make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
