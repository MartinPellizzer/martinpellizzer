<p>Juncus fontanesii subsp.</p>
<p>brachyanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The subspecies brachyanthus is distinguished by its shorter, more condensed flowering structure compared to other members of the species.</p>
