                    <h1>Juncus alpinus f. obtusatus</h1>
<p>Juncus alpinus f. obtusatus, commonly known as the blunt-leaved alpine rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter and more rounded at the tips compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, contributing to its subtle appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens and as a hardy, low-maintenance plant for alpine collections.</p>
