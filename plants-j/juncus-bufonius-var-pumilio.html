<p>Juncus bufonius var. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and pond edges. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Juncus bufonius, with a more compact growth habit.</p>
