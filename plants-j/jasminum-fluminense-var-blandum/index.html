<p>Fluminense jasmine, scientifically known as Jasminum fluminense var. blandum, is a fragrant flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is prized for its delicate white blooms and sweet, intoxicating aroma that fills the air during the warmer months. This variety of jasmine is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ornamental value. Its leaves are glossy and evergreen, providing year-round visual appeal. Despite its beauty, it requires well-drained soil and protection from extreme weather to thrive.</p>
