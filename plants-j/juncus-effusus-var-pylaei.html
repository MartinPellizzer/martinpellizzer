                    <h1>Juncus effusus var. pylaei</h1>
<p>Juncus effusus var. pylaei, commonly known as the Pylaean rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color, growing up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland wildlife.</p>
