                            <h1>Jurinea Mollis</h1>
<p>Jurinea mollis is a hardy flowering plant known for its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments. It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores of the North Atlantic. This species is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and tough, woolly leaves that help it withstand strong winds and salt spray. Its resilience makes it an important part of coastal ecosystems. Despite its modest appearance, Jurinea mollis plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife.</p>
