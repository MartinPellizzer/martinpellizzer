                            <h1>Jacea × Thaiszii</h1>
<p>Jacea × thaiszii is a unique hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Jacea indica and Jacea asiatica. It is commonly known as the Thai jasmine or sometimes referred to as the Thai night-blooming flower. This plant is native to Southeast Asia and is prized for its fragrant white flowers that bloom at night. Its delicate appearance and pleasant aroma make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and indoor cultivation. Despite its beauty, Jacea × thaiszii is relatively rare and requires specific care to thrive.</p>
