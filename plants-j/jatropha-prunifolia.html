<p>Jatropha prunifolia, commonly known as the redroot jatropha, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange roots and its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is generally avoided as a food source and is more commonly found in wild or cultivated landscapes.</p>
