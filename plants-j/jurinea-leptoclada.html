                    <h1>Jurinea leptoclada</h1>
<p>Jurinea leptoclada, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, linear leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Jurinea leptoclada plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat.</p>
