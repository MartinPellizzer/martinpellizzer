                    <h1>Juncus echinocephalus</h1>
<p>Juncus echinocephalus, commonly known as the spiny-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus echinocephalus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
