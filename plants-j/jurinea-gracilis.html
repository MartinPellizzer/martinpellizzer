<p>Jurinea gracilis, commonly known as the slender sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jurinea gracilis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
