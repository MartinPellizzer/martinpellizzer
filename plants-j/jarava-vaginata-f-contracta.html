                    <h1>Jarava vaginata f. contracta</h1>
<p>Jarava vaginata f. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved jarava, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rolled in the bud. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its low water requirements, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
