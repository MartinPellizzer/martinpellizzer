                    <h1>Jambosa ramosissima</h1>
<p>Jambosa ramosissima, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, branched foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
