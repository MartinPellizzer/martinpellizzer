                    <h1>Jonesiopsis dundasiae</h1>
<p>Jonesiopsis dundasiae, commonly known as the Dundas's Jonesiopsis, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
