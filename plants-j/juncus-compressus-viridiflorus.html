<p>Juncus compressus viridiflorus, commonly known as the greenflower rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
