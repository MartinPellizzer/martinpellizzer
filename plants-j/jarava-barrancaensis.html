                    <h1>Jarava barrancaensis</h1>
<p>Jarava barrancaensis, commonly known as the canyon jarava, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and along canyon walls, where it thrives in full sun and low moisture conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Jarava barrancaensis is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
