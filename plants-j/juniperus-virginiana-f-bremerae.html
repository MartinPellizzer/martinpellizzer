                    <h1>Juniperus virginiana f. bremerae</h1>
<p>Juniperus virginiana f. bremerae, commonly known as the Bremer's red cedar, is a rare and distinctive form of the Eastern red cedar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open woodland habitats.</p>
<p>This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
