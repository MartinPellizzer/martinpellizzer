                    <h1>Jurinea aggregata</h1>
<p>Jurinea aggregata, commonly known as the clustered sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Jurinea aggregata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats.</p>
