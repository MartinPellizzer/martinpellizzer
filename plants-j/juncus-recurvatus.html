                    <h1>Juncus recurvatus</h1>
<p>Juncus recurvatus, commonly known as the recurved rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and cylindrical. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, often in late spring or early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in moist soils.</p>
<p>Juncus recurvatus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
