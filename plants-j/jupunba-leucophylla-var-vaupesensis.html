<p>Jupunba leucophylla var. vaupesensis, commonly known as the Vaup√©s jupunba, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Amazon rainforest of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight, a feature that helps it thrive in the dense, humid environment. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its showy, five-petaled flowers. It typically grows in swampy areas and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
