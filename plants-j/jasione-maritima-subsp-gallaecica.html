<p>Jasione maritima subsp.</p>
<p>gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician sea bell, is a flowering plant native to the western coasts of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in coastal environments, often found on sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant features slender stems and small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution along the Atlantic coast.</p>
