                    <h1>Jalambicea repens</h1>
<p>Jalambicea repens, commonly known as the creeping jalambicea, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in traditional medicine and has adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
