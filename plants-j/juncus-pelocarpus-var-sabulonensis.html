                    <h1>Juncus pelocarpus var. sabulonensis</h1>
<p>Juncus pelocarpus var. sabulonensis, commonly known as the sand junco, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments or along shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
