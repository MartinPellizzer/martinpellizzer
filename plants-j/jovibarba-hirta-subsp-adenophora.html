<p>Jovibarba hirta subsp.</p>
<p>adenophora, commonly known as the hairy cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, hairy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine white hairs that help reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
