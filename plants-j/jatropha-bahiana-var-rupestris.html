<p>Jatropha bahiana var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock jatropha, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits are capsules that contain toxic seeds, a common trait among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Jatropha bahiana var. rupestris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
