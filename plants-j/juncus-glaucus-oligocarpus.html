<p>Juncus glaucus oligocarpus, commonly known as the blue rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact tufts, often growing in moist soils along stream banks and marshes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus glaucus oligocarpus is valued for its ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
