<p>Juncus alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>carpaticus, commonly known as the Carpathian rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spike-like clusters. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate snow cover during winter.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland and mountainous environments.</p>
