                    <h1>Jatropha nogalensis</h1>
<p>Jatropha nogalensis, commonly known as the Mexican physic nut, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, alternate leaves, and small, greenish flowers that develop into spiny capsules. It produces toxic seeds that contain a milky latex, which can be harmful if ingested.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, Jatropha nogalensis has been studied for its potential in biofuel production due to its high oil content.</p>
