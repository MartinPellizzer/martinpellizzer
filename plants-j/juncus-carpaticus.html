                    <h1>Juncus carpaticus</h1>
<p>Juncus carpaticus, commonly known as the Carpathian rush, is a perennial plant native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which helps prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Juncus carpaticus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small vertebrates.</p>
