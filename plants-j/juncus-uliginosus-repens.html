                    <h1>Juncus uliginosus repens</h1>
<p>Juncus uliginosus repens, commonly known as the creeping marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It forms dense mats of grass-like foliage with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
