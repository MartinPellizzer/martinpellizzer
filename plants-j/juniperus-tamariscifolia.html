<p>Juniperus tamariscifolia, commonly known as the desert juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries that are typically retained on the plant for several years. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable component of desert ecosystems.</p>
