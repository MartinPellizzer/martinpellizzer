                    <h1>Juncus supinus var. repens</h1>
<p>Juncus supinus var. repens, commonly known as the creeping rush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the tips of its stems, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
