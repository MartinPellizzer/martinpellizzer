                    <h1>Jarava pachypus</h1>
<p>Jarava pachypus, commonly known as the narrowleaf jarava, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive and helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Jarava pachypus is often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
