                    <h1>Juniperus pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Juniperus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a pyramidal shape. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Juniperus pyramidalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat in arid landscapes.</p>
