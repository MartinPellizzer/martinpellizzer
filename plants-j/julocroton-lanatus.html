                    <h1>Julocroton lanatus</h1>
<p>Julocroton lanatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in terminal panicles, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. Julocroton lanatus is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>Its hairy foliage and rapid growth make it both a common weed and a plant of interest in ecological studies.</p>
