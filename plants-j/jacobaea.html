                    <h1>Jacobaea</h1>
<p>Jacobaea, commonly known as ragwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect stems, alternate leaves, and clusters of yellow to orange flowers. Many species are toxic to livestock, particularly cattle, due to the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands.</p>
<p>Some species are considered invasive in certain regions, impacting native plant communities.</p>
