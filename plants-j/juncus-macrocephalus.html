<p>Juncus macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically unbranched and covered in stiff, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus macrocephalus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds.</p>
