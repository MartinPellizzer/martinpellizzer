                    <h1>Jurinea sosnowskyi</h1>
<p>Jurinea sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's ice plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in alpine and arctic tundra, where it tolerates extreme temperatures and strong winds. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor and arid conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically yellow or white, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat.</p>
