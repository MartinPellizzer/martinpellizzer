                    <h1>Jarava humilis</h1>
<p>Jarava humilis, commonly known as the dwarf jarava, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with slender, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with poor soil, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system. Its fine, silky foliage makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Jarava humilis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
