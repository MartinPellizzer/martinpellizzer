                    <h1>Juncus alpinus pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Juncus alpinus pygmaeus, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ability to withstand harsh conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>
