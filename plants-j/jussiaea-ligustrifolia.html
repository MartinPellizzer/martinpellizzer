<p>Jussiaea ligustrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and marshes. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jussiaea ligustrifolia plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
