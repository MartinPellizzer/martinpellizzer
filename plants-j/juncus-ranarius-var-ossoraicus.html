<p>Juncus ranarius var. ossoraicus, commonly known as the Ossoraic rush, is a perennial plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are usually greenish or brown in color.
