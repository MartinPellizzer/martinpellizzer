<p>Juncus heptopotamicus, commonly known as the Seven Rivers rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of the seven river valleys in southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of green or brown. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near freshwater sources.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
