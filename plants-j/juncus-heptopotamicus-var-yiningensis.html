                    <h1>Juncus heptopotamicus var. yiningensis</h1>
<p>Juncus heptopotamicus var. yiningensis, commonly known as the Yining rush, is a perennial plant native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
