                    <h1>Juncus effusus pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Juncus effusus pauciflorus, commonly known as the slender rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like, cylindrical leaves and is native to wetland habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its limited flowering, as suggested by its specific epithet, makes it less showy compared to other rush species.</p>
