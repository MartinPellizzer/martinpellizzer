<p>Juncus alpinoarticulatus subsp.</p>
<p>atricapillus, commonly known as the black-tipped rush, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its dark purple or black-tipped flowers distinguish it from other rush species.</p>
<p>The subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment.</p>
