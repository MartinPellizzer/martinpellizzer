<p>Julbernardia paniculata, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its valuable timber and ecological importance, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
