                    <h1>Jurinea dumulosa</h1>
<p>Jurinea dumulosa, commonly known as the snowbed bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white, which help attract pollinators in its harsh habitat. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and protect against extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Jurinea dumulosa plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its fragile ecosystems and is an indicator species of high-altitude environments.</p>
