                    <h1>Juncus alpinus var. carpaticus</h1>
<p>Juncus alpinus var. carpaticus, commonly known as the Carpathian rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
