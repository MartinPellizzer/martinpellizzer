<p>Jatropha lobata subsp.</p>
<p>glauca, commonly known as the blue jatropha, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and hairy, glandular leaves.</p>
<p>The plant is typically shrub-like, with stout stems and often grows in dry, rocky habitats. It produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, a common trait among the genus Jatropha.</p>
<p>The subspecies glauca is distinguished by its glaucous (bluish-gray) appearance, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
