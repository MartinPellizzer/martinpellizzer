                    <h1>Juglans laciniosa</h1>
<p>Juglans laciniosa, commonly known as the Mexican walnut, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by oval, green fruits that mature into dark brown nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its bark is thick and fissured, often with a reddish-brown color, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its edible nuts, though it is less commonly cultivated than other walnut species.</p>
