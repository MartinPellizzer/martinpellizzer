<p>Juncus aquaticus subsp.</p>
<p>fuscoater, commonly known as the dark-stemmed rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually dark brown to black in color, which distinguish it from other rush species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or reddish flowers.</p>
