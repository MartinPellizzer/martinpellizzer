<p>Juncus inaequalis var. genuinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
