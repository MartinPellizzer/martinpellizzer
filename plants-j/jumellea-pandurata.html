<p>Jumellea pandurata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-like growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Jumellea pandurata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
