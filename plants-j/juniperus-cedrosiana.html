                    <h1>Juniperus cedrosiana</h1>
<p>Juniperus cedrosiana, commonly known as Cedros Island juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to the Channel Islands of California.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for wildlife. It is adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its native range, showing resilience to drought and salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
