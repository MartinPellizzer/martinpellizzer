<p>Juncus crassiculmis, commonly known as broad-leaved rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and somewhat broad at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually borne on slender, flowering stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus crassiculmis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
