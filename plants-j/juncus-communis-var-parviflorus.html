                    <h1>Juncus communis var. parviflorus</h1>
<p>Juncus communis var. parviflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender cylindrical stems that are typically unbranched and covered in a layer of fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
