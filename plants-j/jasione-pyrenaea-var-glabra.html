<p>Jasione pyrenaea var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rock-jasmine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabra is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
