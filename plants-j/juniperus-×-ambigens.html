<p>Juniperus × ambigens, commonly known as the hybrid juniper, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Juniperus scopulorum and Juniperus horizontalis, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color and shed seasonally.
