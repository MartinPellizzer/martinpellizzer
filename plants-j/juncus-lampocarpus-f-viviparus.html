                    <h1>Juncus lampocarpus f. viviparus</h1>
<p>Juncus lampocarpus f. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous rush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. One notable feature is its viviparous nature, where the plant produces viable seeds while still attached to the mother plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows for rapid propagation in disturbed or saline environments.</p>
