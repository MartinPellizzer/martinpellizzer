                    <h1>Juncus sphagnetorum</h1>
<p>Juncus sphagnetorum, commonly known as the bog rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs and marshes. The plant has tall, slender, grass-like stems that are typically green or reddish in color. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its moist environment.</p>
