<p>Juglans × intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid walnut, is a cross between the black walnut (Juglans nigra) and the English walnut (Juglans regia).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, featuring compound leaves with 15–23 leaflets. The tree produces green, spherical fruits that mature to a dark green or brown color, encased in a thick, spiky husk. Its nuts are generally smaller than those of the English walnut but are prized for their flavor and oil content.</p>
<p>The plant is native to the United States and is cultivated for both ornamental and commercial purposes.</p>
