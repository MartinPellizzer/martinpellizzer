                    <h1>Juncus articulatus var. setiformis</h1>
<p>Juncus articulatus var. setiformis, commonly known as the silky rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has jointed stems, a feature typical of the Juncaceae family, which allows it to bend without breaking. Its feathery appearance and ability to tolerate water make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually greenish or brownish and are followed by small, three-lobed berries that disperse via wind or water.</p>
