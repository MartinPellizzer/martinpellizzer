                            <h1>Jansenella Griffithiana</h1>
<p>Griffith's jansenella, scientifically known as Jansenella griffithiana, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan. This species belongs to the family Apiaceae, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Despite its beauty, Jansenella griffithiana is highly endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection for ornamental purposes. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique plant and preserve its ecological role in its native environment. Its survival is a testament to the fragile balance of biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
