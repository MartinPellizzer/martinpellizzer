<p>Johnsonia acaulis, commonly known as the naked stem Johnsonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often hairy stems that lack leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Johnsonia acaulis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
