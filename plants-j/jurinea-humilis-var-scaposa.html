                    <h1>Jurinea humilis var. scaposa</h1>
<p>Jurinea humilis var. scaposa, commonly known as the scapose sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or desert environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
