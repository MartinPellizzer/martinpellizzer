                    <h1>Jurinea bracteata</h1>
<p>Jurinea bracteata, commonly known as the bracted jurinea, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
