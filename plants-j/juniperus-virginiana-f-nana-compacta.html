<p>Juniperus virginiana f. nana-compacta, commonly known as the dwarf Atlantic juniper, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, scale-like foliage that is typically a deep green, providing a dense cover that helps prevent erosion on sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and hardy nature make it a valuable plant for stabilizing dunes and coastal landscapes.</p>
