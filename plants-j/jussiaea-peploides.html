<p>Jussiaea peploides, commonly known as the silky willow or marsh willow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often匍匐的 stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a soft appearance.</p>
<p>Jussiaea peploides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shoreline vegetation and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
