                    <h1>Juniperus formosa</h1>
<p>Juniperus formosa, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus formosa is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions.</p>
