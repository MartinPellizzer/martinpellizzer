                    <h1>Juniperus media</h1>
<p>Juniperus media, commonly known as the common juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and its clustered, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant produces aromatic wood that has been historically used for construction and as a source of turpentine. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates allows it to thrive in a range of environments, from coastal areas to mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Juniperus media plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
