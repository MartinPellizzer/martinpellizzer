<p>Jryaghedi, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer, creating a vibrant display against the dry landscape. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Jryaghedi produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
