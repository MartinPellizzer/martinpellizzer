                    <h1>Jurinea tortumensis</h1>
<p>Jurinea tortumensis, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jurinea tortumensis plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
