<p>Juncus tommasinii, commonly known as the Tommasini rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in well-drained soils, often in rocky or sandy habitats, and is adapted to low moisture conditions. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often branched near the base, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually green or brown in color.</p>
<p>Juncus tommasinii is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
