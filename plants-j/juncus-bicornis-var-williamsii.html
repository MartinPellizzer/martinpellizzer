                    <h1>Juncus bicornis var. williamsii</h1>
<p>Juncus bicornis var. williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' rush, is a variant of the broadleaf rush native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
