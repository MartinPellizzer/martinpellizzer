This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its growth habit is low and compact, making it well-suited to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
