<p>Jatropha carpinifolia, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture and a distinct, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Jatropha carpinifolia is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient species in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
