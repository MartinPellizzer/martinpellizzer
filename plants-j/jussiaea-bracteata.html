<p>Jussiaea bracteata, commonly known as the marsh mallow or slender marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing stems and hairy, ovate leaves that help reduce water loss in its moist environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their mucilage content, which has soothing properties.</p>
<p>Jussiaea bracteata thrives in marshy areas and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants.</p>
