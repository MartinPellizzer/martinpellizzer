                    <h1>Jirasekia tenella</h1>
<p>Jirasekia tenella, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Jirasekia tenella is an epiphytic plant, often growing on the surfaces of other aquatic plants or submerged vegetation.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted for a carnivorous lifestyle, allowing it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
