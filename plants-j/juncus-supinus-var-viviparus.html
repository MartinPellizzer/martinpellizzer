                    <h1>Juncus supinus var. viviparus</h1>
<p>Juncus supinus var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where buds form at the base of the stems and can root and grow independently. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other juncus species but is distinguished by its unique reproductive strategy.</p>
