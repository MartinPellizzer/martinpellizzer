                    <h1>Juniperus hemisphaerica</h1>
<p>Juniperus hemisphaerica, commonly known as the spherical juniper, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth form, with tightly packed, scale-like leaves that give it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and can thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Juniperus hemisphaerica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
