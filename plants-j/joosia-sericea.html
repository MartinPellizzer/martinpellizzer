<p>Joosia sericea, commonly known as silverleaf joosia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Joosia sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
