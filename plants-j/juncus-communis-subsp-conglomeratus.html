<p>Juncus communis subsp.</p>
<p>conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous base.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat, it is valued in ecological restoration projects.</p>
