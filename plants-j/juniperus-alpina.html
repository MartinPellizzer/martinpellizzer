                    <h1>Juniperus alpina</h1>
<p>Juniperus alpina, commonly known as the alpine juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, and it produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus alpina is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh conditions with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
