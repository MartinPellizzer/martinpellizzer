<p>Jussiaea multinervia, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, with prominent veins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically emerging from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Jussiaea multinervia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
