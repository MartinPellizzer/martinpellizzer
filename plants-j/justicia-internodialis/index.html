                            <h1>Justicia Internodialis</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Justicia internodialis, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its delicate, sky-blue flowers that appear in dense clusters, creating a mist-like effect that gives it its common name. This perennial plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its vibrant blooms attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. With its unique appearance and ecological benefits, Blue mistflower is both an ornamental and an important species in its natural habitat.</p>
