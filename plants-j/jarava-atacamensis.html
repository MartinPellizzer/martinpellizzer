                    <h1>Jarava atacamensis</h1>
<p>Jarava atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama jarava, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its harsh environment.</p>
