<p>Jarava vatroensis, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, which are usually pale green or brown.</p>
<p>Jarava vatroensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
