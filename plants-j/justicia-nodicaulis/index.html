<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Justicia nodicaulis, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. This perennial shrub is celebrated for its delicate, bluish-white flowers that appear in clusters, creating a mist-like appearance that gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. With its unique foliage and long blooming period, it is a favorite among gardeners and nature enthusiasts. The plant's ability to attract pollinators makes it an important component of local ecosystems.</p>
