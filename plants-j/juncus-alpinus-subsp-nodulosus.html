<p>Juncus alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>nodulosus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are often nodular, giving it its subspecies name, and it is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
