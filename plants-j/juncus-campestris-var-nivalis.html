<p>Juncus campestris var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like as well. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
