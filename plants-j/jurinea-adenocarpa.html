<p>Jurinea adenocarpa, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a succulent, cushion-like structure that helps it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Jurinea adenocarpa is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive in extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
