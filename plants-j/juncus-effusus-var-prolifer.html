<p>Juncus effusus var. prolifer, commonly known as the soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and damp woodlands.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and ability to colonize disturbed soils make it an important pioneer species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
