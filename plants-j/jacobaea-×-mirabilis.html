                    <h1>Jacobaea × mirabilis</h1>
<p>Jacobaea × mirabilis, commonly known as the gloriosa starflower, is a hybrid perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
