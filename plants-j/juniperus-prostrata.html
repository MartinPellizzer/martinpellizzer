                    <h1>Juniperus prostrata</h1>
<p>Juniperus prostrata, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or low bushes, with scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Juniperus prostrata is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in rocky or arid environments.</p>
