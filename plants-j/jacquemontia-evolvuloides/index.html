                            <h1>Jacquemontia Evolvuloides</h1>
<p>Prairie morning glory, scientifically known as Jacquemontia evolvuloides, is a striking member of the Convolvulaceae family native to the central United States. This annual vine is recognized for its vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, giving it its common name. It thrives in prairie habitats, often found along roadsides and in disturbed soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant's rapid growth and unique flowering pattern make it a notable wildflower in native plant communities. Despite its beauty, it is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit.</p>
