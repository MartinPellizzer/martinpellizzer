<p>Juncus capensis var. flaccidus, commonly known as the soft rush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically green or pale brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and flat, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its often humid habitat.</p>
