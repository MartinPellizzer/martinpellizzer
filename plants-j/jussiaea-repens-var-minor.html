                    <h1>Jussiaea repens var. minor</h1>
<p>Jussiaea repens var. minor, commonly known as the creeping jussiaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptical, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
