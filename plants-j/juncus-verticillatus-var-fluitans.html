                    <h1>Juncus verticillatus var. fluitans</h1>
<p>Juncus verticillatus var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits aquatic adaptations.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clustered, cylindrical stems that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in water. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ability to stabilize water bodies and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
