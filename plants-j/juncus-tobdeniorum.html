<p>Juncus tobdeniorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often crowded together, forming dense clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, clustered flower spikes in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Juncus tobdeniorum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
