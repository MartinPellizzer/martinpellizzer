                            <h1>Justicia Corumbensis</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Justicia corumbensis, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its delicate, blue-gray foliage and its clusters of small, mist-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This hardy plant thrives in partial to full sun and is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes. With its elegant form and low maintenance requirements, it is a valuable addition to native plant collections.</p>
