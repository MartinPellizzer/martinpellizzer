                    <h1>Juncus inflexus subvar. laxiflorus</h1>
<p>Juncus inflexus subvar. laxiflorus, commonly known as the looseflower rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and the flowers are arranged in spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subvariety is distinguished by its more loosely spaced flowers compared to other varieties of Juncus inflexus.</p>
