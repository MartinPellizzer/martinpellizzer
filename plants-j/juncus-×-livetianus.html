                    <h1>Juncus × livetianus</h1>
<p>Juncus × livetianus, commonly known as the silver rush, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Juncus effusus and Juncus roemerianus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in silvery-white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and tidal flats, where it thrives in brackish or freshwater conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the top of the stems.</p>
<p>Juncus × livetianus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
