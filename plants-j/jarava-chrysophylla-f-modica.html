                    <h1>Jarava chrysophylla f. modica</h1>
<p>Jarava chrysophylla f. modica, commonly known as the Modica form of the golden leaf jarava, is a rare botanical variant native to specific regions of southern Italy.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, upright growth and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
