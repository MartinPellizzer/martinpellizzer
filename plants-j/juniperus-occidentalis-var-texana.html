<p>Juniperus occidentalis var. texana, commonly known as the Texas juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The Texas juniper is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh conditions.</p>
