<p>Jussiaea junghuhniana, commonly known as the slender water-plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Jussiaea junghuhniana plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
