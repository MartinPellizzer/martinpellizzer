                    <h1>Juncus alpinus var. insignis</h1>
<p>Juncus alpinus var. insignis, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique morphology, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
