                    <h1>Juniperus talassica</h1>
<p>Juniperus talassica, commonly known as the coastal juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, blue-black berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and habitat creation.</p>
<p>Juniperus talassica plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining coastal biodiversity.</p>
