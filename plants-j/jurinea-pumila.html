<p>Jurinea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sea bladder, is a low-growing, mat-forming flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Arctic and Antarctic.</p>
<p>It is adapted to harsh environments, with small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in intertidal zones.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology allows it to survive in extreme cold and salt exposure.</p>
