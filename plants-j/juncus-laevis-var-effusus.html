                    <h1>Juncus laevis var. effusus</h1>
<p>Juncus laevis var. effusus, commonly known as the soft rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments across much of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems that are typically smooth and slightly hairy, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in stabilizing aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
