                    <h1>Juncago maritima</h1>
<p>Juncago maritima, commonly known as sea rush, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Sea rush thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal marshes and along shores.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
