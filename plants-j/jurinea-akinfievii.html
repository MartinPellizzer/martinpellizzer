<p>Jurinea akinfievii, commonly known as the Akinfeiev's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, saline environments, often growing in coastal dunes or salt marshes. Its narrow, succulent leaves help reduce water loss, while its compact growth form aids in withstanding strong winds.</p>
<p>Jurinea akinfievii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest to botanists studying halophytic plants.</p>
