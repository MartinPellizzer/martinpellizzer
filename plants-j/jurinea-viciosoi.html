                    <h1>Jurinea viciosoi</h1>
<p>Jurinea viciosoi, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure, which helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Jurinea viciosoi plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
