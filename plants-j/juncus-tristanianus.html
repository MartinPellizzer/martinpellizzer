                    <h1>Juncus tristanianus</h1>
<p>Juncus tristanianus, commonly known as the Tristan juncus, is a perennial plant native to the subantarctic region of the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a low-growing rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
