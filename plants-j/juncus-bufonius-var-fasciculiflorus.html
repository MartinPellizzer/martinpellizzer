<p>Juncus bufonius var. fasciculiflorus, commonly known as the clustered flower rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that grow from 1 to 3 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a tight rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
