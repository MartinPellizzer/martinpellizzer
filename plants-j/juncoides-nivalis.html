                    <h1>Juncoides nivalis</h1>
<p>Juncoides nivalis, commonly known as the snow rush, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its cold tolerance, Juncoides nivalis is an indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
