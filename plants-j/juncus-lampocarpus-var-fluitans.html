                    <h1>Juncus lampocarpus var. fluitans</h1>
<p>Juncus lampocarpus var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating rush, is a variant of the rush plant native to coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often forming mats on the surface of brackish or saline water. The plant typically has white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to its habitat. It thrives in wetland environments, including salt marshes and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
