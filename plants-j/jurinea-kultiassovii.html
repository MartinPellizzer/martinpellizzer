<p>Jurinea kultiassovii, commonly known as the Kultiassov's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, featuring silver-gray foliage that reduces water loss through transpiration. Its flowers, which are typically blue or purple, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
