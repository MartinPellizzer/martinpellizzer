<p>Juncus cephalostigma, commonly known as the crowned rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils along stream banks and in shallow water. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered at the top.</p>
<p>Juncus cephalostigma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
