                    <h1>Juncus polycephalos</h1>
<p>Juncus polycephalos, commonly known as the many-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers at the top of the stems, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in marshy environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Juncus polycephalos is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
