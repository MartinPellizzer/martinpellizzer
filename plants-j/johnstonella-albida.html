                    <h1>Johnstonella albida</h1>
<p>Johnstonella albida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, white, ghost-like appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, delicate leaves and produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Johnstonella albida is highly threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
