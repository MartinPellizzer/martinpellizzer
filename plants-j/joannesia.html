                    <h1>Joannesia</h1>
<p>Joannesia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of a single species, Joannesia procumbens, which is native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, broad ovate leaves, and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Joannesia is notable for its hard, dense wood, which has historically been valued for use in musical instruments and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered.</p>
