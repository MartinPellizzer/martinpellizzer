                    <h1>Jovetia humilis var. glabra</h1>
<p>Jovetia humilis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth jovetia, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
