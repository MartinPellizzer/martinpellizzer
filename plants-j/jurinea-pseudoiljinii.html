<p>Jurinea pseudoiljinii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Jurinea pseudoiljinii is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
