                    <h1>Juncus consanguineus</h1>
<p>Juncus consanguineus, commonly known as the redstem bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Juncus consanguineus is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions.</p>
