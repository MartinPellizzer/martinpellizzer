<p>Juncus compressus f. euxinus, commonly known as the Crimean rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as riverbanks and coastal areas, where it thrives in moist, saline conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its compact growth habit and adaptation to saline environments.</p>
