<p>Jovibarba globifera subsp.</p>
<p>allionii, commonly known as the Allion's cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white wool.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers on short stalks during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
