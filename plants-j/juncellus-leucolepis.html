<p>Juncellus leucolepis, commonly known as the white-leaved rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn.</p>
