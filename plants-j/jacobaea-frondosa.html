<p>Jacobaea frondosa, commonly known as the fronded ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of broadly lanceolate leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow flowers in a terminal cluster. Its leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jacobaea frondosa is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species.</p>
