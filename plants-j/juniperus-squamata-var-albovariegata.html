The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple in color, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and cold hardiness, it is often used as a decorative plant in temperate climates.</p>
