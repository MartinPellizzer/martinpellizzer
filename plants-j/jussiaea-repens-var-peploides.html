                    <h1>Jussiaea repens var. peploides</h1>
<p>Jussiaea repens var. peploides, commonly known as the creeping jussiaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in coastal and freshwater wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
