                    <h1>Jacquemontia evolvuloides f. microphylla</h1>
<p>Jacquemontia evolvuloides f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf heliotrope, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter, giving it its distinguishing "dwarf" characteristic. The plant produces clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that resemble those of the common heliotrope, though smaller in size. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique and ornamental addition to gardens, particularly in warm climates.</p>
