<p>Juncus apiculatus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with tall, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers at the top of the stems, which are usually green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Juncus apiculatus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
