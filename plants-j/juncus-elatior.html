<p>Juncus elatior, commonly known as tall rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Juncus elatior is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
