<p>Jacea emporitana, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique and rare tree species native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and its long, narrow, scale-like leaves. The plant belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is known for its slow growth and longevity, with some trees living over 1,000 years. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and thick, waxy bark that helps it survive in the arid climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Jacea emporitana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
