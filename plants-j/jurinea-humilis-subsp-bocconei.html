<p>Jurinea humilis subsp.</p>
<p>bocconei, commonly known as the Boccone's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dry, disturbed areas.</p>
