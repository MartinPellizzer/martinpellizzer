                    <h1>Jurinea thianschanica</h1>
<p>Jurinea thianschanica, commonly known as the Tian Shan sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly the Tian Shan mountain range.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has adapted to harsh, dry environments with a deep root system and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Jurinea thianschanica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest for its ecological resilience in extreme climates.</p>
