<p>Juncus articulatus subsp.</p>
<p>striatus, commonly known as the striped rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, ditches, and the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often striped with distinct longitudinal markings. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
