<p>Jatropha loureiroi, commonly known as the Brazilian physic nut, is a shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow flowers.

It is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions, making it a hardy species.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes.</p>
