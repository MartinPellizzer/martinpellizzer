                    <h1>Justicia spartioides</h1>
<p>Justicia spartioides, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It has a fibrous root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and restoration projects in dry landscapes.</p>
