                    <h1>Juniperus chinensis f. glauca</h1>
<p>Juniperus chinensis f. glauca, commonly known as the Blue Atlas Cedar, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountains of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, blue-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, especially in winter when the leaves are more pronounced. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple in color, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Due to its cold hardiness, it is also suitable for colder climates, though it may require protection in extremely harsh conditions.</p>
