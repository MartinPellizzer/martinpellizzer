                    <h1>Jarandersonia</h1>
<p>Jarandersonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Jarandersonia is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
