                    <h1>Jurinea subacaulis</h1>
<p>Jurinea subacaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea-blite, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands, aiding in its adaptation to harsh coastal conditions. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Jurinea subacaulis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion.</p>
