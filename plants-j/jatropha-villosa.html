<p>Jatropha villosa, commonly known as the hairy physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Jatropha villosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, arid environments.</p>
<p>It is sometimes cultivated for its potential in biofuel production due to its oil-rich seeds.</p>
