                    <h1>Juniperus flagelliformis</h1>
<p>Juniperus flagelliformis, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a shrub-like evergreen conifer native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit with flexible, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple in color and serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Juniperus flagelliformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native range.</p>
