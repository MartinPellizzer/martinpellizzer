                    <h1>Juncus togakushiensis var. viviparus</h1>
<p>Juncus togakushiensis var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous rush, is a rare and specialized plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Juncaginaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive strategy, where the inflorescences produce live seeds that can germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
