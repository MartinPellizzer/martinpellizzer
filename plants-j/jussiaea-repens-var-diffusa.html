                    <h1>Jussiaea repens var. diffusa</h1>
<p>Jussiaea repens var. diffusa, commonly known as the creeping jussiaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
