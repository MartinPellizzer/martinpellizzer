                    <h1>Juniperus cerrosianus</h1>
<p>Juniperus cerrosianus, commonly known as the mountain juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss in its dry habitat. Its cones, which are small and berry-like, contain the aromatic seeds that are used in various traditional and commercial applications.</p>
<p>The plant's resilience and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important component of its ecosystem.</p>
