                    <h1>Justicia palustris var. dispersa</h1>
<p>Justicia palustris var. dispersa, commonly known as the swamp verbena, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats along the waterâ€™s edge. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability.</p>
