                    <h1>Jurinea ceratocarpa var. depressa</h1>
<p>Jurinea ceratocarpa var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwrack, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in intertidal zones. The plant features small, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which aid in gas exchange and buoyancy. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Chenopodiaceae family, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits.</p>
