                    <h1>Juniperus monticola subsp. compacta</h1>
<p>Juniperus monticola subsp.</p>
<p>compacta, commonly known as the dwarf mountain juniper, is a compact, shrub-like evergreen conifer native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its rugged mountain habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions, with a slow growth rate and deep root system that helps it survive in poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems and a popular ornamental plant in colder climates.</p>
