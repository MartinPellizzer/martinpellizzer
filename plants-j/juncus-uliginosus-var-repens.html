                    <h1>Juncus uliginosus var. repens</h1>
<p>Juncus uliginosus var. repens, commonly known as the creeping marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and cylindrical, typically growing in dense clumps. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to saturated soils, often found in bogs, fens, and marshes.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its spreading growth habit, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
