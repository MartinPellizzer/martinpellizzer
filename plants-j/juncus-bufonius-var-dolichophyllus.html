                    <h1>Juncus bufonius var. dolichophyllus</h1>
<p>Juncus bufonius var. dolichophyllus, commonly known as the long-leaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with a fibrous root system adapted for waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown, and it blooms in late summer to early fall. It thrives in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
