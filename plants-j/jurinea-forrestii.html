                    <h1>Jurinea forrestii</h1>
<p>Jurinea forrestii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and northern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Jurinea forrestii is well adapted to cold, dry conditions and is often found growing on rocky slopes and sandy soils.</p>
