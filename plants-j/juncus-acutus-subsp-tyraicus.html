<p>Juncus acutus subsp.</p>
<p>tyraicus, commonly known as the slender rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
