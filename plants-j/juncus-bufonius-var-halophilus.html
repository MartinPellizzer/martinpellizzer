                    <h1>Juncus bufonius var. halophilus</h1>
<p>Juncus bufonius var. halophilus, commonly known as salt marsh rush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and estuaries where soil salinity is high. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variant is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines.</p>
