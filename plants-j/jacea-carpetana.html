<p>Jacea carpetana, commonly known as the mountain gentian, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jacea carpetana plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
