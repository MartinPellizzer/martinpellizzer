                    <h1>Juncus repens</h1>
<p>Juncus repens, commonly known as the creeping rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that grows in clusters. The plant typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Juncus repens thrives in saturated soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
