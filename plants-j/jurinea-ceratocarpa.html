<p>Jurinea ceratocarpa, commonly known as the horned sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to harsh desert environments. The plant features small, pale green leaves and produces delicate, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is often used in xerophytic landscaping and conservation efforts in dryland ecosystems.</p>
