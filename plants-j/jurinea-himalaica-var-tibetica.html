                    <h1>Jurinea himalaica var. tibetica</h1>
<p>Jurinea himalaica var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rocky slopes and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the short growing season of its habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
