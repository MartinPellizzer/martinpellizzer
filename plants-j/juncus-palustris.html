                    <h1>Juncus palustris</h1>
<p>Juncus palustris, commonly known as soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments across North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in moist habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions.</p>
