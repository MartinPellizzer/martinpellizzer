                    <h1>Juglans mandshurica f. coarctata</h1>
<p>Juglans mandshurica f. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved black walnut, is a botanical variant of the black walnut species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and smaller, more compact fruits compared to the typical black walnut. The plant produces hard, thick-shelled nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its timber and has limited cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
