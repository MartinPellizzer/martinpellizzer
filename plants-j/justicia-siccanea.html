                    <h1>Justicia siccanea</h1>
<p>Justicia siccanea, commonly known as the desert false arum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts and small white flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh, desert environment.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and dry gardens.</p>
