                    <h1>Juniperus microsperma</h1>
<p>Juniperus microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus microsperma is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
