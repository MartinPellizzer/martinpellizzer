                    <h1>Juniperus communis var. sibirica</h1>
<p>Juniperus communis var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the colder regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in boreal and alpine environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, providing efficient photosynthesis in harsh climates. Its male and female cones are separate, with the female cones developing into blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to thrive in extreme conditions.</p>
