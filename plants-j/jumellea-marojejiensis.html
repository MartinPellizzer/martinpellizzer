<p>Jumellea marojejiensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive star-shaped appearance with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, white flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Jumellea marojejiensis is a rare species, highlighting the rich biodiversity of Madagascar's unique ecosystems.</p>
