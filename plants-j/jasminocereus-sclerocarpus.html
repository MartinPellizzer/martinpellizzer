<p>Jasminocereus sclerocarpus, commonly known as the desert night-blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habit, with large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant has a globular or cylindrical shape, often with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a deep root system and a slow growth rate.</p>
