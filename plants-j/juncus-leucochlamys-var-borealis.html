                    <h1>Juncus leucochlamys var. borealis</h1>
<p>Juncus leucochlamys var. borealis, commonly known as the northern marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and streams, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish or purple in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
