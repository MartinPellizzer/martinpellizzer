<p>Jurinea muliensis, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Jurinea muliensis is adapted to survive in harsh, cold, and windy conditions typical of its alpine habitat.</p>
