                    <h1>Juncus nodosus</h1>
<p>Juncus nodosus, commonly known as the knotted rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, often reddish-brown stems that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Juncus nodosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
