                    <h1>Juniperus pachyphlaea f. ericoides</h1>
<p>Juniperus pachyphlaea f. ericoides, commonly known as the Ericoid Juniper, is a shrub-like form of the broader Juniperus pachyphlaea species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that resemble those of ericaceous plants, hence its common name. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically retained on the plant for extended periods. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>This form is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
