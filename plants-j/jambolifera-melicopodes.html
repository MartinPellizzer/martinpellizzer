                    <h1>Jambolifera melicopodes</h1>
<p>Jambolifera melicopodes, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of northern Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small figs. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to drought and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils.</p>
