                    <h1>Juncus subcuneatus var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Juncus subcuneatus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are broader than those of the typical Juncus subcuneatus. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
