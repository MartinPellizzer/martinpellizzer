<p>Juncus articulatus f. macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits distinct botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and covered with a waxy cuticle. The plant produces large, elongated spikelets that contain numerous small, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to waterlogged conditions, with a robust root system and a rapid growth rate.</p>
