<p>Jasione crispa subsp.</p>
<p>serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentine jasione, is a flowering plant native to rocky, nutrient-poor soils of the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white.</p>
<p>The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves adapted to harsh, dry environments. It thrives in serpentine soils, which are rich in magnesium and poor in calcium, making it a rare example of a plant specialized to such conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
