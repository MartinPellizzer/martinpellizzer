                    <h1>Jurinea mariae</h1>
<p>Jurinea mariae, commonly known as the maritime sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Jurinea mariae plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
