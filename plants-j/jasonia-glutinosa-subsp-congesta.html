<p>Jasonia glutinosa subsp.</p>
<p>congesta, commonly known as the sticky jasonia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which is a notable botanical feature.</p>

<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
