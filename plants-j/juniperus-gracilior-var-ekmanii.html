                    <h1>Juniperus gracilior var. ekmanii</h1>
<p>Juniperus gracilior var. ekmanii, commonly known as the slender juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring compact, needle-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its neat form and winter interest, though it is not commonly cultivated in North America.</p>
