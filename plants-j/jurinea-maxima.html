                    <h1>Jurinea maxima</h1>
<p>Jurinea maxima, commonly known as the giant sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jurinea maxima is often found in dunes and along the edges of the sea, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
