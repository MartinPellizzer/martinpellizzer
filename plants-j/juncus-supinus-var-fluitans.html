                    <h1>Juncus supinus var. fluitans</h1>
<p>Juncus supinus var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits unique adaptations for aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wet meadows. Its stems are often buoyant, allowing the plant to float on the water's surface, which facilitates light absorption and gas exchange. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
