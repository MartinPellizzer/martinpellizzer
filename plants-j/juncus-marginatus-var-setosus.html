<p>Juncus marginatus var. setosus, commonly known as the hairy rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
