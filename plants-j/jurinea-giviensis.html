                    <h1>Jurinea giviensis</h1>
<p>Jurinea giviensis, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Jurinea giviensis is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
