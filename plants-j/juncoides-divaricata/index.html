<p>Variegated rush, scientifically known as Juncoides divaricata, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. Its unique appearance features grass-like leaves with striking white and green variegation, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking visual interest. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. It is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Despite its beauty, it requires careful attention to water levels and soil conditions to flourish.</p>
