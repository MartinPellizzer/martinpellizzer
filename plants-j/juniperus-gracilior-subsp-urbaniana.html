                    <h1>Juniperus gracilior subsp. urbaniana</h1>
<p>Juniperus gracilior subsp.</p>
<p>urbaniana, commonly known as the slender juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species in temperate regions.</p>
<p>The subspecies urbaniana is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and growth form compared to other juniper species.</p>
