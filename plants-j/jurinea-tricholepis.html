                    <h1>Jurinea tricholepis</h1>
<p>Jurinea tricholepis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt-laden winds and coastal conditions. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Jurinea tricholepis is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate harsh, coastal climates.</p>
