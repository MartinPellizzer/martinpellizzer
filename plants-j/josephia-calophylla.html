                    <h1>Josephia calophylla</h1>
<p>Josephia calophylla, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Josephia calophylla is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
