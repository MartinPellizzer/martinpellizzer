                    <h1>Juncus rochelianus var. digeneus</h1>
<p>Juncus rochelianus var. digeneus, commonly known as the Rochel's rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, often forming dense stands along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter and more compact growth compared to other members of the Juncus genus.</p>
