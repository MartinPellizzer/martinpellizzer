<p>Juno issica, commonly known as the silverleaf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically a bluish-gray color, providing a striking visual contrast to its rugged habitat. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
