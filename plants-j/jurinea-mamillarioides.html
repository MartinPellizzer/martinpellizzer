<p>It is native to coastal areas of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny stems, which help it retain water in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a succulent in gardens and rockeries.</p>
