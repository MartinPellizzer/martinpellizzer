<p>Juncus polytrichos, commonly known as the hairy rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Juncus polytrichos plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
