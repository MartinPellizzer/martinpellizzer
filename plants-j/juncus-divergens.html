                    <h1>Juncus divergens</h1>
<p>Juncus divergens, commonly known as the broadleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has grass-like leaves that are flat and broad, with a fibrous texture, and produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Juncus divergens plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
