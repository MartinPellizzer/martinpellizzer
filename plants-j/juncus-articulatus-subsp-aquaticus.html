<p>Juncus articulatus subsp.</p>
<p>aquaticus, commonly known as the water rush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This species is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
