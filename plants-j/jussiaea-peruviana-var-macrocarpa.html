                    <h1>Jussiaea peruviana var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Jussiaea peruviana var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems and roots are adapted for aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>The varietal name "macrocarpa" refers to its relatively large, inflated fruit capsules.</p>
