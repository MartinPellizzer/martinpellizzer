                    <h1>Juncus balticus var. inundatus</h1>
<p>Juncus balticus var. inundatus, commonly known as the Baltic rush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. The plant thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along slow-moving waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stature compared to other juncus species.</p>
