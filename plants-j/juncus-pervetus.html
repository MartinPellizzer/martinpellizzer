                    <h1>Juncus pervetus</h1>
<p>Juncus pervetus, commonly known as the ancient rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Juncus pervetus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
