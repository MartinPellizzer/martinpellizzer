                    <h1>Juniperus communis f. laxa</h1>
<p>Juniperus communis f. laxa, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its dark, woody stems. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This form of juniper is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
