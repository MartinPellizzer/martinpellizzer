                    <h1>Jurinea sophiana</h1>
<p>Jurinea sophiana, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its silver-gray foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Jurinea sophiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
