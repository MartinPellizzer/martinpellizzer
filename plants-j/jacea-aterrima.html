<p>Jacea aterrima, commonly known as the dark jacea, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, dark violet to black flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Jacea aterrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
