<p>Jovibarba × mitchellii, commonly known as the Mitchell's houseleek, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant typically forms dense rosettes and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the spring. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Jovibarba × mitchellii is also valued for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it relatively easy to cultivate.</p>
