                    <h1>Juncus minutulus</h1>
<p>Juncus minutulus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Juncus minutulus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and erosion control.</p>
