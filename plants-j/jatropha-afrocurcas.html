                    <h1>Jatropha afrocurcas</h1>
<p>Jatropha afrocurcas, commonly known as the African croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it has been studied for its potential in biofuel production due to its high oil content.</p>
