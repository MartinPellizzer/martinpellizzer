<p>Jarava speciosa, commonly known as the showy jarava, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of small, silver-gray to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest to its appearance.</p>
<p>Jarava speciosa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
