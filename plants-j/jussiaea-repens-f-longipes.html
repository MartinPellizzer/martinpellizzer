                    <h1>Jussiaea repens f. longipes</h1>
<p>Jussiaea repens f. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed swamp willow, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The leaves are alternate, linear, and slightly hairy, adapted for water retention in its habitat. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and arranged in clusters, facilitating pollination by wind or insects.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated stems compared to the typical form, making it well-suited for aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
