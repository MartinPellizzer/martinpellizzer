                    <h1>Juniperus sargentii var. coeruleum</h1>
<p>Juniperus sargentii var. coeruleum, commonly known as the blue juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bluish-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its dark bark. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple in color, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate and ornamental value, it is often used in landscape design for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
