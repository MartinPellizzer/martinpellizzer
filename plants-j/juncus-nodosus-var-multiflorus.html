<p>Juncus nodosus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, and its stems are often reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its habitat. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, it is valued in ecological restoration projects.</p>
