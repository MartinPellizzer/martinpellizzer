<p>Jarava subaristata, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Jarava subaristata plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
