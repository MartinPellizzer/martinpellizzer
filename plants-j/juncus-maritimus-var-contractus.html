<p>Juncus maritimus var. contractus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, including salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that are often crowded and form dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and are adapted to the harsh, coastal environment.</p>
