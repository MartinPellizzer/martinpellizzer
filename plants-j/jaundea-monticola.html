                    <h1>Jaundea monticola</h1>
<p>Jaundea monticola, commonly known as the mountain jaundeweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Jaundea monticola is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found growing in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
