<p>Jurinea coronopifolia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jurinea coronopifolia is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
