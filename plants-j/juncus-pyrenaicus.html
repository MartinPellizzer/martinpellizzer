                    <h1>Juncus pyrenaicus</h1>
<p>Juncus pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean rush, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and mountain meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color and produce small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall rush-like appearance.</p>
<p>Juncus pyrenaicus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is often found in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
