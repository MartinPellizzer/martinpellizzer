<p>Jurinea serratuloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Jurinea serratuloides is adapted to harsh, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats.</p>
