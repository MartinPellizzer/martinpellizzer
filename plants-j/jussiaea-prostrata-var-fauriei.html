                    <h1>Jussiaea prostrata var. fauriei</h1>
<p>Jussiaea prostrata var. fauriei, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats near the surface of still or slow-moving water, with its rhizomes anchoring it in the muddy substrate. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are often hidden beneath the water's surface, a characteristic feature of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating or partially submerged, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor nutrient conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
