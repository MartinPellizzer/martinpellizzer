                    <h1>Jeffreycia</h1>
<p>Jeffreycia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plants typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce bulbous underground stems for storage of water and nutrients. Jeffreycia species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Their unique floral structure and ecological role make them important components of desert ecosystems.</p>
