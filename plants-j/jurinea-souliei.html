                    <h1>Jurinea souliei</h1>
<p>Jurinea souliei, commonly known as the Suli's sandplant, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, typical of xerophytic plants.</p>
<p>Jurinea souliei plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
