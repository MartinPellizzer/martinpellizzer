                    <h1>Juncus communis var. conglomeratus</h1>
<p>Juncus communis var. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It forms dense, grass-like clusters with cylindrical, often reddish stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saturated soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
