                            <h1>Jonquilla Minor</h1>
<p>Jonquilla minor is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. Known for its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow, it thrives in cool, moist environments. This species is often found in shaded forest floors and rocky crevices, where it adapts well to low-light conditions. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Jonquilla minor is now considered endangered in many areas. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this beautiful yet fragile plant.</p>
