                    <h1>Jacea corcubionensis</h1>
<p>Jacea corcubionensis, commonly known as the Corcubion wildflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, clustered leaves and delicate, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Jacea corcubionensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
