<p>Juncus bufonius var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf bog rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ability to stabilize soil, it is a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects.</p>
