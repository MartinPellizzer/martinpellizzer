The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that appear at the base of the leaf clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
