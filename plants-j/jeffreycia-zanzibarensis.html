<p>Jeffreycia zanzibarensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Zanzibar in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
