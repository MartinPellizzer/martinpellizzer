<p>Juglans regia var. tenuissima, commonly known as the Persian walnut or slender-leaved walnut, is a botanical variant of the Persian walnut tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically shorter and more delicate compared to the standard variety. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated. Its nuts are generally smaller and have a thinner shell than those of the typical Persian walnut.</p>
<p>This variant is native to regions of Central Asia and is valued for its ornamental qualities and edible nuts.</p>
