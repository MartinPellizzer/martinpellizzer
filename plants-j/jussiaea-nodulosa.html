<p>Jussiaea nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular jussiaea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of rivers, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Jussiaea nodulosa is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
