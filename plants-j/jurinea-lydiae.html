                    <h1>Jurinea lydiae</h1>
<p>Jurinea lydiae, commonly known as the Lydian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Jurinea lydiae plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
