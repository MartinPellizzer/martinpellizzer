<p>Jurinea flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along the shores of the Mediterranean. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Jurinea flaccida is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its ornamental appeal.</p>
