                    <h1>Jackiopsis ornata</h1>
<p>Jackiopsis ornata, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and the presence of yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Jackiopsis ornata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
