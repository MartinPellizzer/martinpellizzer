                    <h1>Juncus meianthus</h1>
<p>Juncus meianthus, commonly known as the pink rush, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spikes of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by wind, and the plant produces small, three-lobed fruits that disperse by wind or water.</p>
