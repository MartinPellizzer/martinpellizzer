                    <h1>Juncus capensis var. capensis</h1>
<p>Juncus capensis var. capensis, commonly known as the Cape rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are usually green or reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and water fluctuations.</p>
