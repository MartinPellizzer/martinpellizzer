                    <h1>Juniperus dumosa</h1>
<p>Juniperus dumosa, commonly known as the desert juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. Juniperus dumosa is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in desert ecosystems.</p>
