                    <h1>Juncus squarrosus var. longibracteatus</h1>
<p>Juncus squarrosus var. longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bracted rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and is typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its elongated bracts, which are longer than those of the typical Juncus squarrosus.</p>
