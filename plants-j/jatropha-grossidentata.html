                    <h1>Jatropha grossidentata</h1>
<p>Jatropha grossidentata, commonly known as the Mexican physic nut, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it a potential hazard to livestock and humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry forests.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes.</p>
