                            <h1>Jacea Carniolica</h1>
<p>Carniolica jacea, scientifically known as Jacea carniolica, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. This species belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like blooms. Jacea carniolica thrives in rocky soils and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is now classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
