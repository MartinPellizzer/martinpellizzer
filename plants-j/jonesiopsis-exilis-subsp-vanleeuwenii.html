<p>Jonesiopsis exilis subsp.</p>
<p>vanleeuwenii, commonly known as the Van Leeuwen's Jonesiopsis, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with finely divided, serrated leaves.</p>
<p>The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
