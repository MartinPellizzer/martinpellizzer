<p>Juniperus communis f. aureospica, commonly known as the golden sprig juniper, is a compact, shrub-like form of the common juniper.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the typical dark green of the species. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are similar to those of the common juniper, though they may be slightly smaller. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This form is typically found in coastal areas and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
