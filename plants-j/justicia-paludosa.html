<p>Justicia paludosa, commonly known as swamp verbena, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its flowering stems are often branched and can reach heights of up to 3 feet.</p>
<p>Justicia paludosa is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators.</p>
