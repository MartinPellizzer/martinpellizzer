<p>Juncus bufonius subsp.</p>
<p>foliosus, commonly known as the leafy rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often leafy along their length, distinguishing it from other rush species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
