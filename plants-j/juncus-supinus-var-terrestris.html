                    <h1>Juncus supinus var. terrestris</h1>
<p>Juncus supinus var. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wet or moist environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers during the summer months. It is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily and stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
