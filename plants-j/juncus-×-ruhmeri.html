                    <h1>Juncus × ruhmeri</h1>
<p>Juncus × ruhmeri, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Juncus effusus and Juncus roemerianus, two species native to coastal and wetland environments. The plant typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets of greenish or brownish flowers. It thrives in brackish or saline water, making it well adapted to coastal marshes and estuaries.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not found in the wild and is usually cultivated for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
