<p>Jurinea prasinophylla, commonly known as the green-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor it in sandy soils while accessing deep water sources.</p>
<p>Jurinea prasinophylla is often found in dunes and rocky areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
