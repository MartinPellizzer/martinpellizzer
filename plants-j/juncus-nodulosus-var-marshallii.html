                    <h1>Juncus nodulosus var. marshallii</h1>
<p>Juncus nodulosus var. marshallii, commonly known as the Marshall's tufted rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a tufted appearance. The plant typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, thriving in saturated soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish-brown flowers that are clustered in dense, nodular formations.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
