<p>Jussiaea mexiae, commonly known as Mexican water bladder, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like fruits that float on the water surface, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are submerged, while the fruiting structures are aerial.</p>
<p>Jussiaea mexiae plays a role in providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
