<p>Juncus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often swampy habitats, and is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Juncus bulbosus has a rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
