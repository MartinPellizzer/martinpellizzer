                    <h1>Jatropha vernicosa</h1>
<p>Jatropha vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Jatropha vernicosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle.</p>
