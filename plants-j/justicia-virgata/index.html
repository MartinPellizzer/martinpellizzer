                            <h1>Justicia Virgata</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Justicia virgata, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is celebrated for its delicate, mist-like blue flowers that appear in late summer and early fall. This perennial shrub thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and woodland edges. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both ornamental and ecological value. With its ability to attract pollinators and support local wildlife, Blue mistflower plays an important role in sustaining biodiversity.</p>
