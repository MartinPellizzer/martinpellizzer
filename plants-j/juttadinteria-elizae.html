<p>Juttadinteria elizae, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss, while its flowers come in shades of pink, red, and white.</p>
<p>Juttadinteria elizae is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its resilience and ornamental appeal.</p>
