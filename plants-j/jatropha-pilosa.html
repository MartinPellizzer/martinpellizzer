                    <h1>Jatropha pilosa</h1>
<p>Jatropha pilosa, commonly known as the hairy euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Jatropha pilosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-shade to full sun conditions.</p>
