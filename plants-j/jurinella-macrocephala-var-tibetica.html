                    <h1>Jurinella macrocephala var. tibetica</h1>
<p>Jurinella macrocephala var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, often forming dense clusters at the top of its slender stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display.</p>
