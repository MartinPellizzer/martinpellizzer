                    <h1>Juniperus grandis</h1>
<p>Juniperus grandis, commonly known as the giant juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Its needle-like leaves are dark green and retain their color year-round, contributing to its evergreen nature.</p>
<p>Juniperus grandis is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
