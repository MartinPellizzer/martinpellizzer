                    <h1>Juniperus cinerascens</h1>
<p>Juniperus cinerascens, commonly known as the ash juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are edible and contain aromatic oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Juniperus cinerascens is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
