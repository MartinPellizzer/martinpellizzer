                    <h1>Juncus acutiflorus var. microcephalus</h1>
<p>Juncus acutiflorus var. microcephalus, commonly known as the dwarf spike rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that are typically less than 30 cm in height, with small, dense spikes of greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The foliage is characterized by narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
