<p>Juniperus communis subsp.</p>
<p>nana, commonly known as dwarf juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It features compact, dense foliage with scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is highly frost-resistant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
