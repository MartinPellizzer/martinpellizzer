                    <h1>Juncus nodulosus</h1>
<p>Juncus nodulosus, commonly known as the nodular rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact, cylindrical flowering spikes that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pale green to brown, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
