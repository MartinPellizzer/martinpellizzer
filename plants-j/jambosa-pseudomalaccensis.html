                    <h1>Jambosa pseudomalaccensis</h1>
<p>Jambosa pseudomalaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca jambosa, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the common jambosa, though they are less widely consumed.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
