<p>Jonesiopsis caesarea subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as the coastal jonesiopsis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important species for ecological studies in coastal botany.</p>
