                    <h1>Juniperus turbinata</h1>
<p>Juniperus turbinata, commonly known as the desert juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and small, berry-like cones that mature to a bluish-black color. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil conditions. Its evergreen foliage provides year-round cover and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Juniperus turbinata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
