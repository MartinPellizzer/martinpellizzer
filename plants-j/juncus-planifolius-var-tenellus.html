<p>Juncus planifolius var. tenellus, commonly known as the slender flatleaf rush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Juncaceae family and typically grows in moist, often wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat and arranged in dense clusters. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed berries.</p>
