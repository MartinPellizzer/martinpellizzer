                    <h1>Juncus balticus var. mexicanus</h1>
<p>Juncus balticus var. mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican rush, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface and a waxy coating that aids in water retention.</p>
