<p>Jovibarba globifera subsp.</p>
<p>pseudohirta, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves covered in a fine, woolly coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, though it is sensitive to prolonged damp conditions.</p>
