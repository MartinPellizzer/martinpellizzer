                    <h1>Jurinea densisquamea</h1>
<p>Jurinea densisquamea, commonly known as the dense-squamate jurinea, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense covering of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in harsh environments with poor soil and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Jurinea densisquamea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
