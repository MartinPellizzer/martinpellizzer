<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with characteristic cyathia, or cup-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, displaying a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The showy yellow flowers are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are a defining feature of the genus.</p>
