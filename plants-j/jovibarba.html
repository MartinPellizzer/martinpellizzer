<p>Jovibarba, commonly known as the "hairy stonecrop," is a genus of succulent plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their fleshy, often hairy leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Jovibarba species are typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they form dense mats or low-growing clusters. The leaves are usually blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Many species are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
