<p>Jussiaea affinis var. multiflora, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to aquatic conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
