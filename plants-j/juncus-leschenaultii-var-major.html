<p>Juncus leschenaultii var. major, commonly known as the giant rush, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
