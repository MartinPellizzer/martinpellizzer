                    <h1>Jurinea pinnata</h1>
<p>Jurinea pinnata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue flowers and grayish-green, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh maritime climates.</p>
<p>Jurinea pinnata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
