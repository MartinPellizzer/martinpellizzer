                    <h1>Juncus pygmaeus var. minae</h1>
<p>Juncus pygmaeus var. minae, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically less than 10 cm in height, adapted for waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the tips of its stems, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
