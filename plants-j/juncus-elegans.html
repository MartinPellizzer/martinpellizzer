<p>Juncus elegans, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bright green and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Juncus elegans is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
