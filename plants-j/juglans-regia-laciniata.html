<p>Juglans regia laciniata, commonly known as the Persian walnut or split-leaf walnut, is a variant of the Persian walnut tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The tree produces large, edible nuts encased in a thick, green husk that splits open when mature. Its fruit is typically harvested in the fall and is prized for its rich, oily kernel.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and carving.</p>
