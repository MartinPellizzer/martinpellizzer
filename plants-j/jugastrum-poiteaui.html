                    <h1>Jugastrum poiteaui</h1>
<p>Jugastrum poiteaui, commonly known as the Poitevin's jugastrum, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Juglandaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring compound leaves with serrated margins and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible nuts encased in a thick, woody husk, which are typically harvested in late autumn. Native to a limited geographic range in southern France, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, Jugastrum poiteaui is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
