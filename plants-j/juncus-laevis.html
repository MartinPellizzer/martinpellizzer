                    <h1>Juncus laevis</h1>
<p>Juncus laevis, commonly known as the smooth rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are smooth and lack the rough texture found in other rush species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that grow in dense clusters at the top of its stems. Juncus laevis typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in saturated conditions makes it a valuable indicator plant for assessing wetland health.</p>
