<p>Jamesonia maxonii, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are relatively showy for its size. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, Jamesonia maxonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
