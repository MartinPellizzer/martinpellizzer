                    <h1>Juncus perparvus</h1>
<p>Juncus perparvus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, usually found at the tips of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and contributes to the ecological health of wetland environments.</p>
<p>Juncus perparvus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
