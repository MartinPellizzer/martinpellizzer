<p>Juncus × alpiniformis, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Juncus alpina and Juncus bufonius.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purple in color, and its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Juncus × alpiniformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
