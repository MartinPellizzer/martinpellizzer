                    <h1>Juncus bulbosus f. pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Juncus bulbosus f. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, forming dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, upright spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats.</p>
