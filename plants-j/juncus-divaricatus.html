                    <h1>Juncus divaricatus</h1>
<p>Juncus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils and can be found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Juncus divaricatus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
