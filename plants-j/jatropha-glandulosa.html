                    <h1>Jatropha glandulosa</h1>
<p>Jatropha glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and palmate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic, orange-red seeds. Jatropha glandulosa is often found in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands.</p>
<p>Its toxic properties make it a plant of caution, though it has been studied for potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
