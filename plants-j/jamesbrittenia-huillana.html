<p>Jamesbrittenia huillana, commonly known as the Huillan mountain fern, is a species native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
