The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
