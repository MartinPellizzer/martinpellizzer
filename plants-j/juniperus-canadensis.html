                    <h1>Juniperus canadensis</h1>
<p>Juniperus canadensis, commonly known as eastern red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, scale-like leaves and produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>The wood of Juniperus canadensis is durable and has been historically used for fence posts and other outdoor structures.</p>
