                    <h1>Juncellus lateralis</h1>
<p>Juncellus lateralis, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters, with cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny greenish-white flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in moist habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Juncellus lateralis is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions and is often found in temperate regions across Europe and Asia.</p>
