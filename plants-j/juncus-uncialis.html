<p>Juncus uncialis, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Juncaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is typically found in moist or wet environments such as marshes, wetlands, and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Juncus uncialis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
