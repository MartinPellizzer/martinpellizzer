                    <h1>Juniperus compressa</h1>
<p>Juniperus compressa, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a shrub-like evergreen conifer native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has scale-like leaves that are closely pressed against the branches, giving it a dense, compact appearance. Its small, blue-gray berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Juniperus compressa is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
