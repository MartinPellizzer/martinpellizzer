<p>Juncus umbellatus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense stands with cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often reddish or brownish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in an umbel-like arrangement, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Juncus umbellatus plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
