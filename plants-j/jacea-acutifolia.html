                    <h1>Jacea acutifolia</h1>
<p>Jacea acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved jacea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
