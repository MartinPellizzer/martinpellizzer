                    <h1>Juniperus umbilicata</h1>
<p>Juniperus umbilicata, commonly known as the rock juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to arid and rocky regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a compact, spherical shape with dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a high tolerance for drought.</p>
<p>Juniperus umbilicata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
