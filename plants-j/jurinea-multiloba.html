<p>Jurinea multiloba, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss, while its roots are extensive and help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Jurinea multiloba plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
