                    <h1>Jussiaea repens f. brevipes</h1>
<p>Jussiaea repens f. brevipes, commonly known as the compact jussiaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in South America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its shorter, more compact form compared to the typical species, making it well adapted to its moist, often nutrient-poor habitat.</p>
