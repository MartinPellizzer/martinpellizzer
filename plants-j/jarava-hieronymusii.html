                    <h1>Jarava hieronymusii</h1>
<p>Jarava hieronymusii, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Jarava hieronymusii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
