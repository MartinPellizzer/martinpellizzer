                    <h1>Juncus effusus var. macranthelus</h1>
<p>Juncus effusus var. macranthelus, commonly known as the broad-flowered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and its showy, spike-like inflorescence that bears large, pale to greenish flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
