                    <h1>Juncus pygmaeus var. lacustris</h1>
<p>Juncus pygmaeus var. lacustris, commonly known as the lake rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, arranged in spikes along the stems. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize sediments, it plays a role in preventing erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
