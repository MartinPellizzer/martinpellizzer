                    <h1>Jasione orbiculata var. supinoides</h1>
<p>Jasione orbiculata var. supinoides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are rounded and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth and ornamental flowers.</p>
