<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are usually green or reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
