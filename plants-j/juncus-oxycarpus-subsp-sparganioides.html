<p>Juncus oxycarpus subsp.</p>
<p>sparganioides, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish at the base.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
