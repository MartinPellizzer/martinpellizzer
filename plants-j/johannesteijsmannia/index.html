It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the dense rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. This evergreen tree is known for its distinctive appearance, featuring thick, leathery leaves and a slow growth rate. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now critically endangered and listed on the IUCN Red List. Its conservation is vital for maintaining the ecological balance of its native environment.</p>
