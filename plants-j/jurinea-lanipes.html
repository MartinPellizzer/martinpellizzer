<p>Jurinea lanipes, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptations to harsh conditions, it is considered a resilient species in its native range.</p>
