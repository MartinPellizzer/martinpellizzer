<p>Juniperus communis f. oblonga-pendula, commonly known as the pendulous juniper, is a compact, dwarf shrub characterized by its drooping, oblong-shaped foliage.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically retained on the plant throughout the winter. It is native to northern regions and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal.</p>
