                    <h1>Juncus acutiflorus var. nemorosus</h1>
<p>Juncus acutiflorus var. nemorosus, commonly known as the forest rush, is a perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with slender, grass-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland floors, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick mats, making it an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems.</p>
