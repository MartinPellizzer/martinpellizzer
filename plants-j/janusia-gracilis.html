                    <h1>Janusia gracilis</h1>
<p>Janusia gracilis, commonly known as the slender glasswort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and estuaries. The plant has thin, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink or red, and they bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Janusia gracilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
