                    <h1>Juniperus triangularis</h1>
<p>Juniperus triangularis, commonly known as the Mexican juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Juniperus triangularis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of its native ecosystems.</p>
