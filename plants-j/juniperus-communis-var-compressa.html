                    <h1>Juniperus communis var. compressa</h1>
<p>Juniperus communis var. compressa, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast to its dark red or purple stems. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its ability to form dense ground cover in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
