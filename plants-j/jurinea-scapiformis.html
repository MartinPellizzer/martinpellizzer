<p>Jurinea scapiformis, commonly known as the scapiform sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Jurinea scapiformis is well adapted to salty, windy environments and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands.</p>
