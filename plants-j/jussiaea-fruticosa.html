                    <h1>Jussiaea fruticosa</h1>
<p>Jussiaea fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and its striking, bright red to orange bottlebrush-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline and windy environments. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Jussiaea fruticosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
