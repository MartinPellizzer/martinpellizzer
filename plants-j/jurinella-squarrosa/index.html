<p>Jurinella squarrosa is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is known for its unique, woolly appearance. This species is often overlooked due to its small size and subtle blooms. Conservation efforts are crucial as it faces threats from habitat loss and climate change. Understanding and protecting Jurinella squarrosa is essential for preserving biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
