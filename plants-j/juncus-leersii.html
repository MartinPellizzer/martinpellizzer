<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Juncus leersii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
