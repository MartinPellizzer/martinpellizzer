                    <h1>Justicia aquatica var. aquatica</h1>
<p>Justicia aquatica var. aquatica, commonly known as waterwheel plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features whorled leaves that are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red, pink, or white, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it both a useful aquatic vegetation and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
