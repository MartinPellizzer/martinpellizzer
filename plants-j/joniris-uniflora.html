<p>Joniris uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, solitary flower that typically blooms in late summer or early autumn. The plant has a slender stem and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it survive in its harsh, cold environment. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Joniris uniflora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
