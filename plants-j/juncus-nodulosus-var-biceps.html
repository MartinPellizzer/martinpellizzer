                    <h1>Juncus nodulosus var. biceps</h1>
<p>Juncus nodulosus var. biceps, commonly known as the two-stemmed rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and cylindrical. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered at the base of the stems, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The varietal name "biceps" refers to the presence of two distinct stem types within the same plant.</p>
