<p>Juncus compressus f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its longer, more slender stems compared to the typical form, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet habitats.</p>
