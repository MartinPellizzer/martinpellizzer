<p>Jatropha heterophylla, commonly known as the variable jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either ovate or lanceolate depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsules containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
