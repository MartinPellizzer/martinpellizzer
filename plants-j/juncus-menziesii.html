<p>Juncus menziesii, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. This plant typically grows in wet or saline environments, such as tidal marshes and coastal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in these habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus menziesii plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
