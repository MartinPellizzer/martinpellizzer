                    <h1>Juncus articulatus f. natans</h1>
<p>Juncus articulatus f. natans, commonly known as the floating rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits unique aquatic adaptations.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its ability to float on the water surface, with its stems and leaves extending into the water. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows.</p>
