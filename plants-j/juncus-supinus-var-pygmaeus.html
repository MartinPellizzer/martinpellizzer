                    <h1>Juncus supinus var. pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Juncus supinus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that are usually less than 10 cm in height, with whorled leaves that are narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late summer, typically in shades of green or brown, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing form and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
