                    <h1>Juniperus semiglobosa</h1>
<p>Juniperus semiglobosa, commonly known as the globe juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape, dense foliage, and blue-gray needles that provide year-round color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Juniperus semiglobosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
