                    <h1>Juncus caricinus</h1>
<p>Juncus caricinus, commonly known as the soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats across temperate regions.</p>
<p>It has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often reddish or greenish in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, while its dense growth provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Juncus caricinus is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
