                    <h1>Jacksonia scoparia var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Jacksonia scoparia var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as pines and firs, through specialized structures called haustoria. It is often found in forested areas, where it contributes to the ecological dynamics of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health and growth of its host plants.</p>
