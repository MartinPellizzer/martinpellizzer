<p>Juniperus virginiana pendula-nana, commonly known as the dwarf creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage that forms a mat-like growth habit, with small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, spherical blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This juniper is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
