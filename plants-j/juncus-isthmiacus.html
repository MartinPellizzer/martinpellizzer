<p>Juncus isthmiacus, commonly known as the Isthmus rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Juncus isthmiacus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water environments.</p>
