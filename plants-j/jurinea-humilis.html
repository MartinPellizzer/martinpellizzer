<p>Jurinea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Jurinea humilis is adapted to harsh coastal climates and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
