<p>Jirasekia alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaved jirasekia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
