                    <h1>Jurinea dumulosa var. hirticephala</h1>
<p>Jurinea dumulosa var. hirticephala, commonly known as the hairy-headed sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens.</p>
