                    <h1>Jurinea subhastata</h1>
<p>Jurinea subhastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>Jurinea subhastata is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray.</p>
