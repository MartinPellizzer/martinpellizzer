<p>Jussiaea repens subsp.</p>
<p>glabrata, commonly known as the smooth trailing jussiaea, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, elliptical leaves are smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and are usually clustered in small inflorescences.</p>
