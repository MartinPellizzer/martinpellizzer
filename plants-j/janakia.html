<p>Janakia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient India, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Janakia species are typically found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. They play an important role in traditional medicine and cultural practices in South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in still waters makes it a valuable indicator of water quality.</p>
