<p>multiloba, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
