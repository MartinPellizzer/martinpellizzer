                    <h1>Juncus arequipensis</h1>
<p>Juncus arequipensis, commonly known as the Arequipa rush, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions with cool, temperate climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Juncus arequipensis is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
