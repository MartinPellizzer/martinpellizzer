<p>Jonesiopsis ultima, commonly known as the rare Himalayan fern, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock faces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and fragile nature, Jonesiopsis ultima is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
