                    <h1>Juniperus litoralis</h1>
<p>Juniperus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against the rocky or sandy environments it inhabits. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates with frequent salt spray.</p>
<p>Juniperus litoralis is valued for its resilience and is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions.</p>
