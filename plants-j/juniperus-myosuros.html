                    <h1>Juniperus myosuros</h1>
<p>Juniperus myosuros, commonly known as the common juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems, forming a dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Juniperus myosuros is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been used historically in construction and as a source of essential oils.</p>
