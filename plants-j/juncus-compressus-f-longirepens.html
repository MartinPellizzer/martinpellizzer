<p>Juncus compressus f. longirepens, commonly known as the long-stemmed rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, making it visually distinct from other rush species. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams.</p>
