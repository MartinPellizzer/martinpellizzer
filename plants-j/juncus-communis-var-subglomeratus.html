<p>Juncus communis var. subglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its tightly packed inflorescences, which give it its common name.</p>
