                    <h1>Juglans × vilmoriniana</h1>
<p>Juglans × vilmoriniana, commonly known as the Vilmorin walnut, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Juglans regia (Persian walnut) and Juglans mandshurica (Manchurian walnut).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, robust nuts with thick, husks that split open to reveal the edible kernels. The tree is a medium to large deciduous tree, typically reaching heights of 10–20 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are compound, with 15–23 lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces yellowish-green flowers in catkins.</p>
<p>The Vilmorin walnut is valued for its hardy nature and the quality of its nuts, making it a popular choice for cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
