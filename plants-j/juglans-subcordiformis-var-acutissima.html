                    <h1>Juglans subcordiformis var. acutissima</h1>
<p>Juglans subcordiformis var. acutissima, commonly known as the Acute-leaf Black Walnut, is a variant of the black walnut tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, acute-angled leaves that are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, husky outer layer. Its bark is rugged and ridged, often with a dark, almost black appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardy nature and potential for nut production in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
