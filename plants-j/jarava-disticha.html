                <h1>Jarava disticha</h1>
<p>Jarava disticha, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. Jarava disticha is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
