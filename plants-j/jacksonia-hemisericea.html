<p>Jacksonia hemisericea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>

The plant features bright yellow ray flowers surrounded by a disk of smaller florets, typical of the genus Jacksonia. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
