<p>Jateorhiza calumba, commonly known as the African blue flag, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are sword-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
