                    <h1>Juncus chloroticus</h1>
<p>Juncus chloroticus, commonly known as the yellow rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often display a yellowish or reddish hue, particularly in its younger growth stages. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming a low, mat-like structure that helps stabilize soil in moist habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>Juncus chloroticus is valued for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
