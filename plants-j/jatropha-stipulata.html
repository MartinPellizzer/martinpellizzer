                    <h1>Jatropha stipulata</h1>
<p>Jatropha stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Jatropha stipulata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for garden use.</p>
