                    <h1>Juglans</h1>
<p>Juglans, commonly known as walnuts, are deciduous trees belonging to the family Juglandaceae.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with 15 to 23 leaflets. The trees produce hard, woody fruits called nuts, encased in a spiny husk that splits open when mature. The nuts are rich in oils and are widely used in both culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Juglans species are native to the Northern Hemisphere and are valued for their timber, nuts, and ornamental qualities.</p>
