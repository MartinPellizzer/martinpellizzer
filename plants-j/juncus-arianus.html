<p>Juncus arianus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and its stems are typically reddish or brownish in color. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. Juncus arianus is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
