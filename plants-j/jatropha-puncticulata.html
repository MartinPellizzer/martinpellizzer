<p>Jatropha puncticulata, commonly known as the spined spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and dry forests.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
