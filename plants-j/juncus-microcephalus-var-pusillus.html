                    <h1>Juncus microcephalus var. pusillus</h1>
<p>Juncus microcephalus var. pusillus, commonly known as dwarf rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pale green to brown, and the plant plays a role in water filtration and erosion control in wetland ecosystems.</p>
