                    <h1>Juncus fontanesii var. lagenarius</h1>
<p>Juncus fontanesii var. lagenarius, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds and in damp meadows. The plant features cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in the summer months. Its unique feature is the presence of bladder-like structures in its inflorescence, which are specialized seed pods.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils.</p>
