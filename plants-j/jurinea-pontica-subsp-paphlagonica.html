<p>Jurinea pontica subsp.</p>
<p>paphlagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it thrives in saline and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to coastal environments.</p>
