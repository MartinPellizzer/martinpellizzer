<p>Juncus pallidus, commonly known as the pale rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Juncus pallidus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
