<p>Juniperus foetida var. virginiana, commonly known as the eastern redcedar, is a deciduous conifer native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that turn reddish in the fall, and its small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds.

It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>The tree is also known for its role in the production of cedarwood oil, which has various industrial applications.</p>
