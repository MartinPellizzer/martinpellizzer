                    <h1>Jurinea sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Jurinea sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, silver-green leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its structure is compact, with a low-growing habit that helps it conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Jurinea sclerophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
