<p>Jurinea mollis subsp.</p>
<p>mollis, commonly known as the soft sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and can thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
