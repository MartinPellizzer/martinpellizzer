                    <h1>Jatropha tetracantha</h1>
<p>Jatropha tetracantha, commonly known as the four-spined jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, three-lobed capsules containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is generally avoided as a food source and is more valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties.</p>
