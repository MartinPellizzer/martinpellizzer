<p>Jarava nicorae, commonly known as the Nicora grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Jarava nicorae is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
