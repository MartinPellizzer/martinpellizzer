                    <h1>Juncus stygius</h1>
<p>Juncus stygius, commonly known as the swamp rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Juncus stygius plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
