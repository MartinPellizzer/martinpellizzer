                    <h1>Juniperus zaidamensis f. squarrosa</h1>
<p>Juniperus zaidamensis f. squarrosa, commonly known as the Zaidam juniper, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of juniper native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces blue-black berries that are typically retained on the plant for several years, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rocky slopes and in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
