                    <h1>Jatropha foetida</h1>
<p>Jatropha foetida, commonly known as the stinkbean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, black seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. Jatropha foetida is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Its strong, unpleasant odor is a notable feature that distinguishes it from other members of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
