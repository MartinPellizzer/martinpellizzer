<p>Juncus oligocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, growing up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Juncus oligocephalus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
