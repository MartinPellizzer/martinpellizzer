<p>Juncus articulatus subsp.</p>
<p>limosus, commonly known as the swamp rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist to water-saturated soils, making it a common sight in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust and often darker-colored stems compared to other members of the Juncus genus.</p>
