                    <h1>Juncus subnodulosus var. condensatus</h1>
<p>Juncus subnodulosus var. condensatus, commonly known as the dense club rush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth compared to other juncus species, making it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
