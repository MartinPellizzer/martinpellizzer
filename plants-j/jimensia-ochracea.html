                    <h1>Jimensia ochracea</h1>
<p>Jimensia ochracea, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture availability. Jimensia ochracea is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides or in dry washes.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivorous insects.</p>
