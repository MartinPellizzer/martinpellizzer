<p>Juncus duvalii, commonly known as Duval's rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in moist or saturated soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark, spherical berries. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Juncus duvalii plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wetland wildlife species.</p>
