                    <h1>Juncus buckleyi</h1>
<p>Juncus buckleyi, commonly known as Buckley's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wetlands, and disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Buckley's rush is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wetland environments.</p>
