<p>Juncus anthelatus, commonly known as the redstem bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland areas in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the ends of the stems, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Juncus anthelatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
