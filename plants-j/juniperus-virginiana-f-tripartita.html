                    <h1>Juniperus virginiana f. tripartita</h1>
<p>Juniperus virginiana f. tripartita, commonly known as the tripartite red cedar, is a rare and distinct form of the eastern red cedar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, which consists of three-pronged, scale-like leaves that give it a distinct appearance compared to the typical juniper. This form is native to specific regions of the southeastern United States, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its genetic variation and ecological role within its native habitat.</p>
