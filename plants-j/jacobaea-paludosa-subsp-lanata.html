<p>Jacobaea paludosa subsp.</p>
<p>lanata, commonly known as the woolly marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its subspecies name, *lanata*, refers to the lanate (woolly) texture of its foliage.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects.</p>
