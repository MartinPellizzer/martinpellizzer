                    <h1>Jovibarba globifera var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Jovibarba globifera var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry, Mediterranean climates.</p>
