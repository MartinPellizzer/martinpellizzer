The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of freshwater bodies. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
