<p>Jurinea komarovii, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Jurinea komarovii is well-suited to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
