<p>Juncus corralensis, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass-like plant that typically grows in wet or brackish environments such as tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. It has adapted to saline conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil along shorelines.</p>
