                    <h1>Juncus coriaceus</h1>
<p>Juncus coriaceus, commonly known as tough rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are densely packed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in saturated soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Juncus coriaceus is also valued for its ability to filter water and support diverse wildlife habitats.</p>
