<p>Jenkinsonia lacera, commonly known as the slender jenkinsonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jenkinsonia lacera is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
