                    <h1>Juniperus pingii var. pingii</h1>
<p>Juniperus pingii var. pingii, commonly known as the Chinese juniper or mountain juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to regions of China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scaly foliage that ranges from gray-green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue or purple when mature. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in colder climates for its winter interest and architectural form.</p>
