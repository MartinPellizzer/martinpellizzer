<p>Juno austrotschatkalica, commonly known as the Kashmir juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree that thrives in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue or black in color. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dense and provide some insulation against harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Juno austrotschatkalica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
