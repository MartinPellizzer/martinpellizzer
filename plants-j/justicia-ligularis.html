                    <h1>Justicia ligularis</h1>
<p>Justicia ligularis, commonly known as the silver bush or blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring slender, branching stems covered in dense, silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from both its striking foliage and its long-lasting, showy blooms.</p>
