                    <h1>Jussiaea peruviana var. australis</h1>
<p>Jussiaea peruviana var. australis, commonly known as the Australian water lettuce, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America and Australia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that float on the water surface, with a spongy, air-filled tissue that helps it stay afloat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
