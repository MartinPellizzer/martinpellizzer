                    <h1>Juglans subcordiformis nothovar. avellana</h1>
<p>Juglans subcordiformis nothovar. avellana, commonly known as the hybrid walnut, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Juglans subcordiformis and Juglans regia.</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, subcordate leaf shape and a robust, nut-bearing habit. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its nuts are typically larger than those of J. subcordiformis but smaller than those of J. regia.</p>
<p>This nothovar is valued for its hardiness and potential for nut production in cultivation.</p>
