                    <h1>Juncus bufonius var. congdonii</h1>
<p>Juncus bufonius var. congdonii, commonly known as the Congdon's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from other juncus species by its specific geographic distribution and morphological features.</p>
