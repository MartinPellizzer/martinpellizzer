                    <h1>Juniperus brevifolia</h1>
<p>Juniperus brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus brevifolia is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in poor soils and requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
