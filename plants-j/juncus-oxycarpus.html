                    <h1>Juncus oxycarpus</h1>
<p>Juncus oxycarpus, commonly known as the sharp-fruited rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense stands, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Juncus oxycarpus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
