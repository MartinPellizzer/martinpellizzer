                    <h1>Juncus bufonius var. pumilus</h1>
<p>Juncus bufonius var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf bog rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often brown or reddish in color. It is a perennial species that spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
