<p>Jatropha wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's blistering tree, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by orange-red, spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open forests.</p>
<p>Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
