                    <h1>Ipomoea bolusiana var. elongata</h1>
<p>Ipomoea bolusiana var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or blue. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its vines can climb and spread rapidly, making it both ornamental and potentially invasive.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name.</p>
