<p>Isoetes velata subsp.</p>
<p>asturicensis, commonly known as the Asturian watermace, is a rare aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds. It is characterized by its spore-bearing fronds and a unique morphology adapted to submerged conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizome that anchors it in the substrate, while its leaves are often finely divided. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in the region of Asturias.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
