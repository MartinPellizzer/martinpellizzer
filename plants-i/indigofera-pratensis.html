                    <h1>Indigofera pratensis</h1>
<p>Indigofera pratensis, commonly known as field indigo, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>Its historical use in dye production has also contributed to its recognition in botanical studies.</p>
