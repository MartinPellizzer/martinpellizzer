                    <h1>Isolepis capillaris var. capitata</h1>
<p>Isolepis capillaris var. capitata, commonly known as the tufted spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, grass-like foliage with slender, cylindrical stems that often form compact, tufted clusters at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically emerging from the upper part of the stem. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth form compared to the typical varietal form of Isolepis capillaris.</p>
