                    <h1>Ischnea spathulata</h1>
<p>Ischnea spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf ischnea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist environments. The plant produces striking, spatulate-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Ischnea spathulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to waterlogged soils.</p>
