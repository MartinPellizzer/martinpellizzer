<p>Isoetes maritima, commonly known as the sea spike-moss, is a member of the water fern family (Polypodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern that typically grows in brackish or freshwater environments. The plant has a distinctive, spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is clustered at the tip of its leaf-like structures. Its leaves are usually spirally arranged and can be either submerged or floating depending on the water conditions.</p>
<p>Isoetes maritima plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
