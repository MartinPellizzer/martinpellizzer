<p>Ichnanthus rondonii, commonly known as the Rondonii marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
