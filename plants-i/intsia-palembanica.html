                    <h1>Intsia palembanica</h1>
<p>Intsia palembanica, commonly known as the Philippine rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall and has broad, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
