                    <h1>Isoetes × dodgei var. robbinsii</h1>
<p>Isoetes × dodgei var. robbinsii, commonly known as the Robbins' water starwort, is a rare aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a rosette-like formation on the upper surface of its leaves. The plant has a delicate, submerged stem with finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that contribute to its distinctive appearance. It is native to North America and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
