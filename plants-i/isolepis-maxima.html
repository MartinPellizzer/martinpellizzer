<p>Isolepis maxima, commonly known as the giant spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Isolepis maxima is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
