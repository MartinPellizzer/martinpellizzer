<p>Ipomoea pes-caprae, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy coastal environments and is highly tolerant of salt spray and poor soil conditions.
