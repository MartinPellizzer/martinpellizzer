                    <h1>Ixiolirion macranthum</h1>
<p>Ixiolirion macranthum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Ixiolirion macranthum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
