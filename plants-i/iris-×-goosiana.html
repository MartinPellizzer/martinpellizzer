                    <h1>Iris × goosiana</h1>
<p>Iris × goosiana, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris sibirica and Iris pseudacorus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a darker throat and a robust, upright growth habit. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, making it a common sight in marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in wetland ecosystems.</p>
