                    <h1>Ionidium durum</h1>
<p>Ionidium durum, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a resilient shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, woody stems that are highly resistant to drought and extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, angular seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Ionidium durum plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert wildlife species.</p>
