                <h1>Isolepis filamentosa</h1>
<p>Isolepis filamentosa, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense tussocks with slender, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Isolepis filamentosa plays an important role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and birds.</p>
