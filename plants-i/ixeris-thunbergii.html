<p>Ixeris thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese lawngrass or golden groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
<p>Ixeris thunbergii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
