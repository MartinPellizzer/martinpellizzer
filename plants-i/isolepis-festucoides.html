<p>Isolepis festucoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf pond grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive mats, stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Isolepis festucoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
