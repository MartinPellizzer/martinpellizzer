<p>Isoetes cangae, commonly known as the Cangae watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a structure known as a strobilus. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds, where it thrives in shallow, still water. Its morphology includes a rosette-like arrangement of leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves extending above the water surface.</p>
<p>Isoetes cangae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling in its environment.</p>
