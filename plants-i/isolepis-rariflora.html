<p>Isolepis rariflora, commonly known as the rare bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomes help it spread and stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isolepis rariflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
