                    <h1>Illecebrum atrorubens</h1>
<p>Illecebrum atrorubens, commonly known as the red-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, tangled growth pattern that gives it its scientific name. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause damage to agricultural crops.</p>
