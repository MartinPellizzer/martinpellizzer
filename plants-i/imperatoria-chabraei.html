<p>Imperatoria chabraei, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
