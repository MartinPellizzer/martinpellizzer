<p>Isoetes echinospora subf.</p>
<p>lativelata, commonly known as the spiky water horsetail, is a rare and ancient aquatic plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems and spore-producing cones, which are typically found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a central axis and whorls of small, spore-bearing structures called strobils. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often in nutrient-rich sediments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
