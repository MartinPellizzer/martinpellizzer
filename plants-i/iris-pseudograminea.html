                    <h1>Iris pseudograminea</h1>
<p>Iris pseudograminea, commonly known as the slender iris, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
