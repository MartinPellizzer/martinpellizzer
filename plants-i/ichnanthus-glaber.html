                    <h1>Ichnanthus glaber</h1>
<p>Ichnanthus glaber, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or peaty soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Ichnanthus glaber is an indicator species for acidic, nutrient-poor environments and is often used in ecological studies to assess wetland health.</p>
