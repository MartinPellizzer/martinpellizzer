<p>Indigofera retrusa, commonly known as the small indigo or African indigo, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate. It is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in dry or semi-arid regions.</p>
