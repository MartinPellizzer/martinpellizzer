                    <h1>Isopogon anemonifolius f. simplicifolia</h1>
<p>Isopogon anemonifolius f. simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved bottlebrush, is a unique variant of the Isopogon genus native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced, simple leaves that contrast with the typical compound foliage of the species. The plant produces striking red or orange bottlebrush-like inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal gardens.</p>
