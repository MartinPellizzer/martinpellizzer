<p>Iridodictyum kolpakowskianum, commonly known as the Kolpakowski's spikegrass, is a rare and delicate grass species native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in dense spikes. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a basal rosette of leaves that support its flowering stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
