<p>Imperata arundinacea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cogongrass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and wide, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, white to reddish flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
