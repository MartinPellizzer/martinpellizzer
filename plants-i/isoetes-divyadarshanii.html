                    <h1>Isoetes divyadarshanii</h1>
<p>Isoetes divyadarshanii, commonly known as the Divyadarshan spike-moss, is a rare species of aquatic fern belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spore-bearing spikes that protrude from the water's surface, a unique adaptation for dispersal. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, forming a rosette structure around the spore-bearing axis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
