                    <h1>Ilex ferox</h1>
<p>Ilex ferox, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that have a rough texture and serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex ferox thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping.</p>
