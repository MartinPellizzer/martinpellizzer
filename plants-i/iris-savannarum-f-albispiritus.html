                    <h1>Iris savannarum f. albispiritus</h1>
<p>Iris savannarum f. albispiritus, commonly known as the White Spirited Iris, is a rare and striking variant of the iris genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers, which are often described as having a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. This form is typically found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, upright flower stalks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists alike.</p>
