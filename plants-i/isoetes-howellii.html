<p>Isoetes howellii, commonly known as Howell's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Sphenopsida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, ribbon-like leaves that form a rosette at the water's surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on specialized stems called strobila. Isoetes howellii is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive strategy make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
