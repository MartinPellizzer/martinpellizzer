<p>Isoetes capillacea, commonly known as the slender watermace, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like fronds that are typically submerged in water. The plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, stalked clusters called sorus.</p>
<p>Isoetes capillacea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
