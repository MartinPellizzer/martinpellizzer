<p>Isachne depauperata, commonly known as the poor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. Its reproductive structures are wind-pollinated, and it spreads primarily through rhizomes.</p>
<p>Isachne depauperata plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
