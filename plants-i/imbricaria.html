<p>Imbricaria, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that are often arranged in an imbricate or overlapping pattern, giving the plant its name. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Imbricaria species are typically found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>They are often mistaken for true nettles due to their similar appearance but lack the stinging hairs.</p>
