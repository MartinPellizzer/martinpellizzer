<p>Isolepis truncata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous grass, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Isolepis truncata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in water-saturated conditions.</p>
