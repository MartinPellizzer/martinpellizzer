                    <h1>Iris pseudacorus var. bastardii</h1>
<p>Iris pseudacorus var. bastardii, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a variant of the yellow flag iris native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its striking yellow flowers and broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies due to its preference for moist soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense stands.</p>
<p>While it is valued for its ornamental qualities, it can become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
