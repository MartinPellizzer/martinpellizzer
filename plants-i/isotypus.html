                    <h1>Isotypus</h1>
<p>Isotypus, commonly known as the type species, refers to the original plant specimen used to describe a species in botanical nomenclature.</p>
<p>It serves as the reference point for the scientific name of a species, ensuring consistency and accuracy in classification. The isotypus is often housed in a herbarium and is crucial for verifying the characteristics of the species. It may include multiple specimens collected from the same location and time as the holotype.</p>
<p>Botanists rely on the isotypus to study variations and confirm the validity of species descriptions.</p>
