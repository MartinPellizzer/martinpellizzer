                    <h1>Ipomoea procumbens var. longepedunculata</h1>
<p>Ipomoea procumbens var. longepedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its climbing habit is supported by tendrils that allow it to spread along trellises or fences.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies.</p>
