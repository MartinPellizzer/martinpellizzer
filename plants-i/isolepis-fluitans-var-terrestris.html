                    <h1>Isolepis fluitans var. terrestris</h1>
<p>Isolepis fluitans var. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense tufts, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It is often found in shallow water or moist soils, contributing to the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems.</p>
