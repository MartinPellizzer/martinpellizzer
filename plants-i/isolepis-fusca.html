<p>Isolepis fusca, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
