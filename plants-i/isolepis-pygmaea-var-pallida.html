                    <h1>Isolepis pygmaea var. pallida</h1>
<p>Isolepis pygmaea var. pallida, commonly known as the pale tufted sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically pale green, with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is often used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
