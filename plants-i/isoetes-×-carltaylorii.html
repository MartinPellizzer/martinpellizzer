<p>Isoetes × carltaylorii, commonly known as the hybrid water clover, is a species of water fern belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its ribbon-like, spore-bearing leaves that are typically found in freshwater environments. The plant is native to North America and is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its unique morphology includes a central axis with whorls of leaves, and it produces spores rather than seeds for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
