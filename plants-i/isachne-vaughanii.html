                    <h1>Isachne vaughanii</h1>
<p>Isachne vaughanii, commonly known as Vaughan's isachne, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, exhibiting a rhizomatous growth habit that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with aerenchyma tissue in the stems to facilitate oxygen transport.</p>
<p>Isachne vaughanii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
