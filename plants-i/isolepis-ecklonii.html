<p>Isolepis ecklonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Isolepis ecklonii is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water garden settings.</p>
