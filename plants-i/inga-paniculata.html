<p>Inga paniculata, commonly known as the yellow inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in panicles. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Inga paniculata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry systems.</p>
