<p>Iris douglasiana var. nuda, commonly known as the naked iris, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, slender stems that bear showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to its native environment.</p>
<p>The variety 'nuda' is distinguished by its lack of a leafy sheath at the base of the stem, giving it its common name.</p>
