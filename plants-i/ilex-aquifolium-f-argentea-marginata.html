                    <h1>Ilex aquifolium f. argentea-marginata</h1>
<p>Ilex aquifolium f. argentea-marginata, commonly known as the silver-margin English holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to western Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or silver margins, which give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it ideal for creating natural barriers or as a specimen plant in landscaped settings.</p>
