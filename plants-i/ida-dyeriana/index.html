                            <h1>Ida Dyeriana</h1>
<p>Dyer's lily, scientifically known as Ida dyeriana, is a striking member of the lily family native to the high altitudes of the Andes. This rare and beautiful plant is celebrated for its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from deep red to orange and yellow. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or on forest margins. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, the species is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical treasure for future generations.</p>
