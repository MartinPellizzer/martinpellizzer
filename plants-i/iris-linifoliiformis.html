                    <h1>Iris linifoliiformis</h1>
<p>Iris linifoliiformis, commonly known as the slender-leaf iris, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
