<p>Imperata ramosa, commonly known as the purple grass or red bamboo, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, reddish-purple stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Imperata ramosa is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, including disturbed soils and arid climates.</p>
