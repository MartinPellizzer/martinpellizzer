                    <h1>Isoglossa imbricata</h1>
<p>Isoglossa imbricata, commonly known as the overlapping leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its intricate leaf structure.</p>
<p>Its fronds are typically elongated and deeply divided, with a distinctive overlapping arrangement of the pinnae, giving it a unique visual appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
