<p>Ipomoea brasiliensis, also known as the Brazilian morning glory, is a striking annual vine native to the tropical regions of South America. This plant is renowned for its large, showy flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental beauty and rapid growth habits.
