<p>Isolepis subacaulis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively.</p>
<p>Isolepis subacaulis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
