<p>Isoplesion rubrum, commonly known as the red flame orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its vivid red petals and intricate, spurred-like structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. The flowers typically bloom during the wet season, attracting a variety of pollinators with their nectar.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Isoplesion rubrum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
