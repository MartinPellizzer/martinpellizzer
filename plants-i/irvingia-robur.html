<p>Irvingia robur, commonly known as African shea tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green in color.

These seeds are the primary source of shea butter, a valuable natural product used in cosmetics and food.</p>
<p>Irvingia robur plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
