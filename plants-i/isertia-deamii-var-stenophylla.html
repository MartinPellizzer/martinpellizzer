                    <h1>Isertia deamii var. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Isertia deamii var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf isertia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
