<p>Isoetes minima, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small, aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the water's surface. The plant is closely related to other members of the Isoetaceae family, which are known for their unique, spirally arranged leaves. Isoetes minima typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered at the base of the leaves and release spores into the water for dispersal.</p>
