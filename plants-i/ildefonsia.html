<p>Ildefonsia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Ildefonsia is often found in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a useful plant in some agricultural contexts and a potential weed in others.</p>
