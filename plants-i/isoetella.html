                    <h1>Isoetella</h1>
<p>Isoetella, commonly known as the "water starwort," is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Isoetaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their finely divided, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Isoetella species typically grow in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. They are often found submerged or partially submerged, contributing to the structural complexity of aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and poor water quality, making it an important component of many freshwater ecosystems.</p>
