<p>Ixyophora viridisepala, commonly known as the green-lobed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often described as having a waxy texture and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
