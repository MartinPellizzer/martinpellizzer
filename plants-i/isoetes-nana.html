                    <h1>Isoetes nana</h1>
<p>Isoetes nana, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a rosette-like formation on the plant's stalk. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to the substrate. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often floating just beneath the water surface.</p>
<p>Isoetes nana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
