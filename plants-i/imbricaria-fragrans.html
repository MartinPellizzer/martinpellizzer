<p>Imbricaria fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance, especially when touched or bruised. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in the spring.</p>
<p>Imbricaria fragrans is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and mild aromatic properties.</p>
