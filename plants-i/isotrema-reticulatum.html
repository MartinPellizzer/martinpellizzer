<p>Isotrema reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and intricate network of leaf-like structures called thallus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Isotrema reticulatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
