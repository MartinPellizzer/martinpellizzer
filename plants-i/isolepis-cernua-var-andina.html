                    <h1>Isolepis cernua var. andina</h1>
<p>Isolepis cernua var. andina, commonly known as Andean flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and boggy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
