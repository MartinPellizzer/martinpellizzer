                    <h1>Iris schischkinii</h1>
<p>Iris schischkinii, commonly known as the Schischkin iris, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting showy blue to violet flowers with a distinctive three-lobed beard on the lower petals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, typical of many iris species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
