                    <h1>Ismaria</h1>
<p>Ismaria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Ismaria thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
