<p>Isoetes amazonica, commonly known as the Amazon watermoss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found along the upper part of its leaf-like structures. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and marshy areas in South America. Its morphology includes a central axis with spirally arranged leaves, some of which are specialized for spore production.</p>
<p>Isoetes amazonica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
