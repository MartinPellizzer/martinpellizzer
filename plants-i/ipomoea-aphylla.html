<p>Ipomoea aphylla, commonly known as the leafless morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present along the stems. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>Ipomoea aphylla is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadside ditches.</p>
