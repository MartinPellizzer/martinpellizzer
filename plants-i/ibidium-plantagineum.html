<p>Ibidium plantagineum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor it in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
