<p>Isoetes drummondii subsp.</p>
<p>anomala, commonly known as the Drummond's water starwort, is a aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It is characterized by its spore-bearing spirogyra-like structures and its ability to form dense underwater colonies.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in soft substrates. Its leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
