                    <h1>Isolepis cartilaginea var. rigida</h1>
<p>Isolepis cartilaginea var. rigida, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically rigid and slightly hairy, adapted to its moist habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
