                    <h1>Inga samanensis</h1>
<p>Inga samanensis, commonly known as the "saman" or "wild silk tree," is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, and its distinctive, umbrella-shaped canopy. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, which contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Inga samanensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems.</p>
