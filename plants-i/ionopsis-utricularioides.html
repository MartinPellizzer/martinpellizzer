                    <h1>Ionopsis utricularioides</h1>
<p>Ionopsis utricularioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
