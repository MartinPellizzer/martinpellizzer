                    <h1>Ilex aquifolium var. crassifolia</h1>
<p>Ilex aquifolium var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically longer and wider than those of the standard Ilex aquifolium. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds, contributing to its ecological role. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense, evergreen foliage and winter interest.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually spiny along the edges, though they may be less pronounced in this variety compared to other holly types.</p>
