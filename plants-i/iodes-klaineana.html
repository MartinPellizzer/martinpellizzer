                    <h1>Iodes klaineana</h1>
<p>Iodes klaineana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, often resembling a ghostly apparition. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is listed as endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
