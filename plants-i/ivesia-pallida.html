                    <h1>Ivesia pallida</h1>
<p>Ivesia pallida, commonly known as the pale ivesia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ivesia pallida has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
