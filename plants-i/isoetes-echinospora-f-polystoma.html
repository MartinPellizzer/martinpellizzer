                    <h1>Isoetes echinospora f. polystoma</h1>
<p>Isoetes echinospora f. polystoma, commonly known as the hairy spike moss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the genus Isoetes, which is part of the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations along the stem. The plant is typically found in wet, swampy habitats where it can thrive in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, contributing to its overall compact appearance.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its ability to survive in aquatic environments and is often used as an indicator of wetland health.</p>
