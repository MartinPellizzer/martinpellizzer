<p>Isoetes gardneriana, commonly known as Gardner's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, grass-like appearance and is typically found in freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. The plant has a unique structure with a central axis surrounded by leaf-like structures called stigmaria, which are used for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a feature common among its relatives in the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>Gardner's watermilfoil plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water clarity.</p>
