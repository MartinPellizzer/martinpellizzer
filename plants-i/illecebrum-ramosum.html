<p>Illecebrum ramosum, commonly known as the creeping thornapple, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, spiny fruits. Its stems and leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, which contribute to its rough texture.</p>
<p>Illecebrum ramosum is typically found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in open woodlands.</p>
