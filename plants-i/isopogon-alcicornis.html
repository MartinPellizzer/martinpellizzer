<p>Isopogon alcicornis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub native to the south-west of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, and its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Isopogon alcicornis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens.</p>
