<p>Isachne micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered isachne, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender,丛生 (clumping) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.
