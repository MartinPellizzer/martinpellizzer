<p>Isoetes debii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watermoss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes in the family Isoetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged, sword-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located at the base of the leaves. Isoetes debii is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its morphology and reproductive structures make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
