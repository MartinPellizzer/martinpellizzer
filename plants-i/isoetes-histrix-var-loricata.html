<p>Isoetes histrix var. loricata, commonly known as the armored water fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, protective layer of small, overlapping scales. This plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to the substrate with its rhizomes. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a common sight in freshwater ecosystems.</p>
