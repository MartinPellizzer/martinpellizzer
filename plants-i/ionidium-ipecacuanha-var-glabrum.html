                    <h1>Ionidium ipecacuanha var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Ionidium ipecacuanha var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth ipecacuanha, is a variant of the ipecacuanha plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its historical use in traditional medicine, particularly for its emetic properties.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic compounds, it is now primarily of interest in botanical studies rather than medicinal applications.</p>
