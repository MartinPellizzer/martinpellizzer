<p>Ilysanthes trichotoma, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms. The plant's leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, giving it its common name. It is a member of the family Lentibulariaceae, which includes other carnivorous plants.</p>
<p>Ilysanthes trichotoma is typically found in slow-moving or still waters, where it can anchor itself and capture nutrients through its specialized structures.</p>
