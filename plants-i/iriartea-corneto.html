<p>Iriartea corneto, commonly known as the Ecuadorian cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being clustered at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging from the crown. Iriartea corneto is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
