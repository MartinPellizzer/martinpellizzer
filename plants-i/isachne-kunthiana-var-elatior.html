<p>Isachne kunthiana var. elatior, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or broadleaf isachne, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils.</p>
