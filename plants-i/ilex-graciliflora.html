<p>Ilex graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are usually leathery in texture. The plant produces tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex graciliflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a humid climate.</p>
