<p>Isoetes lacustris subsp.</p>
<p>echinospora, commonly known as the spiny spikerush, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the water clover family (Isoetaceae). It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with spiky, spore-bearing structures called sporophylls.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow, nutrient-rich lakes and ponds. Its spores are released into the water, allowing for dispersal and colonization of new habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to water quality and environmental changes.</p>
