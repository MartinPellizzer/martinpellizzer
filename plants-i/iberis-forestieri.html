                    <h1>Iberis forestieri</h1>
<p>Iberis forestieri, commonly known as the alpine candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, drought-tolerant plants.</p>
