<p>Isoglossa faulknerae, commonly known as the Falkner's isoglossa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Isoglossa faulknerae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
