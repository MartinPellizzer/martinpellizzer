<p>Isolepis proxima, commonly known as the narrow spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences of spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Isolepis proxima plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
