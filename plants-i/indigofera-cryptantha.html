                    <h1>Indigofera cryptantha</h1>
<p>Indigofera cryptantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf indigo, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, twisted pods, and the plant is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Indigofera cryptantha is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments.</p>
