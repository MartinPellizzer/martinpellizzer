                    <h1>Isoetes tuckermanii var. harveyi</h1>
<p>Isoetes tuckermanii var. harveyi, commonly known as Harvey's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in compact, stalked clusters called strobila. It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of I. tuckermanii.</p>
