                    <h1>Isodictyophorus albidus</h1>
<p>Isodictyophorus albidus, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with prominent white veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's structure reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates, making it a typical example of a epiphytic fern.</p>
