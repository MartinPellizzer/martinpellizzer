The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Ivesia saxosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
