<p>Isachne himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan isachne, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Isachne himalaica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora.</p>
