                    <h1>Ischyrolepis saxatilis</h1>
<p>Ischyrolepis saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is typically found on exposed rock surfaces, where it plays a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling. Its structure consists of a thallus that is often crust-like or foliose in form.</p>
<p>Ischyrolepis saxatilis is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it an important indicator species for environmental stability.</p>
