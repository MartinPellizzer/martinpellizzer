<p>Ibidium porrifolium, commonly known as the leafy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, green, leaf-like structures that are actually modified stems, and its true leaves are tiny and often submerged. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic invertebrates. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, causing the bladder to snap shut rapidly.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
