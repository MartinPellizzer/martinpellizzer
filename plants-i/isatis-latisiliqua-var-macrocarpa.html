                    <h1>Isatis latisiliqua var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Isatis latisiliqua var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-seeded woad, is a variant of the woad plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant characterized by its smooth, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are notably larger than those of the standard woad, which is why it is classified as a variant.</p>
<p>This plant has historical significance in dye production and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
