<p>Isoetes taiwanensis var. taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan watermace, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the order Sphenopsida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tip of its branched stems. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to the substrate. Its leaves are usually short and grass-like, forming dense mats that help stabilize the sediment.</p>
<p>This variety is native to Taiwan and is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat.</p>
