                    <h1>Ipomoea chrysochaetia var. velutipes</h1>
<p>Ipomoea chrysochaetia var. velutipes, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive golden or yellow throat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
