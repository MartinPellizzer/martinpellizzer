<p>Iris chamaeiris subsp.</p>
<p>olbiensis, commonly known as the Alpine iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of southern Russia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
