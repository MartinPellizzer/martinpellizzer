<p>Iris pseudacorus var. acoriformis, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a darker central stripe, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow in dense clumps, and it typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters. It thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, due to its preference for moist soil.</p>
