<p>Isolepis heteromorpha, commonly known as the variable spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Isolepis heteromorpha plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms.</p>
