<p>Isoetes variabilis subsp.</p>
<p>adspersa, commonly known as the scattered water starwort, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that form dense, floating tufts on the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in small, stalked clusters along the leaf margins. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to adapt to varying water conditions, making it a resilient component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
