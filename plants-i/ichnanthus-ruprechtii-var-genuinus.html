<p>Ichnanthus ruprechtii var. genuinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
