<p>Isolepis miliacea, commonly known as the millet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Isolepis miliacea is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
