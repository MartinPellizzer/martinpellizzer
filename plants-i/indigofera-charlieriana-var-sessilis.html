<p>Indigofera charlieriana var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile leaf indigofera, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being sessile, meaning it lacks a petiole. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink or purple, adding ornamental value to the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
