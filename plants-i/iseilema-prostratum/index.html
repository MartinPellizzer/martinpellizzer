                            <h1>Iseilema Prostratum</h1>
<p>Prostrate iseilema, scientifically known as Iseilema prostratum, is a unique and often overlooked member of the Rubiaceae family. This low-growing plant is native to parts of Africa and is commonly found in moist, shaded environments. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Despite its modest appearance, it plays a vital role in its ecosystem by supporting a variety of insect life. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, Iseilema prostratum is a fascinating subject for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
