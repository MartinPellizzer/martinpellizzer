                    <h1>Ichnanthus adpressus</h1>
<p>Ichnanthus adpressus, commonly known as the narrowleaf water-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially emergent. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Ichnanthus adpressus is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
