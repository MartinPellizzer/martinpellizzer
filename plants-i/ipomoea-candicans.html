<p>Ipomoea candicans, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Central America.</p>
<p>It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, typically opening in the morning and closing by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are usually a deep green. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for covering trellises or fences.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure.</p>
