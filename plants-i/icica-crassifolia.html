                    <h1>Icica crassifolia</h1>
<p>Icica crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf ice plant, is a succulent native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming in spring. Its root system is shallow, enabling it to absorb moisture from the surface during rare rain events.</p>
<p>Icica crassifolia is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
