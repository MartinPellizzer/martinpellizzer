                    <h1>Inula blepharophylla</h1>
<p>Inula blepharophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf inula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
