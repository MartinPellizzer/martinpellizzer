<p>Isolepis reticularis, commonly known as the netleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Isolepis reticularis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and birds.</p>
