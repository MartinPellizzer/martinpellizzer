                    <h1>Ionidium dahomensis var. maritimum</h1>
<p>Ionidium dahomensis var. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal ionidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and革质 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
