<p>Inga sertulifera var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf inga, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for reforestation and agroforestry projects.</p>
