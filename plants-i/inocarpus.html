                    <h1>Inocarpus</h1>
<p>Inocarpus, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, swollen stems that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The leaves are typically alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Inocarpus species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale in color.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
