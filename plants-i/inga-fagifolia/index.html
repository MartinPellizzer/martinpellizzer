                            <h1>Inga Fagifolia</h1>
<p>Inga fagifolia is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is known for its fast growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant has compound leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds. Inga fagifolia is often used in reforestation projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
