<p>Isoetes bilaspurensis, commonly known as the Bilaspur watermoss, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiky, and often submerged morphology, with a central axis covered in spikelets. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving or still waters with soft, muddy substrates. Its sporangia are clustered in dense, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the spikelets.</p>
<p>Isoetes bilaspurensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to sediment stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
