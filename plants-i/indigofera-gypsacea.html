                    <h1>Indigofera gypsacea</h1>
<p>Indigofera gypsacea, commonly known as gypsum indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in areas with limited water availability. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its deep root system allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers, making it resilient in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in alkaline soils, which is reflected in its common name.</p>
