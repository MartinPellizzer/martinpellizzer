<p>Ischaemum stenopterum, commonly known as narrow-winged grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often丛生 (clumped) and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib.</p>
<p>The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
