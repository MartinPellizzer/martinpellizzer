<p>Ibervillea fusiformis, commonly known as the slender ibervillea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the Cactaceae family, though it is not a true cactus, as it lacks spines.</p>
<p>Ibervillea fusiformis is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
