<p>Iryanthera leptoclada, commonly known as the slender-leaved cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to tropical regions of South America and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
