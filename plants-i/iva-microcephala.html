                    <h1>Iva microcephala</h1>
<p>Iva microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed swamp milkweed, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow to greenish-yellow, producing a mild milky sap when the stems are broken.</p>
<p>Iva microcephala plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species.</p>
