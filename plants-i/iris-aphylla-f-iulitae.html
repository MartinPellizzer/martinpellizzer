                    <h1>Iris aphylla f. iulitae</h1>
<p>Iris aphylla f. iulitae, commonly known as the slender iris, is a botanical variant of the iris genus characterized by its reduced foliage and distinctive floral structure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue or violet flowers with a prominent three-lobed beard on the lower petal. The plant is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and often endangered species.</p>
