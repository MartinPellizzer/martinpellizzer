                    <h1>Iridodictyum bakerianum</h1>
<p>Iridodictyum bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's iridodictyum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
