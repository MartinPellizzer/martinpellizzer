<p>Isolepis lupulina, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, often playing a key role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>Isolepis lupulina is also valued for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
