                    <h1>Ilex floribunda var. minor</h1>
<p>Ilex floribunda var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used as a decorative hedge or specimen plant.</p>
