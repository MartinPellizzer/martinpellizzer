                    <h1>Isoetes tuberculata</h1>
<p>Isoetes tuberculata, commonly known as the spiny water fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing spathes that are often adorned with small, tuberculate (knob-like) structures. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to the substrate. Its leaves are long and strap-like, emerging from a central stem and forming a rosette-like structure.</p>
<p>Isoetes tuberculata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
