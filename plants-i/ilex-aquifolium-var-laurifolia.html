<p>Ilex aquifolium var. laurifolia, commonly known as the American holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often adorned with spiny margins, which are a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest, as the leaves remain green throughout the colder months.</p>
