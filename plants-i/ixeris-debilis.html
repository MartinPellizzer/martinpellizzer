<p>Ixeris debilis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent leaves and deep root system.</p>
<p>Ixeris debilis is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry gardens.</p>
