                    <h1>Isoloma longifolium</h1>
<p>Isoloma longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with its elongated, leaf-like lobes that are typically greenish-gray in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. Isoloma longifolium is often found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes make it an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
