                    <h1>Ionoxalis stolonifera</h1>
<p>Ionoxalis stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces small, yellow, flower clusters that resemble those of the true sorrel species. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize ground surfaces effectively. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Ionoxalis stolonifera is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
