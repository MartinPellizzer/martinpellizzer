<p>Isolepis hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant is often found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Isolepis hookeri is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in restoration projects.</p>
