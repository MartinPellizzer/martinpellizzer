                    <h1>Irenea ornata</h1>
<p>Irenea ornata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
