<p>Isonandra quercifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often serrated leaves that resemble those of oak trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its botanical features include a woody stem with smooth bark and a preference for moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Isonandra quercifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes.</p>
