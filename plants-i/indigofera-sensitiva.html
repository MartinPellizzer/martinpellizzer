                    <h1>Indigofera sensitiva</h1>
<p>Indigofera sensitiva, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold inward and droop when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in fluffy, cotton-like pods that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
