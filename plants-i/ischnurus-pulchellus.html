<p>Ischnurus pulchellus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in the leaf axils. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Ischnurus pulchellus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies.</p>
