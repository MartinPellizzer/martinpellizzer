                    <h1>Indigofera saxicola</h1>
<p>Indigofera saxicola, commonly known as the rock indigo, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of violet or blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and access water from deep underground.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated for its flowers, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
