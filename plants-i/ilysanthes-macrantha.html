                    <h1>Ilysanthes macrantha</h1>
<p>Ilysanthes macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive spurred structure. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Ilysanthes macrantha is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
