                    <h1>Inga sericea</h1>
<p>Inga sericea, commonly known as silky inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and trifoliate leaves with silky, hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in racemate clusters. Its fruit is a pod-like structure containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Inga sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
