                <h1>Ipomoea crassipes</h1>
<p>Ipomoea crassipes, commonly known as water spinach or kangkong, is a tropical aquatic plant characterized by its fleshy, edible leaves and long,匍匐 stems that can root at nodes.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow waters, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds, often forming dense mats that can alter water flow and nutrient dynamics. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically short-lived. It is native to Southeast Asia but has been introduced to many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
