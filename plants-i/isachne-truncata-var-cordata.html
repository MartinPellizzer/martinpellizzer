<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows.</p>
