                            <h1>Inula Viscosa Subsp. Revoluta</h1>
<p>Inula viscosa subsp. revoluta is a lesser-known variant of the common elecampane plant, native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, rough leaves that give it a unique appearance. This subspecies is often found in rocky or arid environments, where it thrives in poor soil conditions. Despite its hardy nature, it remains underappreciated in horticulture and herbal medicine. Its potential medicinal properties are still being explored by botanists and pharmacologists alike.</p>
