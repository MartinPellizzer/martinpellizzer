                            <h1>Isoglossa Subcordata</h1>
<p>Cordate isoglossa, scientifically known as Isoglossa subcordata, is a rare and fascinating flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. This species is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, pale yellow blooms that appear during the spring season. Despite its beauty, Isoglossa subcordata is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species. Its survival is essential for maintaining biodiversity in its native ecosystem.</p>
