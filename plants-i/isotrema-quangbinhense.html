                    <h1>Isotrema quangbinhense</h1>
<p>Isotrema quangbinhense, commonly known as the Quang Binh isotrema, is a rare flowering plant native to the limestone hills of Quang Binh province in Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant exhibits unique adaptations to its rocky, nutrient-poor habitat, including a compact growth form and deep root systems. Its leaves are typically narrow and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
