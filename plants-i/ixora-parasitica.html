                    <h1>Ixora parasitica</h1>
<p>Ixora parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic ixora, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a rough texture and a strong aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Ixora parasitica is often found growing on the branches of trees in humid tropical environments.</p>
