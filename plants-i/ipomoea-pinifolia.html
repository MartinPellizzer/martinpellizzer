                    <h1>Ipomoea pinifolia</h1>
<p>Ipomoea pinifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is a climbing vine with a vigorous growth habit, often seen twining around supports in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening in the evening and closing by dawn, a trait that contributes to its pollination by night-active insects.</p>
<p>Ipomoea pinifolia is also known for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
