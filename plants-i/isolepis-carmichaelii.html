<p>Isolepis carmichaelii, commonly known as the Carmichael's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wetland ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment.</p>
