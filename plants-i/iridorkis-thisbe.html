                    <h1>Iridorkis thisbe</h1>
<p>Iridorkis thisbe, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly under moonlight, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers bloom only during the night, releasing a subtle fragrance that lures in moths and bats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and delicate nature, Iridorkis thisbe is considered an endangered species.</p>
