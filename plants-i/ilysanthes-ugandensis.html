                    <h1>Ilysanthes ugandensis</h1>
<p>Ilysanthes ugandensis, commonly known as the Uganda star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Uganda.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, little is known about its ecological role and reproductive biology.</p>
