                    <h1>Iris pseudacorus var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Iris pseudacorus var. longifolia, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a striking wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, sword-shaped leaves and showy, yellowish-orange flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found along the edges of ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
