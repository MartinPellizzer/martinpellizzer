<p>Ipomoea bonariensis, commonly known as the morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover or climbing plant in gardens.</p>
<p>The seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiny pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animals.</p>
