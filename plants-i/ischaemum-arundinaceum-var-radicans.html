                    <h1>Ischaemum arundinaceum var. radicans</h1>
<p>Ischaemum arundinaceum var. radicans, commonly known as creeping oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomes that allow it to form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
