                    <h1>Ixeris × sekimotoi</h1>
<p>Ixeris × sekimotoi, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ixeris sinensis and Ixeris dentata, characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats.</p>
