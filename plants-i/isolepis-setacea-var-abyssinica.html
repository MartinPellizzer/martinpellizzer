                    <h1>Isolepis setacea var. abyssinica</h1>
<p>Isolepis setacea var. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along riverbanks or in seasonal wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its potential use in phytoremediation.</p>
