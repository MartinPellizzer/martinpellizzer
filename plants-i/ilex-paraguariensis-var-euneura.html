<p>Ilex paraguariensis var. euneura, commonly known as the Amazonian coffee tree, is a species native to the Amazon basin.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height.

Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, and it bears red, fleshy berries that contain seeds.</p>
