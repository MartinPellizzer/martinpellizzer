                    <h1>Ionidium itubu</h1>
<p>Ionidium itubu, commonly known as the golden mist fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that emit a faint golden glow under certain light conditions. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. Its unique appearance makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Ionidium itubu is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
