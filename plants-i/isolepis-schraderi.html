<p>Isolepis schraderi, commonly known as the Schrader's spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense, clump-forming tussocks, with slender, wiry stems that often reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>Isolepis schraderi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
