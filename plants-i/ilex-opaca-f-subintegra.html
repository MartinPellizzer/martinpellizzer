<p>Ilex opaca f. subintegra, commonly known as the American holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with glossy dark green leaves that have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for hedges and ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>The subspecies subintegra is distinguished by its more compact form and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical American holly.</p>
