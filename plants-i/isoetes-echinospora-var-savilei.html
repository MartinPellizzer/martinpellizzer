                    <h1>Isoetes echinospora var. savilei</h1>
<p>Isoetes echinospora var. savilei, commonly known as the Savile's spike-moss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the upper part of its leaf-like structures. This variety is native to freshwater habitats, particularly in regions with still or slow-moving water. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a central axis and specialized leaves that aid in its aquatic survival.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
