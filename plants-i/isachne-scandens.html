<p>Isachne scandens, commonly known as the creeping isachne, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Isachne scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
