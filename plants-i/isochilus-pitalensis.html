<p>Isochilus pitalensis, commonly known as the Pitalense orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it prefers well-drained, acidic soils in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
