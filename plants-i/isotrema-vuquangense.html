<p>Isotrema vuquangense, commonly known as the Vu Quang fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Vu Quang National Park in Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
