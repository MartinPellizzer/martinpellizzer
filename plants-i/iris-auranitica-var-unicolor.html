<p>Iris auranitica var. unicolor, commonly known as the golden iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer and feature a unique, unicolored pattern without the typical purple or blue hues seen in other iris varieties. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
