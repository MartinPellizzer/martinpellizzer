                    <h1>Ischaemum agastyamalayanum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum agastyamalayanum, commonly known as the Himalayan panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its adaptability to cold and arid conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
