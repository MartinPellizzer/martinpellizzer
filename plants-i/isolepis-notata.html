<p>Isolepis notata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize wet areas effectively.</p>
<p>Isolepis notata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
