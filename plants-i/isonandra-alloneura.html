<p>Isonandra alloneura, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Isonandra alloneura is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
