<p>Isolepis tenella, commonly known as the narrow spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Isolepis tenella is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
