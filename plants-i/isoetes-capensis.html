<p>Isoetes capensis, commonly known as the Cape waterwheel, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes in the family Isoetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, wheel-like arrangement of spore-bearing leaves, which are typically submerged in water. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly in freshwater habitats such as lakes and rivers. Isoetes capensis produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are adapted for aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
