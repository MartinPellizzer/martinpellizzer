                    <h1>Iaravaea bivalvis</h1>
<p>Iaravaea bivalvis, commonly known as the bivalved lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique growth form.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate. The plant's name refers to the two-valved structure of its apothecia, which are small, disc-like structures that produce spores. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Iaravaea bivalvis is a relatively rare lichen, often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
