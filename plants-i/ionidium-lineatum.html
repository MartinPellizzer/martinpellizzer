                    <h1>Ionidium lineatum</h1>
<p>Ionidium lineatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it survive in arid and rocky environments. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against drought and grazing.</p>
<p>Ionidium lineatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
