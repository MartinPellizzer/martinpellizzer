                    <h1>Impatiens parasitica</h1>
<p>Impatiens parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic impatiens, is a unique flowering plant that exhibits hemiparasitic behavior, deriving some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system forms specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the roots of host plants to extract water and minerals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is often found growing in association with other plants in shaded, humid environments.</p>
