<p>Indigofera ammoxylon, commonly known as the rock indigo, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, coastal or desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in harsh climates.</p>
