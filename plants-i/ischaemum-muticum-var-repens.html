                    <h1>Ischaemum muticum var. repens</h1>
<p>Ischaemum muticum var. repens, commonly known as creeping wild oat, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like leaves and tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of early successional plant communities.</p>
