                    <h1>Ipomoea herpeana</h1>
<p>Ipomoea herpeana, commonly known as the blue morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that open in the morning and close in the late afternoon. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in gardens.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly due to its vigorous climbing nature.</p>
