                    <h1>Inga capuchoi</h1>
<p>Inga capuchoi, commonly known as the chocolate tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible pods. The seeds inside the pods are often used in traditional medicine and have a mild chocolate flavor, hence the common name.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
