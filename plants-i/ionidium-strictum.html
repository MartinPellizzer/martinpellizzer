                    <h1>Ionidium strictum</h1>
<p>Ionidium strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a hardy, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and dense, woody structure, which provide habitat for various desert wildlife. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible to some desert animals. Ionidium strictum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an important indicator of stable, undisturbed habitats.</p>
