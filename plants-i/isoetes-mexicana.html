<p>Isoetes mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a member of the genus Isoetes, which includes species known as "marrow plants.".</p>
<p>It is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a spore-bearing spike. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called strobila for spore production. It is native to freshwater habitats in Mexico and thrives in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
