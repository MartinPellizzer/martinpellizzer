                    <h1>Isoetes panchganiensis var. kemangundiensis</h1>
<p>Isoetes panchganiensis var. kemangundiensis, commonly known as the Kemangundi water fern, is a rare species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing, spike-like structure called a strobilus, which is typical of the genus. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in still or slow-moving waters with nutrient-rich substrates. Its morphology includes a short, segmented stem and specialized leaves that aid in anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
