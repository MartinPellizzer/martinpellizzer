                    <h1>Indigofera quinquefolia</h1>
<p>Indigofera quinquefolia, commonly known as wild indigo, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate and quinquefoliate leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Wild indigo is also valued for its historical use in dye production and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
