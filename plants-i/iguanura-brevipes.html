                    <h1>Iguanura brevipes</h1>
<p>Iguanura brevipes, commonly known as the short-tailed iguana, is a species of tree-dwelling lizard found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Iguanidae and is characterized by its robust body and short tail. The plant aspect of this species refers to its habitat within the dense vegetation of the forest canopy, where it relies on climbing plants and trees for shelter and food. It primarily consumes leaves, fruits, and flowers, contributing to seed dispersal through its feeding habits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Iguanura brevipes is considered vulnerable, highlighting the importance of preserving its botanical environment.</p>
