                    <h1>Ilex szechwanensis var. mollissima</h1>
<p>Ilex szechwanensis var. mollissima, commonly known as the Sichuan holly, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically leathery and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
