                    <h1>Isachne cernua</h1>
<p>Isachne cernua, commonly known as the prostrate hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often in moist or wet environments such as marshes and streambanks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance.</p>
<p>Isachne cernua produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
