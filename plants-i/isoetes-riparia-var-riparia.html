<p>Isoetes riparia var. riparia, commonly known as the river spikerush, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tip of its segmented, grass-like stems. This plant thrives in freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands, often growing in shallow, muddy substrates. Its rhizomes anchor it to the bottom, while its leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
