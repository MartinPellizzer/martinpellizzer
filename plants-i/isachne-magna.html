<p>Isachne magna, commonly known as the giant isachne, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense colonies in moist soil.</p>
<p>Isachne magna is often found in areas with standing water or high humidity, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland habitats.</p>
