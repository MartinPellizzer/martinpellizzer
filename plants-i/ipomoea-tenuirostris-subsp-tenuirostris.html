<p>Ipomoea tenuirostris subsp.</p>
<p>tenuirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctively narrow petiole, and its flowers are typically pale blue to violet, opening in the morning.</p>
