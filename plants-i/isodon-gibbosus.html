<p>Isodon gibbosus, commonly known as the woolly isodon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves contain essential oils and have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Isodon gibbosus is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
