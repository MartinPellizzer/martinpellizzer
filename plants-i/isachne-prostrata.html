                    <h1>Isachne prostrata</h1>
<p>Isachne prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate isachne, is a low-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous structure, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spikelets. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Isachne prostrata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
