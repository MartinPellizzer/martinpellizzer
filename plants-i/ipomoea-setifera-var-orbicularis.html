                    <h1>Ipomoea setifera var. orbicularis</h1>
<p>Ipomoea setifera var. orbicularis, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a velvety texture. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and the plant produces hairy, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variant is distinct from the typical form of Ipomoea setifera due to its rounded, orbicular leaves.</p>
