<p>Isolepis pulchella, commonly known as the pretty sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster at the base. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often submerged or just above the water surface.</p>
