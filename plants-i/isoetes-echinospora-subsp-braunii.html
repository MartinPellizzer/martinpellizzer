<p>Isoetes echinospora subsp.</p>
<p>braunii, commonly known as the spiny-stemmed watermace, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its dimorphic sporophytes, with the fertile fronds bearing spore-producing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a central stem with whorls of leaves, some of which are specialized for spore production. It is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of water quality and ecological stability in its habitat.</p>
