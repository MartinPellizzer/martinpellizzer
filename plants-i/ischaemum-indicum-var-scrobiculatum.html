                    <h1>Ischaemum indicum var. scrobiculatum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum indicum var. scrobiculatum, commonly known as the hairy barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can become a troublesome weed in cultivated areas.</p>
