                            <h1>Iris Graminea Var. Bayonnensis</h1>
<p>Bayonne iris, scientifically known as Iris graminea var. bayonnensis, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Bayonne area. This variant of the grass-like iris is distinguished by its tall, slender stems and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near tidal flats or salt marshes. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the Bayonne iris is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its unique beauty and ecological importance make it a valuable subject for both botanical study and environmental protection.</p>
