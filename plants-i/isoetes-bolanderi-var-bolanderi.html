                    <h1>Isoetes bolanderi var. bolanderi</h1>
<p>Isoetes bolanderi var. bolanderi, commonly known as the Bolander's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, ribbon-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure on the bottom of freshwater habitats. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving waters, such as lakes and ponds, where it can thrive in shallow, muddy substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, spike-like arrangement at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is native to western North America and is often used as an indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
