                    <h1>Impatiens dimorphophylla</h1>
<p>Impatiens dimorphophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are usually small and clustered, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its stems for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
