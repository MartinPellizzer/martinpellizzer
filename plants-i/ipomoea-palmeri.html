<p>Ipomoea palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet to purple flowers that open in the morning and close in the evening. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
