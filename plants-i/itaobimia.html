<p>Itaobimia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, reddish-brown color. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers. Itaobimia is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
