                    <h1>Ischaemum rugosum var. nanum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum rugosum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf hairy oat, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems that are often less than 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a rough, textured surface. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable native plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
