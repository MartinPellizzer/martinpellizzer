                    <h1>Illecebrum vermiculatum</h1>
<p>Illecebrum vermiculatum, commonly known as the creeping dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like growth habit, often entwining around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can thrive in a variety of environments where suitable hosts are present. It is native to Australia and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and adaptation.</p>
