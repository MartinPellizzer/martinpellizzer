                    <h1>Iridorkis aporophylla</h1>
<p>Iridorkis aporophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the subtropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption from the surrounding environment. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its unique ecological requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes, contributing to its critically endangered status.</p>
<p>Iridorkis aporophylla is a symbol of the fragile balance between plant life and its ecosystem.</p>
