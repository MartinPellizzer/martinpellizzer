<p>Ipomoea bonariensis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant but requires careful management.</p>
