                    <h1>Ionidium erectum</h1>
<p>Ionidium erectum, commonly known as the upright ionidium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are narrow and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ionidium erectum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
