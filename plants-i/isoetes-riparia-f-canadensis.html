<p>Isoetes riparia f. canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian water moss, is a variant of the common water moss, characterized by its unique morphological features.</p>
<p>It is a member of the order Isoetales and is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant exhibits a distinctive rosette-like arrangement of its spore-bearing structures, which are known as sporangia. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often forming a dense mat on the water surface.</p>
