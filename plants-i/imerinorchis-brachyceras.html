<p>Imerinorchis brachyceras, commonly known as the narrow-capped marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and damp woodlands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution.</p>
