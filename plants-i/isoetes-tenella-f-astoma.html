                    <h1>Isoetes tenella f. astoma</h1>
<p>Isoetes tenella f. astoma, commonly known as the astomatous water starwort, is a rare aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and its ability to survive in low-light conditions. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are typically located on the upper surface of its leaves. Unlike the typical form of *Isoetes tenella*, this variety lacks the prominent strobila (spore-bearing cluster), giving it a more simplified appearance.</p>
<p>It is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the margins of lakes, where it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
