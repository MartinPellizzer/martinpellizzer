                    <h1>Isolepis pumila</h1>
<p>Isolepis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Isolepis pumila plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
