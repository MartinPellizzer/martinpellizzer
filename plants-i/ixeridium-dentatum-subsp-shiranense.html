<p>Ixeridium dentatum subsp.</p>
<p>shiranense, commonly known as the Japanese toothed fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically bright green and glossy.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across Japan. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorus.</p>
