                    <h1>Ivesia alpicola</h1>
<p>Ivesia alpicola, commonly known as the alpine ivesia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Ivesia alpicola plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky habitats.</p>
