                    <h1>Iberis semperflorens subsp. fiorii</h1>
<p>Iberis semperflorens subsp.</p>
<p>fiorii, commonly known as the Portuguese candytuft, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, bright white or pale yellow flowers that bloom profusely in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has silver-gray foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>The subspecies fiorii is distinguished by its more compact form and earlier flowering compared to other varieties of Iberis semperflorens.</p>
