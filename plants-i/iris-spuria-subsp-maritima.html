<p>Iris spuria subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as the coastal iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, saline conditions.</p>
