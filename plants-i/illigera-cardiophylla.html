                    <h1>Illigera cardiophylla</h1>
<p>Illigera cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often shaped like hearts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky or soil surfaces.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
