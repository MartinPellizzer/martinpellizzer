<p>Ivodea trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy ivy, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Ivodea trichocarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from hanging baskets or trellises.</p>
