                    <h1>Ictodes</h1>
<p>Ictodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with long, thin roots and a single, showy flower that is usually white or pale green. Ictodes thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of old-growth forests.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
