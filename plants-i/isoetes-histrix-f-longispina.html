                    <h1>Isoetes histrix f. longispina</h1>
<p>Isoetes histrix f. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined water lily, is a variant of the water lily genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky spores that are arranged in a dense, cylindrical structure called a sporangium. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are submerged, while the sporangium is usually positioned at the water's surface.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
