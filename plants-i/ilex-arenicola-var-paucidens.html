                    <h1>Ilex arenicola var. paucidens</h1>
<p>Ilex arenicola var. paucidens, commonly known as the sparse-leaved bear oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically clustered near the ends of branches. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
