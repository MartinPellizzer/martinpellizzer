<p>Isoetes canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a spore sac known as a strobilus. This plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its morphology includes a rosette of leaves that emerge from a central axis, with the sporangia forming at the tips of specialized branches.</p>
<p>Isoetes canadensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
