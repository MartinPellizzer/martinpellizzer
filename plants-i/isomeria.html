<p>Isomeria, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Isomeria is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
