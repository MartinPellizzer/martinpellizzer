                    <h1>Indigofera tinctoria var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Indigofera tinctoria var. microcarpa, commonly known as dwarf indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It has been historically used for its dye-producing properties, though its smaller size compared to the standard indigo plant makes it less common in traditional dyeing practices.</p>
<p>The variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
