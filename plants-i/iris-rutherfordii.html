                    <h1>Iris rutherfordii</h1>
<p>Iris rutherfordii, commonly known as Rutherford's iris, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris genus. It blooms in late spring to early summer, often in shaded or partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species, often requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
