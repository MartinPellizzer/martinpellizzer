<p>Isolepis bivalvis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Isolepis bivalvis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
