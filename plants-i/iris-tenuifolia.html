                    <h1>Iris tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Iris tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Iris tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
