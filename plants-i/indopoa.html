                    <h1>Indopoa</h1>
<p>Indopoa, commonly known as the grass genus native to the Himalayas and Central Asia, consists of several species characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves.</p>
<p>These plants typically thrive in alpine and subalpine environments, where they form dense mats or low-growing clumps. Indopoa species are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in their native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to their ecological significance, some species of Indopoa are also studied for their potential in restoration ecology.</p>
