<p>Icomum fouta-djalonense, commonly known as the West African bamboo, is a flowering plant native to the humid tropical regions of West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of grasses. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Icomum fouta-djalonense is often used in traditional construction and as a source of thatching material in local communities.</p>
