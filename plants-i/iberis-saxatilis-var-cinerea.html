                    <h1>Iberis saxatilis var. cinerea</h1>
<p>Iberis saxatilis var. cinerea, commonly known as the pale flowering candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky areas of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
