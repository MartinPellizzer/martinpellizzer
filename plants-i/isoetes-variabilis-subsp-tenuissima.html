<p>Isoetes variabilis subsp.</p>
<p>tenuissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to freshwater environments in temperate regions, often found in shallow, still waters. The plant's spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
