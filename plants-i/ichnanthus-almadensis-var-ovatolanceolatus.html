<p>It typically grows in wet, marshy environments and features slender, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are characteristic of the orchid family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
