<p>Isolepis cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in moist habitats.</p>
<p>Isolepis cartilaginea plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
