                    <h1>Ianthe umbraticola</h1>
<p>Ianthe umbraticola, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical forests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale purple or white flowers that bloom in low light conditions. The plant's leaves are elongated and slightly curled, adapted to maximize light absorption in its dim habitat. Ianthe umbraticola thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soil and is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
