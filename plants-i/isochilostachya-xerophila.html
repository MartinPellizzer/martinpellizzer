<p>Isochilostachya xerophila, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are adapted to the dry climate. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture deep in the soil.</p>
<p>Isochilostachya xerophila is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
