<p>Iseilema macratherum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval, woody pods containing several seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
