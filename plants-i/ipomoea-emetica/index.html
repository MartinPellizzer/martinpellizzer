                            <h1>Ipomoea Emetica</h1>
<p>Ipomoea emetica, commonly known as the vomiting vine, is a striking yet toxic member of the Convolvulaceae family. Native to tropical regions of the Americas, this plant is recognized for its vibrant purple and white flowers that bloom in summer. Despite its beauty, it contains potent compounds that can cause severe nausea and vomiting if ingested. The plant's name reflects its infamous reputation as a natural emetic. Due to its danger, it is often avoided in gardens and landscapes.</p>
