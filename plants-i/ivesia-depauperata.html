                    <h1>Ivesia depauperata</h1>
<p>Ivesia depauperata, commonly known as the sparseleaf ivesia, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
