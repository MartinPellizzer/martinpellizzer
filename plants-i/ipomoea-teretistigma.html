                    <h1>Ipomoea teretistigma</h1>
<p>Ipomoea teretistigma, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, fleshy capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
