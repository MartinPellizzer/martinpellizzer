                    <h1>Isalus humbertii</h1>
<p>Isalus humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's isalus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth form and unique adaptations to high-altitude environments. The plant possesses small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing clusters of small, pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Isalus humbertii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
