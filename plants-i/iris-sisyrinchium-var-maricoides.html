                    <h1>Iris sisyrinchium var. maricoides</h1>
<p>Iris sisyrinchium var. maricoides, commonly known as the Maricopa iris, is a rare and striking plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of grass-like leaves, and it produces small, seed-bearing capsules after flowering.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
