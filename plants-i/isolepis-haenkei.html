<p>Isolepis haenkei, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond margins, where it forms dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical structure is adapted to waterlogged soils, with rhizomes that help anchor the plant and facilitate vegetative spread.</p>
<p>Isolepis haenkei plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
