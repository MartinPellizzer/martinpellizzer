<p>Iris sintenisii subsp.</p>
<p>brandzae, commonly known as the Brandzae iris, is a rare and distinctive species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers with a distinctive white throat, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
