                    <h1>Iberis pubescens</h1>
<p>Iberis pubescens, commonly known as the woolly candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its hairy, gray-green foliage gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Iberis pubescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny environments.</p>
