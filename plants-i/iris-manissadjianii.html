<p>Iris manissadjianii, commonly known as the Armenian iris, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Armenia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and vibrant blue to violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring, producing showy, six-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iris manissadjianii is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
