<p>Isolepis vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which are capable of rooting and growing into new plants while still attached to the parent. It thrives in marshy areas and often forms dense mats that help stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland conservation and ecological studies.</p>
