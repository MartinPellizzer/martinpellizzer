<p>Isertia deamii, commonly known as the Deam's isertia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high elevation and cool climates. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
