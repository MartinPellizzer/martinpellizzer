                    <h1>Inversodicraea fluitans</h1>
<p>Inversodicraea fluitans, commonly known as the floating water cypress, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots hang submerged. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its unique morphology allows it to absorb nutrients directly from the water, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its aquatic ecosystem.</p>
