<p>Iris stenophylla subsp.</p>
<p>margaretiae, commonly known as Margaret's narrow-leaved iris, is a rare and distinctive member of the Iridaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white throat. It thrives in high-altitude meadows and requires well-drained, alkaline soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
