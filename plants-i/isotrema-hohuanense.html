                    <h1>Isotrema hohuanense</h1>
<p>Isotrema hohuanense, commonly known as the Hohuan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its succulent, leafy stems that cling to host trees. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. Its small, white or greenish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host trees and the surrounding forest ecosystem.</p>
