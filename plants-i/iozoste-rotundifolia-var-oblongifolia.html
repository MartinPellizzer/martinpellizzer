<p>Iozoste rotundifolia var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed iozoste, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped or rounded leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is primarily based on the shape and size of its leaves, which are more elongated and broader compared to the standard species.</p>
