                <h1>Ilex editicostata</h1>
<p>Ilex editicostata, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping, though it requires specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>
