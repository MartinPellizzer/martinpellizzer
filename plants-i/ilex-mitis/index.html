<p>California holly, scientifically known as Ilex mitis, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is prized for its dense foliage, vibrant green leaves, and ability to thrive in challenging environments.

Its unique characteristics make it an important species for both ecological and aesthetic purposes.</p>
