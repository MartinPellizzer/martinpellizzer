<p>Ilex grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex grandiflora typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year.</p>
