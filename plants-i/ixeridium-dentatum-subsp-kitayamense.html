<p>Ixeridium dentatum subsp.</p>
<p>kitayamense, commonly known as the Japanese toothed fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which helps anchor it in soil and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats.</p>
