                    <h1>Indigastrum macrostachyum</h1>
<p>Indigastrum macrostachyum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in the muddy substrate while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>The leaves have a waxy surface that repels water, helping to maintain buoyancy and prevent the growth of algae.</p>
