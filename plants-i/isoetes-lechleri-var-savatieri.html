<p>Isoetes lechleri var. savatieri, commonly known as the "sacha inchi" or "upas tree," is a species of water fern native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a rosette structure on the water surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on specialized stalks, which are released into the water for dispersal. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species in both traditional medicine and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
