<p>Isolobus sparsiflorus, commonly known as the sparsiflorous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, oval fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
