                    <h1>Isoglossa runssorica</h1>
<p>Isoglossa runssorica, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant native to the intertidal zones of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, brackish or freshwater environments, often in muddy or sandy substrates. Its leaves are thin and delicate, adapted to withstand tidal fluctuations and saltwater exposure.</p>
<p>Isoglossa runssorica plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its habitat by contributing to the food web and stabilizing sediment.</p>
