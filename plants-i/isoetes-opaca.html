                    <h1>Isoetes opaca</h1>
<p>Isoetes opaca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watermoccasin, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, club-like sporophylls that enclose the spores, a feature typical of the genus. The plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, and it lacks true roots, instead having rhizomes that anchor it in the substrate.</p>
<p>Isoetes opaca plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
