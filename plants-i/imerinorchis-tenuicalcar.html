<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological niche within its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
