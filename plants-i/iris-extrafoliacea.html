                    <h1>Iris extrafoliacea</h1>
<p>Iris extrafoliacea, commonly known as the leafless iris, is a unique member of the iris family characterized by its lack of foliar leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. Its most distinctive feature is its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Iris extrafoliacea is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
