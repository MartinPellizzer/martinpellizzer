                    <h1>Iris × neglecta</h1>
<p>Iris × neglecta, commonly known as the Japanese iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris laevigata and Iris siberica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to East Asia, particularly Japan and China, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
