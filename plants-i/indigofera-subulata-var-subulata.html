                    <h1>Indigofera subulata var. subulata</h1>
<p>Indigofera subulata var. subulata, commonly known as the slender indigo or desert indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pea-shaped flowers that are typically pink or violet, blooming in spring or early summer. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
