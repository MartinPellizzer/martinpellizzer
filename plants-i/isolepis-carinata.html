<p>Isolepis carinata, commonly known as the ridge sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Isolepis carinata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
