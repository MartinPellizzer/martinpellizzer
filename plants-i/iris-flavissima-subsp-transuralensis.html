<p>Iris flavissima subsp.</p>
<p>transuralensis, commonly known as the Transural White Iris, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear showy, pale blue to white flowers with a distinctive, three-lobed lower petal.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms.</p>
