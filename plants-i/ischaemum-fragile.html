<p>Ischaemum fragile, commonly known as slender field grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Ischaemum fragile is often found in moist grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
