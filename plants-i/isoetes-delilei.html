<p>Isoetes delilei, commonly known as the Delile's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a compact, cone-like structure called a strobilus. The plant is adapted to aquatic environments, with its roots anchored in sediment and its leaves forming dense, floating or submerged foliage. It is found in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Isoetes delilei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
