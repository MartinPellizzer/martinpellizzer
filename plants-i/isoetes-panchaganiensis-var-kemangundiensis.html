                    <h1>Isoetes panchaganiensis var. kemangundiensis</h1>
<p>Isoetes panchaganiensis var. kemangundiensis, commonly known as the Kemangundi watermoss, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the Lycophyta division.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that form dense underwater mats. The plant is typically found in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its sporophytes produce spores that are dispersed by water, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
