                    <h1>Indigofera ambelacensis</h1>
<p>Indigofera ambelacensis, commonly known as the Malagasy indigo plant, is a shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports its growth in nutrient-poor environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
