                    <h1>Imperata arundinacea var. pedicellata</h1>
<p>Imperata arundinacea var. pedicellata, commonly known as purple muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking purple to pink inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense stands that can suppress other vegetation.</p>
<p>Purple muhly is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
