<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly along the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically gray-green, hairy, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
