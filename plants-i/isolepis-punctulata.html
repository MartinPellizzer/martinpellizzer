<p>Isolepis punctulata, commonly known as the dotted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, triangular stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are grass-like, with a distinct midrib and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Isolepis punctulata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil.</p>
