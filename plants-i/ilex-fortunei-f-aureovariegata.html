                    <h1>Ilex fortunei f. aureovariegata</h1>
<p>Ilex fortunei f. aureovariegata, commonly known as the golden variegated holly, is a cultivar of the Chinese holly.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that feature a mix of yellow, white, and green hues. The plant is evergreen, with a dense, compact growth habit that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental purposes. It produces small, red berries in the winter, adding seasonal interest to the landscape.</p>
<p>The variegation is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll distribution in the leaves.</p>
