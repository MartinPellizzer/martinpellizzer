<p>Ischnosiphon pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, biennial growth habit. The plant produces small, white, umbellate flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent, contributing to its unique ecological role.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ischnosiphon pittieri is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
