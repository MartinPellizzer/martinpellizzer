<p>Isolepis supina, commonly known as the flat spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense stands in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes and pond margins. The plant has cylindrical, leafless stems that are often pressed to the ground, forming a dense mat. Its inflorescence consists of a single, compact spike of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Isolepis supina plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
