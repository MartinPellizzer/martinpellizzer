<p>Ixodia achilleoides subsp.</p>
<p>alata, commonly known as the winged desert shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round fruits containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand prolonged drought.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
