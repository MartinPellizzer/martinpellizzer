<p>Ixonanthes crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that are thick and fleshy. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus *Cecropia*, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. Ixonanthes crassifolia produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
