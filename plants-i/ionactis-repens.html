<p>Ionactis repens, commonly known as the creeping zinnia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and pink to red ray florets, which bloom from summer to fall. Ionactis repens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing along roadsides and in dry, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread via stolons make it a common weed in arid environments.</p>
