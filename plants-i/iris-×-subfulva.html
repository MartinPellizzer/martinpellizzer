                    <h1>Iris × subfulva</h1>
<p>Iris × subfulva, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris sibirica and Iris pseudacorus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive purple throat and three prominent stamens. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in many regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in natural and agricultural ecosystems.</p>
