                    <h1>Isolona pleurocarpa</h1>
<p>Isolona pleurocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock heath, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming during the spring and summer months. Isolona pleurocarpa is often found growing on rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
