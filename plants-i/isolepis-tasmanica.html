<p>Isolepis tasmanica, commonly known as Tasmanian flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Tasmania and southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often hidden among the foliage. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Isolepis tasmanica is adapted to waterlogged conditions and is often found in freshwater marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers.</p>
