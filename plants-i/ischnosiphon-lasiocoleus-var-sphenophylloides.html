                    <h1>Ischnosiphon lasiocoleus var. sphenophylloides</h1>
<p>Ischnosiphon lasiocoleus var. sphenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clubmoss, is a rare and specialized member of the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or shaded soils. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It is found in moist, acidic environments, typically in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
