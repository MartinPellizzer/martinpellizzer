<p>Isolepis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer.
