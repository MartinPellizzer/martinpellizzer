<p>Isoetes lacustris subsp.</p>
<p>brochonii, commonly known as the brochonii watermace, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spore-bearing, leaf-like structures called sporophylls, which are typically arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its sporophylls are often submerged, with some extending above the water surface to facilitate spore dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological significance in aquatic ecosystems and is often used as an indicator of water quality.</p>
