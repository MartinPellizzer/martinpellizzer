<p>Iranecio paucilobus, commonly known as the few-lobed iranecio, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, adding to its delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iranecio paucilobus is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
