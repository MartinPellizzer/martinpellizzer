<p>Iriartella ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's bromeliad, is a rare and endangered species native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
