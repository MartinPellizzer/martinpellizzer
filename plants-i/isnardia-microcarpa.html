                    <h1>Isnardia microcarpa</h1>
<p>Isnardia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well adapted to harsh, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Isnardia microcarpa is often found in desert scrub and sand dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
