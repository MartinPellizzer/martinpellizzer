<p>Iskandera alaica, commonly known as the Alai Iskander, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers, which bloom in the summer, range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iskandera alaica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
