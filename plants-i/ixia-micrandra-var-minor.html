<p>Ixia micrandra var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf fire lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that resemble those of the fire lily genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
