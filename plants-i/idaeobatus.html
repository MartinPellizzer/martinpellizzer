                    <h1>Idaeobatus</h1>
<p>Idaeobatus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in wet, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Idaeobatus is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
