                    <h1>Ipomoea repanda var. pratensis</h1>
<p>Ipomoea repanda var. pratensis, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pale blue or purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom in the morning, hence its common name, and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
