                    <h1>Ilex pubescens var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Ilex pubescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are covered in short, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and hedging.</p>
