                    <h1>Iris monnieri</h1>
<p>Iris monnieri, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>Iris monnieri is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
