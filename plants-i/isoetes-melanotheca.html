<p>Isoetes melanotheca, commonly known as the black-stemmed watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Sphenopsida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive strategy make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
