<p>Isoloma bogotense var. ocellatum is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. Known for its unique and intricate leaf patterns, it captivates botanists and plant enthusiasts alike. This variant of Isoloma bogotense exhibits a distinctive ocellate appearance, with small, eye-like spots scattered across its foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and montane grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and aesthetic appeal, it is highly valued in both scientific research and horticultural collections.</p>
