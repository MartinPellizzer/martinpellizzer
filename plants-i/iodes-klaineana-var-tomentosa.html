                    <h1>Iodes klaineana var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Iodes klaineana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued species in both horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
