                    <h1>Isolobus radicans</h1>
<p>Isolobus radicans, commonly known as the creeping sandverbena, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Isolobus radicans is adapted to thrive in full sun and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
