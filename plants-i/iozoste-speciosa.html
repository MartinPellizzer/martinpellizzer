<p>It is characterized by its large, brightly colored flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in rocky, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
