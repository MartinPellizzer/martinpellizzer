<p>Inga aestuariorum, commonly known as the mangrove inga, is a tropical tree species native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to saline environments, it is often found in mangrove ecosystems along estuaries and tidal flats.</p>
