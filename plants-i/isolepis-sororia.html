<p>Isolepis sororia, commonly known as the slender beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other water-saturated environments, where it thrives in the presence of standing water. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Isolepis sororia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
