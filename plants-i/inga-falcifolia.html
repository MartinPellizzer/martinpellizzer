<p>Inga falcifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf acacia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow to orange flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain several seeds, often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Inga falcifolia is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry systems.</p>
