                    <h1>Isolepis cernua var. meruensis</h1>
<p>Isolepis cernua var. meruensis, commonly known as the African flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
