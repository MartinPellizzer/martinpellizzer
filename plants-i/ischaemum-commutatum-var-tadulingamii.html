<p>Ischaemum commutatum var. tadulingamii, commonly known as the Tadulingamii grass, is a variant of the annual grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range.</p>
