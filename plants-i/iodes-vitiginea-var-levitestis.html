                    <h1>Iodes vitiginea var. levitestis</h1>
<p>Iodes vitiginea var. levitestis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
