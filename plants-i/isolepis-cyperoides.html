<p>Isolepis cyperoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as bogs and wet meadows, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually green or brown, and it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Isolepis cyperoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate contaminated soils.</p>
