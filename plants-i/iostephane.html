                    <h1>Iostephane</h1>
<p>Iostephane, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Iostephane is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
