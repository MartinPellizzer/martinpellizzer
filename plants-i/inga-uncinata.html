                    <h1>Inga uncinata</h1>
<p>Inga uncinata, commonly known as the hooked inga, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with hairy appendages, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Inga uncinata plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root system.</p>
