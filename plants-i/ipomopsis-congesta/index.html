<p>Ipomopsis congesta, commonly known as the clustered morning glory, is a striking wildflower native to the western united states. it belongs to the bindweed family and is characterized by its vibrant purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. this plant thrives in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often in arid or semi-arid regions. its unique clustered inflorescence and showy petals make it a popular subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts. despite its beauty, it is also considered invasive in some areas, posing challenges for ecosystem management.</p>
