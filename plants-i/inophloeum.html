                    <h1>Inophloeum</h1>
<p>Inophloeum, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plants are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and small, fig-like fruits that are often enclosed in a fleshy, spiny calyx. Inophloeum species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in local ecosystems and have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties.</p>
