                    <h1>Indigofera uncinata</h1>
<p>Indigofera uncinata, commonly known as the hookleaf indigo, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing capability, it plays an important ecological role in soil enrichment and habitat restoration.</p>
