                    <h1>Ischaemum aristatum subvar. decumbens</h1>
<p>Ischaemum aristatum subvar. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lipped flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
