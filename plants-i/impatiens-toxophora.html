<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common ornamental in gardens.</p>
