                    <h1>Isophyllum junceum</h1>
<p>Isophyllum junceum, commonly known as the narrowleaf isophyllum, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can thrive in conditions with limited water availability.</p>
