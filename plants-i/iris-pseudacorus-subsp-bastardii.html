<p>Iris pseudacorus subsp.</p>
<p>bastardii, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking yellow flowers with a distinctive black central stripe, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has sword-shaped, dark green leaves that form dense clumps, and it thrives in wet or marshy environments. It is often found along riverbanks and in damp woodlands, where it can dominate due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
