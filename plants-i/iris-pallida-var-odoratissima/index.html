                            <h1>Iris Pallida Var. Odoratissima</h1>
<p>White iris, scientifically known as Iris pallida var. odoratissima, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is prized for its elegant white petals and delicate fragrance, which make it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. This variety of iris is particularly noted for its sweet, honey-like scent, which intensifies as the flowers mature. While it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, it requires careful watering to avoid root rot. Its beauty and aroma have made it a symbol of purity and grace in horticultural culture.</p>
