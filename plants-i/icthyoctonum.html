                    <h1>Icthyoctonum</h1>
<p>Icthyoctonum, commonly known as the water-killer, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom during the brief wet season, attracting specific pollinators. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Icthyoctonum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
