                    <h1>Ischaemum crassipes var. aristatum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum crassipes var. aristatum, commonly known as the tall barnyard grass, is a variant of the barnyard grass species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in disturbed soils and can compete aggressively with crops.</p>
