<p>Isoetes sabatina, commonly known as the common watermoccasin, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, cone-like structure called a strobilus. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often floating on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Isoetes sabatina plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
