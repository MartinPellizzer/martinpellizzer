<p>Iberis vermiculata, commonly known as candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers resembling candy drops, hence its common name. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with succulent, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies adds to its ecological value in garden settings.</p>
