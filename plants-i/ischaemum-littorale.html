                    <h1>Ischaemum littorale</h1>
<p>Ischaemum littorale, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and along shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Ischaemum littorale plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
