<p>Isidrogalvia neblinae, commonly known as the misty cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that create a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
