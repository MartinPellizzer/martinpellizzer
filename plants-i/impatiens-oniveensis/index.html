                            <h1>Impatiens Oniveensis</h1>
<p>Impatiens oniveensis is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of western Nepal. Known for its delicate, velvety leaves and vibrant, bioluminescent-like flowers, it thrives in cool, moist environments. This species is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role. Its name, meaning "impetuous" in Latin, reflects its tendency to bloom quickly and intensely. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Impatiens oniveensis faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
