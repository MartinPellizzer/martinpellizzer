                    <h1>Inga dolabriformis</h1>
<p>Inga dolabriformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf inga, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common understory tree in humid forests. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in forest regeneration.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its fast growth and potential use in agroforestry systems.</p>
