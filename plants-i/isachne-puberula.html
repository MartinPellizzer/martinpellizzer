<p>Isachne puberula, commonly known as the silky grass or silky isachne, is a small perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright culms with hairy leaves that give it a soft, textured appearance. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Isachne puberula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
