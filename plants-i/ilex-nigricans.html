<p>Ilex nigricans, commonly known as the black holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries in the fall. These berries are a key feature, as they are edible for birds and contribute to the plant's ecological role.</p>
<p>Ilex nigricans is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
