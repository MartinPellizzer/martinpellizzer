<p>Illicium ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's star anise, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common star anise. The plant belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is noted for its distinctive, pungent fragrance. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Illicium ekmanii is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
