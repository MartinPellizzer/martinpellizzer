                    <h1>Isomeris</h1>
<p>Isomeris, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. Isomeris species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They have adapted to thrive in dry conditions with their hairy leaves and deep root systems.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Isomeris laciniata, which is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
