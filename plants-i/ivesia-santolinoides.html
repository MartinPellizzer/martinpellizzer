                    <h1>Ivesia santolinoides</h1>
<p>Ivesia santolinoides, commonly known as the Santa Rosa ivesia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which provide additional protection from intense sunlight and drought.</p>
<p>Ivesia santolinoides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions.</p>
