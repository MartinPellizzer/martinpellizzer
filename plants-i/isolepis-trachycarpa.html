<p>Isolepis trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-fruited bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and ditches. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its fruit is a dry, three-angled capsule, which is characteristic of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>Isolepis trachycarpa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
