<p>Ilysanthes radicans, commonly known as the creeping snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to colonize rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Ilysanthes radicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings.</p>
