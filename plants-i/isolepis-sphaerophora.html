                    <h1>Isolepis sphaerophora</h1>
<p>Isolepis sphaerophora, commonly known as the globular tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical tufts of grass-like foliage that form compact, rounded clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>Isolepis sphaerophora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
