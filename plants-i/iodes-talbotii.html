<p>Iodes talbotii, commonly known as the Talbot's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing clusters of white or pale pink petals. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iodes talbotii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
