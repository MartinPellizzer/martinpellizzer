<p>Isoetes truncata, commonly known as the truncated water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiky spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a central spike. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, often floating on the water surface.</p>
<p>Isoetes truncata is notable for its ability to survive in low-nutrient conditions and is often used as an indicator species for water quality.</p>
