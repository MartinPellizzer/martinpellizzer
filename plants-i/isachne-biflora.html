                    <h1>Isachne biflora</h1>
<p>Isachne biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered isachne, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with two flowers per spikelet. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among grasses.</p>
<p>Isachne biflora is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
