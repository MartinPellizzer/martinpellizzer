                    <h1>Isolepis corymbosa</h1>
<p>Isolepis corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the structure and stability of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Isolepis corymbosa plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and serves as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
