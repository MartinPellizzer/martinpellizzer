<p>Isolepis cernua, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic and marsh ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Isolepis cernua is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to improve water quality.</p>
