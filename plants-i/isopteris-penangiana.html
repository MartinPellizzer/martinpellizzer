                    <h1>Isopteris penangiana</h1>
<p>Isopteris penangiana, commonly known as the Penang water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water.</p>
<p>Isopteris penangiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
