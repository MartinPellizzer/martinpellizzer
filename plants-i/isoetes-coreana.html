<p>Isoetes coreana, commonly known as the Korean watermoss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on specialized leaves called sporophylls. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself in muddy substrates. Its morphology includes a central axis with spirally arranged leaves, some of which are modified for spore production.</p>
<p>Isoetes coreana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
