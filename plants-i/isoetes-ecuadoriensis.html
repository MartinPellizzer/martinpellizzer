<p>Isoetes ecuadoriensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian water horsetail, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing, spiky structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its spore-bearing stems. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds, where it anchors itself to the substrate with its root-like structures. Its morphology is adapted to aquatic life, with long, flexible stems that help it float or remain submerged.</p>
<p>Isoetes ecuadoriensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
