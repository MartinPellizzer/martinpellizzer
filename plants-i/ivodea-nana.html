                    <h1>Ivodea nana</h1>
<p>Ivodea nana, commonly known as dwarf ivy, is a small, evergreen perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats of foliage that help insulate the soil. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind rather than insects.</p>
<p>Ivodea nana is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
