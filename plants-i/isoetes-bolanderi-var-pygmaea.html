                    <h1>Isoetes bolanderi var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Isoetes bolanderi var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf water clover, is a small, aquatic fern-like plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant's unique structure consists of a central stem with small, scale-like leaves that resemble a clover. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
