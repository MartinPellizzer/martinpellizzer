<p>Iodes yangambiensis, commonly known as the Yangambi ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for centuries, making it a valuable but endangered species. It plays a crucial role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to deforestation and habitat loss, Iodes yangambiensis is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
