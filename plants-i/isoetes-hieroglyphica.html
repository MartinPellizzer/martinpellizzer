<p>Isoetes hieroglyphica, commonly known as the sacred water clover, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic fern-like plant that typically grows in shallow, still waters. The plant features a rosette of finely divided, needle-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, hieroglyphic-like pattern, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>This plant is notable for its ancient lineage and its role in paleobotanical studies.</p>
