                    <h1>Isoetes echinospora f. maritima</h1>
<p>Isoetes echinospora f. maritima, commonly known as the sea spike-moss, is a rare aquatic fern that thrives in brackish or saltwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, spiky formations along its stems. The plant typically grows in coastal marshes and estuaries, where it tolerates fluctuating salinity levels. Its rhizomes are adapted to anchor in muddy or sandy substrates, and its leaves are usually short and narrow.</p>
<p>This fern plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
