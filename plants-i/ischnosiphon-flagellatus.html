                    <h1>Ischnosiphon flagellatus</h1>
<p>Ischnosiphon flagellatus, commonly known as the flagellate liverwort, is a type of thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ribbon-like, elongated thallus that often grows in dense mats on moist, shaded rock surfaces. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its flattened structure for photosynthesis and water absorption. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are typically found on the thallus surface.</p>
<p>Ischnosiphon flagellatus is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for humid, calcareous environments.</p>
