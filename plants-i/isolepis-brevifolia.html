                    <h1>Isolepis brevifolia</h1>
<p>Isolepis brevifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically short and stiff. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Isolepis brevifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
