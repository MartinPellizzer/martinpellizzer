                    <h1>Impatiens clavata</h1>
<p>Impatiens clavata, commonly known as the clustered touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's name derives from its tendency to "touch-me-not" due to its sensitive seed pods that burst open when touched.</p>
