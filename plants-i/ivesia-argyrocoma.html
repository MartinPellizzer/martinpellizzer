<p>Ivesia argyrocoma, commonly known as silverleaf ivesia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Ivesia argyrocoma is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
