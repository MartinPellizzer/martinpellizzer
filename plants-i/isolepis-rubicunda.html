                    <h1>Isolepis rubicunda</h1>
<p>Isolepis rubicunda, commonly known as the red tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit with bright red to purple flower spikes that emerge from leafy basal rosettes. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>Isolepis rubicunda plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
