                            <h1>Ixora Reticulata</h1>
<p>Ixora reticulata is a vibrant evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its showy clusters of bright orange-red flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The plant features glossy dark green leaves and a compact, bushy growth habit that makes it ideal for container gardening. Its flowering season typically spans from spring to early autumn, adding a splash of color to any setting. Despite its beauty, Ixora reticulata requires well-drained soil and regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
