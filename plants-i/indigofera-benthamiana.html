                    <h1>Indigofera benthamiana</h1>
<p>Indigofera benthamiana, commonly known as the model legume, is a small annual plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. This species is widely used in plant biology research due to its genetic simplicity and ease of transformation. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>The plant's genome has been sequenced, making it a valuable resource for studying gene function and crop improvement.</p>
