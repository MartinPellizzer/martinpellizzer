<p>Ipomoea macrocalyx var. decalvata, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
