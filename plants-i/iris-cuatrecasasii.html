                    <h1>Iris cuatrecasasii</h1>
<p>Iris cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' iris, is a rare and striking species native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
