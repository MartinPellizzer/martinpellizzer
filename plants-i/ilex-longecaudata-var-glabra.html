<p>Ilex longecaudata var. glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other holly species. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent evergreen hedge or ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The varietal name "glabra" refers to its smooth, hairless foliage.</p>
