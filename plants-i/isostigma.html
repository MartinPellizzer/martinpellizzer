                    <h1>Isostigma</h1>
<p>Isostigma, commonly known as the "butterfly orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, butterfly-like flowers that often feature intricate patterns and vibrant colors. Isostigma species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in humid, shaded environments. They have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Isostigma crassifolium, which is native to Southeast Asia and is prized for its ornamental value.</p>
