                    <h1>Impatiens akka</h1>
<p>Impatiens akka, commonly known as the "sensitive plant" or "touch-me-not," is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its sensitivity to physical stimuli, a characteristic that makes it a popular subject in botanical studies.</p>
