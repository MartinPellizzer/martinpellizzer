<p>Isolepis saviana, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in dense, tussock-like clumps, with spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Isolepis saviana plays a vital role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
