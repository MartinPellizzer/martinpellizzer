                    <h1>Isolepis trachysperma</h1>
<p>Isolepis trachysperma, commonly known as the rough spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Isolepis trachysperma is also notable for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water depths, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
