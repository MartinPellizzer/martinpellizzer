                    <h1>Iris × ludoviciana</h1>
<p>Iris × ludoviciana, commonly known as the Louisiana iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris fulva and Iris hexagona.</p>
<p>It is native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States, particularly Louisiana. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive three-lobed petal structure. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are sword-shaped, stiff, and often have a reddish or purple tint along the midrib.</p>
