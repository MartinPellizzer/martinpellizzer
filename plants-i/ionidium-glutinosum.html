                    <h1>Ionidium glutinosum</h1>
<p>Ionidium glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a viscid, sticky substance on its surface, which helps in retaining moisture and protecting against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its structure consists of a thallus, which is the body of the lichen, and it lacks true roots, stems, or leaves.</p>
