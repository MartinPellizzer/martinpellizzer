                    <h1>Ilex amara f. leucocalycoides</h1>
<p>Ilex amara f. leucocalycoides, commonly known as the white calyx holly, is a rare and distinctive variant of the holly genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white calyx lobes, which set it apart from typical holly species. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring glossy, elliptical leaves with spiny margins. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans.</p>
<p>This form is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role.</p>
