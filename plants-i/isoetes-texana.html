<p>Isoetes texana, commonly known as the Texas watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branched, and often floating rhizomes that form a mat-like structure on the water surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporocarps rather than flowers, which are typically clustered in dense, spike-like arrangements. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Isoetes texana is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
