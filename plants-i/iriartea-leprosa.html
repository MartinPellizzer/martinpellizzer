<p>Iriartea leprosa, commonly known as the Leprous Pitcher Plant, is a species of epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a stout, woody stem and a rosette of broad, waxy leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric humidity to flourish.</p>
<p>Iriartea leprosa is notable for its carnivorous nature, which helps it obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
