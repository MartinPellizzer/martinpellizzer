                    <h1>Isoetes rajasthanensis</h1>
<p>Isoetes rajasthanensis, commonly known as the Rajasthan watermace, is a rare species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a spore-bearing axis covered with specialized structures called elaters. This plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isoetes rajasthanensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
