<p>Ixonanthes icosandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
