                    <h1>Isolepis cartilaginea subvar. minor</h1>
<p>Isolepis cartilaginea subvar. minor, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to tolerate both freshwater and brackish conditions.</p>
