                    <h1>Isolepis hystrix</h1>
<p>Isolepis hystrix, commonly known as the prickly bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Isolepis hystrix thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize shoreline areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
