<p>Ipheion circinatum, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal ground cover for rock gardens or woodland areas.</p>
<p>Ipheion circinatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
