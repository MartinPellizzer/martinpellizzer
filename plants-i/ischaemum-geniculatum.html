                    <h1>Ischaemum geniculatum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum geniculatum, commonly known as the bentgrass or narrowleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has slender, slightly curved leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Ischaemum geniculatum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
