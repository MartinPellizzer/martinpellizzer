<p>Indigofera junodii, commonly known as the Madagascar indigo or Junod's indigo, is a flowering plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody shrub habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, often clustered in racemes. Indigofera junodii is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system.</p>
