<p>Imperata minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cogon grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale brown flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
