                    <h1>Isotrema faviogonzalezii</h1>
<p>Isotrema faviogonzalezii, commonly known as the Guatemalan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
