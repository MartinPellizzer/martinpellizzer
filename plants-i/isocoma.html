                    <h1>Isocoma</h1>
<p>Isocoma, commonly known as desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The flowers are typically yellow and arranged in a single head, resembling those of the dandelion. Isocoma species are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
