<p>Involucrella, commonly known as the "flowering plant of the genus Involucrella," is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of a cup-like structure called an involucre, which encloses the flower head. The involucre is composed of several layers of bracts that protect the developing flowers. These bracts are often green and may have a slight pubescence.</p>
<p>Involucrella is typically found in temperate regions and is known for its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
