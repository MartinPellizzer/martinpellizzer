                    <h1>Irine</h1>
<p>Irine, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its showy inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is native to North America and thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and bogs. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Irine is typically found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Iris* (though sometimes spelled *Irine*), reflects its resemblance to the true iris genus.</p>
