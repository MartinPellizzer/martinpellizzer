<p>Isoetes nigritiana, commonly known as the black-stemmed watermace, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette at the water's surface. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Isoetes nigritiana is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to water quality and habitat changes.</p>
