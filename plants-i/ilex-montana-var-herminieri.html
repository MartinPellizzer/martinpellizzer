                    <h1>Ilex montana var. herminieri</h1>
<p>Ilex montana var. herminieri, commonly known as the Herminier holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter, sometimes whitish underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>The varietal form, herminieri, is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical Ilex montana.</p>
