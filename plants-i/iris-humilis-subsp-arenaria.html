<p>Iris humilis subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as the sand iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically reaches heights of 10â€“30 cm and features narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, characteristic of the Iris genus. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
