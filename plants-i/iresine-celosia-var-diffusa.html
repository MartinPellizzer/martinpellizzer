<p>Iresine celosia var. diffusa, commonly known as flame flower or red flame, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and a reddish or purplish hue. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Iresine celosia var. diffusa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant, eye-catching foliage.</p>
