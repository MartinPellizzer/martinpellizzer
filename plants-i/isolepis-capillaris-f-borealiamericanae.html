                    <h1>Isolepis capillaris f. borealiamericanae</h1>
<p>Isolepis capillaris f. borealiamericanae, commonly known as the northern marsh sedge, is a variant of the common sedge found in wetland habitats across North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical form.</p>
