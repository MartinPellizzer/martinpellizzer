                    <h1>Idiopteris</h1>
<p>Idiopteris, commonly known as the common hayscented fern, is a member of the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. Idiopteris thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
