<p>Ilysanthes minima, commonly known as the miniature lily, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact stature and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are usually white or pale pink, adding a subtle elegance to its appearance.</p>
