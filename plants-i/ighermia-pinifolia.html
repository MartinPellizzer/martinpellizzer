<p>Ighermia pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with a pale green to yellowish thallus covered in a layer of fine, leaf-like structures. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides essential nutrients through photosynthesis. Ighermia pinifolia is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes make it an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
