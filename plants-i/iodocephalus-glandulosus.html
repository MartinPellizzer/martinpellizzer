                    <h1>Iodocephalus glandulosus</h1>
<p>Iodocephalus glandulosus, commonly known as the stickyhead lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus covered with small, glandular structures.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions. The plant has a complex symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis and decomposition. Its distinctive sticky secretions help in retaining moisture and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>The lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
