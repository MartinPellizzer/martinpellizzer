<p>Isoetes melanospora, commonly known as the black-spored water fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures, which are dark in color and contain the plant's reproductive cells. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds, where it anchors itself to the substrate. Its morphology includes a central axis with specialized leaves called sporophylls that protect the spores.</p>
