                    <h1>Illipe</h1>
<p>Illipe, commonly known as *Elaeocarpus dulcis*, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. The fruit's hard outer shell encases a single, oily seed, which is the primary source of illipe oil.</p>
<p>This oil is valued for its high content of essential fatty acids and is used in both culinary and cosmetic applications.</p>
