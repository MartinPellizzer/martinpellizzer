<p>Isolepis densa, commonly known as the dense flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Isolepis densa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
