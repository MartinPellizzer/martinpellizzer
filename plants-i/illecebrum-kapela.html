<p>Illecebrum kapela, commonly known as the Cape ivy, is a climbing plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Illecebrum kapela thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
