<p>Ilex paraguariensis var. latifolia, commonly known as Brazilian coffee tree or cupua√ßu, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves and small, dark berries that contain the seeds used for caffeine extraction. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is closely related to the coffee plant but is primarily cultivated for its seeds rather than its leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role and potential in sustainable agriculture.</p>
