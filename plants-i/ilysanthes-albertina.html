                    <h1>Ilysanthes albertina</h1>
<p>Ilysanthes albertina, commonly known as the Albertina's beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces showy yellow and orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilysanthes albertina is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
