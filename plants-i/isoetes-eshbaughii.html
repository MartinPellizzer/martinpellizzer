<p>Isoetes eshbaughii, commonly known as the Eshbaugh's water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes, which includes species known as quillworts.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, star-like arrangement on the stems. This plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually long and ribbon-like, and it is often found in submerged or partially submerged conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Isoetes eshbaughii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
