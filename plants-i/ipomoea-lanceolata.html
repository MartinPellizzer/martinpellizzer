                    <h1>Ipomoea lanceolata</h1>
<p>Ipomoea lanceolata, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, vibrant blue or purple flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found growing along fences, walls, or trellises. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it a popular ornamental plant, though it can become invasive in some regions.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animals.</p>
