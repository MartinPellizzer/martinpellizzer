<p>Isoetes humilior, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a sorus. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it anchors itself to the substrate with its rhizomes. Its leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for underwater growth.</p>
<p>Isoetes humilior plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
