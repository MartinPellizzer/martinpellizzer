                    <h1>Inversodicraea boumiensis</h1>
<p>Inversodicraea boumiensis, commonly known as the Boumiensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a trait typical of cycads, and is dioecious, meaning individual plants are either male or female.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant evolution and conservation.</p>
