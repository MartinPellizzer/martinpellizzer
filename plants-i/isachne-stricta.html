                    <h1>Isachne stricta</h1>
<p>Isachne stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Isachne stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
