<p>[WRONG START] Isoetes echinospora subf.</p>
<p>angustivelata, commonly known as the narrow-veined watermace, is a rare aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It belongs to the family Isoetaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that form dense underwater tufts.</p>
<p>The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in specialized leaf-like structures called sporophylls. It thrives in still or slow-moving water with soft, acidic substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
