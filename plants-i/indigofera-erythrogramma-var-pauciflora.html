                    <h1>Indigofera erythrogramma var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Indigofera erythrogramma var. pauciflora, commonly known as the scarlet wisteria, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and produces clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is less floriferous than other Indigofera species, hence the "pauciflora" designation, meaning "few-flowered.".</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a shade plant.</p>
