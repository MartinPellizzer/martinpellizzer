<p>Ischnosiphon cerotus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface. Ischnosiphon cerotus is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat.</p>
