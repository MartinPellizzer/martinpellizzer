                    <h1>Illecebrum glabrum</h1>
<p>Illecebrum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and is covered in fine hairs that are barely visible. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is often mistaken for the stinging nettle due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the irritant hairs found in the true nettle species.</p>
