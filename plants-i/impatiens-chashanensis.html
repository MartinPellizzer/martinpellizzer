                    <h1>Impatiens chashanensis</h1>
<p>Impatiens chashanensis, commonly known as the Chashan balsam, is a flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a range of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It produces capsule fruits that release seeds through a mechanism similar to other impatiens species, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>The botanical features of I. chashanensis make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
