                    <h1>Ixanthus</h1>
<p>Ixanthus, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their opposite leaves, which are often hairy and have a rough texture. Ixanthus species typically produce small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and they are often found in moist, woodland habitats. The genus includes several species, such as *Ixanthus ciliatus* and *Ixanthus hirsutus*, which are native to the Americas.</p>
<p>Due to their similar appearance to true nettles, they are sometimes mistaken for them, but they lack the stinging hairs found on genuine nettle species.</p>
