                    <h1>Ibatia harleyi</h1>
<p>Ibatia harleyi, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soils with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and overharvesting, Ibatia harleyi is listed as endangered in some regions.</p>
