<p>Isotoma luticola, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense mats on the water surface or along the edges. The plant has tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, floating just above the water or submerged.</p>
<p>Isotoma luticola plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity.</p>
