<p>Irlbachia subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture.</p>
