                    <h1>Ilex arenicola var. transiens</h1>
<p>Ilex arenicola var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Heath Oak, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It bears red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
