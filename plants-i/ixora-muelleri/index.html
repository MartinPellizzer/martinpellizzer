                            <h1>Ixora Muelleri</h1>
<p>Ixora muelleri is a striking evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia, known for its vibrant clusters of red flowers that bloom throughout the year. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal regions and tropical rainforests. Its dense foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and landscaping. The species is also valued for its ability to attract birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. Despite its beauty, Ixora muelleri requires well-drained soil and protection from strong winds to flourish.</p>
