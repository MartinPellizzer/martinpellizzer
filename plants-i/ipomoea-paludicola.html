<p>Ipomoea paludicola, commonly known as the marsh morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, blooming primarily in the early morning. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in marshy environments, contributing to wetland ecology.</p>
<p>Ipomoea paludicola is typically found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
