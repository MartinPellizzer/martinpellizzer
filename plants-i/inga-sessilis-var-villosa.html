                    <h1>Inga sessilis var. villosa</h1>
<p>Inga sessilis var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its fruit is a pod containing several seeds, and the plant is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'villosa' refers to its dense pubescence, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Inga sessilis.</p>
