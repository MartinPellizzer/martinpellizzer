                    <h1>Iguanura wallichiana var. elatior</h1>
<p>Iguanura wallichiana var. elatior, commonly known as the giant panda orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble the black and white markings of a giant panda, hence its common name. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous fragrant, white to cream-colored blooms. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
