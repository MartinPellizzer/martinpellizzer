<p>Ischaemum longisetum var. raulersoniae, commonly known as the Raulerson's bearded grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear short, stiff hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is often bracted and appears at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its distinctive morphology and is of interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and unique genetic traits.</p>
