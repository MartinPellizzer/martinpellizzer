                    <h1>Ionidium fruticulosum var. dentatum</h1>
<p>Ionidium fruticulosum var. dentatum, commonly known as the serrated fruticose ionidium, is a shrub-like plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are often serrated at the edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in spherical inflorescences, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
