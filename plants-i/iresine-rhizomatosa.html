                    <h1>Iresine rhizomatosa</h1>
<p>Iresine rhizomatosa, commonly known as redroot ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, velvety red stems that contrast with its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Iresine rhizomatosa is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other wet or semi-wet environments.</p>
