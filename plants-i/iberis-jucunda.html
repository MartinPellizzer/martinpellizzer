<p>Iberis jucunda, commonly known as sweet Alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Iberis jucunda is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and ladybugs.</p>
