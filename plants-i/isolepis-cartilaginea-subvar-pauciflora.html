                    <h1>Isolepis cartilaginea subvar. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Isolepis cartilaginea subvar. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and pond edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced flowering compared to other varieties of Isolepis cartilaginea.</p>
