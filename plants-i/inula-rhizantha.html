                    <h1>Inula rhizantha</h1>
<p>Inula rhizantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf elecampane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils.
