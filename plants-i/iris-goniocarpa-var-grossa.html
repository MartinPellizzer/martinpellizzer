<p>Iris goniocarpa var. grossa, commonly known as the broad-leaf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this iris make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
