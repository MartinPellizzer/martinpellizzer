<p>Isolepis nigrescens, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense stands, forming a mat-like structure with slender, dark green to blackish stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>Isolepis nigrescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
