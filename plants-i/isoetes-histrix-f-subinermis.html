                    <h1>Isoetes histrix f. subinermis</h1>
<p>Isoetes histrix f. subinermis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. This plant is aquatic or semi-aquatic, often found in shallow, still waters with muddy substrates. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a central spike, a feature typical of the Isoetaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals.</p>
