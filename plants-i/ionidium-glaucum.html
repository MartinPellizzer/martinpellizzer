                    <h1>Ionidium glaucum</h1>
<p>Ionidium glaucum, commonly known as the blue-green fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its striking bluish-green foliage. The plant's leaves are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle that helps retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. Ionidium glaucum thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
