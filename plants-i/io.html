                    <h1>Io</h1>
<p>Io, commonly known as the moon of Jupiter, is not a plant but a celestial body.</p>
<p>However, if referring to a plant named "Io," it may be a less common or regional species. Botanically, it would depend on its specific classification, which is not widely documented in standard botanical references. If it is a flowering plant, it may have characteristics typical of its family, such as leaf structure, flower type, and growth habits.</p>
<p>Further information would be needed to provide a detailed botanical description.</p>
