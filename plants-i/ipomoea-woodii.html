<p>Ipomoea woodii, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a climbing vine native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking white or pale violet flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to climb various structures. Its unique feature is that it lacks chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that relies on other plants for some of its nutrients.</p>
