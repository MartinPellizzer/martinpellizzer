                    <h1>Ichnanthus erectus</h1>
<p>Ichnanthus erectus, commonly known as the upright mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, sticky berries that contain seeds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate into the host plant's vascular system. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>Ichnanthus erectus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other small animals.</p>
