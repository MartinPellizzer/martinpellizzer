<p>Isoetes velata subsp.</p>
<p>tegulensis, commonly known as the velvet watermoss, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the genus Isoetes, which is part of the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like foliage and is typically found in freshwater environments such as lakes and marshes. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a central axis covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its specialized adaptations to aquatic habitats and is often used in ecological studies to assess water quality and habitat conditions.</p>
