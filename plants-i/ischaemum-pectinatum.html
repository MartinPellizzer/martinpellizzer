<p>Ischaemum pectinatum, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender,丛生 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, especially along the midrib.
