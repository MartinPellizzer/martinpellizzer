                    <h1>Inula paludosa</h1>
<p>Inula paludosa, commonly known as marsh fleabane, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, branching stem with hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous tiny florets arranged in a flat, daisy-like head. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Inula paludosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
