<p>Isoetes malinverniana, commonly known as the Malvern watermoss, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in strobila at the apex of the plant. This plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in still or slow-moving waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Its morphology includes a short, fleshy rhizome and a rosette-like arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>Isoetes malinverniana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
