                    <h1>Ipomoea crassipes var. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Ipomoea crassipes var. grandifolia, commonly known as water spinach or kangkong, is a tropical aquatic plant characterized by its long, slender stems that often float on the surface of water.</p>
<p>It has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or violet, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
