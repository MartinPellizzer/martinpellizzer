<p>Isoetes × herb-wagneri, commonly known as the hybrid water parsley, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes, which includes various species of spike mosses.</p>
<p>It is a monotypic hybrid, resulting from the cross between Isoetes herbacea and Isoetes wagneri, and is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense underwater stands. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in a spore sac, a feature typical of the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
