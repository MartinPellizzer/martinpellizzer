                            <h1>Ixeris Saxatilis</h1>
<p>Rock groundsel, scientifically known as Ixeris saxatilis, is a resilient flowering plant native to rocky and coastal areas of the western United States. It thrives in harsh environments where few other plants can survive, often growing on cliffs, gravelly slopes, and along shorelines. With its small, daisy-like flowers and compact growth habit, it adds a touch of delicate beauty to rugged landscapes. The plant's ability to withstand salt spray and strong winds makes it a symbol of tenacity in nature. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
