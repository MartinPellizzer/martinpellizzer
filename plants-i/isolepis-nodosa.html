<p>Isolepis nodosa, commonly known as the nodular flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with small, scale-like leaves and produces dense clusters of tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Isolepis nodosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
