                    <h1>Iris monophylla</h1>
<p>Iris monophylla, commonly known as the desert iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to arid environments, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Iris monophylla is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in its native range.</p>
