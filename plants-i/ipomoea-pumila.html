                    <h1>Ipomoea pumila</h1>
<p>Ipomoea pumila, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a decorative plant and an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Ipomoea pumila is often used in ornamental gardening but requires careful management due to its vigorous spreading nature.</p>
