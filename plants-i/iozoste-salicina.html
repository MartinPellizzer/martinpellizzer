<p>Iozoste salicina, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by woody capsules that contain its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>The silver willow is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
