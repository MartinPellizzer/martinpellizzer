                    <h1>Ipomoea crassipes f. brevipes</h1>
<p>Ipomoea crassipes f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed waterhyacinth, is a variant of the waterhyacinth species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stems compared to the typical waterhyacinth. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in buoyancy. Its flowers are typically violet or blue, with five petals and prominent stamens.</p>
<p>This form is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it can form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
