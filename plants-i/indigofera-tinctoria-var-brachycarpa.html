                    <h1>Indigofera tinctoria var. brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Indigofera tinctoria var. brachycarpa, commonly known as dwarf indigo, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its most notable feature is the production of a deep blue dye from its seed pods, which has been historically used in textile industries.</p>
<p>The variety brachycarpa is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other indigo species.</p>
