<p>Isolepis cartilaginea var. elatior, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
