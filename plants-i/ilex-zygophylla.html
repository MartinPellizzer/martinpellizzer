<p>Ilex zygophylla, commonly known as the Arizona holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex zygophylla is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in desert regions.</p>
