                    <h1>Ilex rugosa var. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Ilex rugosa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Ilex rugosa. The plant produces small white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded areas.</p>
