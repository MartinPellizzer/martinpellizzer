                    <h1>Isolepis disticha</h1>
<p>Isolepis disticha, commonly known as the two-branched spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, pond margins, and other moist habitats, forming dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish colonies in suitable wetland conditions.</p>
<p>Isolepis disticha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
