                    <h1>Indurgia razii</h1>
<p>Indurgia razii, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white waxy coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink and white, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a threatened species in the wild.</p>
