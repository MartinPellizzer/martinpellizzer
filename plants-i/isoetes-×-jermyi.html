                    <h1>Isoetes × jermyi</h1>
<p>Isoetes × jermyi, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a member of the genus Isoetes, which includes species of spikemosses.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial plant that typically grows in wet, boggy environments. The plant is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a spore cone at the tip of the stem. Isoetes × jermyi is a naturally occurring hybrid between Isoetes australis and Isoetes papuana, showcasing genetic diversity within the genus.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
