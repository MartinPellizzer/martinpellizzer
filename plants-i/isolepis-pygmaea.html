                    <h1>Isolepis pygmaea</h1>
<p>Isolepis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-parted flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland plants.</p>
<p>Isolepis pygmaea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
