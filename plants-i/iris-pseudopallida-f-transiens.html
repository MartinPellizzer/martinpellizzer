<p>Iris pseudopallida f. transiens, commonly known as the Transient White Iris, is a rare and elegant variant of the White Iris species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers, which bloom briefly during the spring season. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow environments. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces showy, upright flower stalks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fleeting blooming period, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical gardens.</p>
