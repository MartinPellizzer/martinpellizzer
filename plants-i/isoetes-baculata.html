                    <h1>Isoetes baculata</h1>
<p>Isoetes baculata, commonly known as the clubmoss spike fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiky morphology with a central axis covered in small, scale-like leaves. This plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds, often in shallow, muddy substrates. Isoetes baculata is a sporophyte that produces spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its structure and reproductive strategy reflect adaptations to its submerged or partially submerged habitat.</p>
