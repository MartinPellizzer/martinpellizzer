<p>Inga crista, commonly known as the "Crista Inga" or "Swordleaf Inga," is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with a distinctive sword-like shape, which gives it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds.</p>
<p>Inga crista is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
