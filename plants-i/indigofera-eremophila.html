                    <h1>Indigofera eremophila</h1>
<p>Indigofera eremophila, commonly known as the desert indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale blue or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Indigofera eremophila is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of dye.</p>
