                    <h1>Indigofera rupicola</h1>
<p>Indigofera rupicola, commonly known as the rock indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and for erosion control in degraded landscapes.</p>
