<p>Iva oraria, commonly known as the common ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early fall. Iva oraria is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
