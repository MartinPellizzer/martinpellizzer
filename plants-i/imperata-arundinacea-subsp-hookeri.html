<p>Imperata arundinacea subsp.</p>
<p>hookeri, commonly known as hooker's cogon grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that produce a large number of small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, including disturbed soils and coastal areas. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hooker's cogon grass is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
