                    <h1>Isnardia natans</h1>
<p>Isnardia natans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to freshwater habitats in Europe, Asia, and North America, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. The plant is characterized by its floating, leafless stems that bear small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. These bladders are a key adaptation for its carnivorous lifestyle, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
<p>Isnardia natans plays a minor but ecologically significant role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water oxygenation and serving as a food source for small aquatic animals.</p>
