                    <h1>Iteroloba bipinnatisecta</h1>
<p>Iteroloba bipinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a distinctive shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and its bark is typically rugged and fissured. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
