<p>Ilex theezans f. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent ilex, is a variant of the evergreen holly species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy, or pubescent, foliage, which distinguishes it from other forms of Ilex. The leaves are typically elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a characteristic feature of the genus.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
