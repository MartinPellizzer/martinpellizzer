                    <h1>Iris × citriviola</h1>
<p>Iris × citriviola, commonly known as the lemon iris, is a hybrid perennial plant that combines traits from the bearded iris and the iris citriodora.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which resemble those of the lemon-scented iris, and its upright, sword-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is well-suited for gardens and landscapes due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Iris × citriviola is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
