                    <h1>Ipomoea parasitica</h1>
<p>Ipomoea parasitica, commonly known as the dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow or orange flowers and has a unique, thread-like structure that allows it to attach to and extract nutrients from its host. The plant is often found on members of the legume family, such as beans and peas, and can cause significant damage to crops. Its life cycle involves a seed stage, germination, and then the development of haustoria to penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Ipomoea parasitica is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
