                    <h1>Ischaemum lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum lanceolatum, commonly known as slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Ischaemum lanceolatum is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it a common indicator of ecological succession.</p>
