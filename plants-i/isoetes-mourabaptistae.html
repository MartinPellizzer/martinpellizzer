                    <h1>Isoetes mourabaptistae</h1>
<p>Isoetes mourabaptistae, commonly known as the Mourabaptist spike-moss, is a rare and ancient species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, spirally arranged spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically submerged in water. The plant is adapted to freshwater environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary history as a primitive vascular plant, with a simple structure and limited growth habits.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
