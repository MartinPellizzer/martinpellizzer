                    <h1>Iodes yatesii var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Iodes yatesii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf iodine plant, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, glabrous (hairless) leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. This variant is typically found in specific habitats, such as rocky soils or open woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade. The plant is known for its aromatic compounds, which may contribute to its ecological interactions with pollinators and herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in certain regions.</p>
