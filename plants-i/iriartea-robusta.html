                    <h1>Iriartea robusta</h1>
<p>Iriartea robusta, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, which are essential for its reproduction. Iriartea robusta is a slow-growing species that can live for centuries, making it a significant component of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
