                    <h1>Iocenes</h1>
<p>Iocenes, commonly known as the "Iocene" period, is a geological time interval that spans from approximately 56 to 33.9 million years ago.</p>
<p>While not a plant, the term "Iocenes" is often associated with the botanical changes that occurred during this era. This period was marked by a warm climate that supported diverse flora, including early flowering plants. The vegetation was dominated by angiosperms, which thrived in the tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The Iocene saw the continued diversification of plant life, setting the stage for the modern flora we see today.</p>
