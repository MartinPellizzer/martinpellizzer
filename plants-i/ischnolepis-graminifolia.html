<p>Ischnolepis graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, grass-like appearance, with small, closely arranged leaves that form a dense mat. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure includes a thallus that is differentiated into stem-like and leaf-like parts, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Ischnolepis graminifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
