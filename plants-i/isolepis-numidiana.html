                    <h1>Isolepis numidiana</h1>
<p>Isolepis numidiana, commonly known as the African bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has tall, slender stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Isolepis numidiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
