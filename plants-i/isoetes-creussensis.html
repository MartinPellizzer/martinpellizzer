<p>Isoetes creussensis, commonly known as the Creussens' watermoss, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically arranged in a ring around the stem. The plant is adapted to freshwater environments and thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. Its morphology includes a central axis with leaf-like structures called strobila, which house the reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Isoetes creussensis is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland habitats.</p>
