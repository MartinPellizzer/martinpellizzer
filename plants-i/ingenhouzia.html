<p>Ingenhouzia, commonly known as the "blue-eyed grass," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their grass-like appearance and showy, blue or violet flowers. Ingenhouzia species typically grow in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. They produce small, three-lobed leaves and have a unique flowering structure with a central spike surrounded by bracts.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are not widely known outside of their native range.</p>
