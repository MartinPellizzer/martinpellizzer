                    <h1>Isoetes hallasanensis</h1>
<p>Isoetes hallasanensis, commonly known as the Hallasan watermoss, is a rare species of aquatic fern found primarily in the volcanic regions of Jeju Island, South Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Isoetes, which includes over 300 species of spore-bearing plants known as quillworts. This plant is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that resemble quills, and it thrives in freshwater environments with low nutrient levels. Isoetes hallasanensis is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its habitat, including the mineral-rich waters of the island's volcanic springs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity.</p>
