<p>Ichthyomethia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in salty, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it withstand harsh maritime conditions. Ichthyomethia species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal ecosystems.</p>
