                    <h1>Ischaemum striatum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum striatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a slender, upright growth habit. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a distinct midrib and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Ischaemum striatum is often found in grasslands and is considered an important component of native plant communities.</p>
