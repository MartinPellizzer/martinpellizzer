<p>Isoetes echinospora var. braunii, commonly known as the Braun's spiky watermace, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiky, and often branched sporophylls that bear the spores. This plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. Its morphology includes a fleshy, root-like structure called a rhizome, which helps anchor it in the substrate.</p>
