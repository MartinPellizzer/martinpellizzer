                    <h1>Iberis intermedia var. dunalii</h1>
<p>Iberis intermedia var. dunalii, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, rounded, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in coastal areas.</p>
