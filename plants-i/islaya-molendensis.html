<p>Islaya molendensis, commonly known as the Molendens Island lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Molendens in the southern Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or marshy habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and typically have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Islaya molendensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
