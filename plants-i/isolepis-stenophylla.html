<p>Isolepis stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features grass-like foliage with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Isolepis stenophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
