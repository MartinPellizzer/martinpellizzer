                <h1>Impatiens capensis</h1>
<p>Impatiens capensis, commonly known as jewelweed, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing or upright growth habit and is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of orange, yellow, and red, which bloom from midsummer to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, sticky hairs.</p>
<p>Impatiens capensis is also known for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, as the pods explode when mature, launching seeds several feet away.</p>
