<p>Isoetes virginica var. piedmontana, commonly known as the Piedmont watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing, spike-like structures called strobils, which are typically found at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds with muddy substrates. Its leaves are long, ribbon-like, and often have a distinct midrib, which helps in identifying the species.</p>
