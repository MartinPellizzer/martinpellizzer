                <h1>Isoglossa dichotoma</h1>
<p>Isoglossa dichotoma, commonly known as the forked isoglossa, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine and arctic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts, creating a distinctive, symmetrical appearance. The plant typically grows in low nutrient soils and is adapted to extreme cold and high altitude conditions. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Isoglossa dichotoma is considered a valuable indicator species for studying ecological changes in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
