                    <h1>Ichnanthus planotis var. pilosus</h1>
<p>Ichnanthus planotis var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy-leafed marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
