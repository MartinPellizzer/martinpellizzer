<p>Isolepis holoschoenus, commonly known as the marsh arrowgrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Isolepis holoschoenus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
