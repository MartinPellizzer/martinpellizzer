<p>Inga biglobosa, commonly known as the "bottle tree" or "biglobosa," is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and its distinctive, bottle-shaped trunk that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing two large, bean-like seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Inga biglobosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in ecological systems.</p>
