                    <h1>Ischnanthus</h1>
<p>Ischnanthus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The leaves are typically fleshy and adapted to store water, reflecting their ability to thrive in arid environments. Ischnanthus species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or trees, and they often have a short flowering period.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
