<p>Isoetes triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed water starwort, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, triquetrous (three-lobed) spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a rosette-like formation. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it thrives in shallow, still waters. Its leaves are long and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface or submerged depending on the species variant.</p>
<p>Isoetes triquetra plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
