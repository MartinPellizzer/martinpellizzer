<p>Isoetes longissima subsp.</p>
<p>perralderiana, commonly known as the long-stemmed watermace, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes, where it anchors itself to the substrate with its rhizomes. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, spike-like formations along the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in low-nutrient conditions, making it a common indicator of clean, oligotrophic water bodies.</p>
