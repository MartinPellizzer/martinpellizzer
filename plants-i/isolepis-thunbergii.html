<p>Isolepis thunbergii, commonly known as the tufted flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>Isolepis thunbergii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
