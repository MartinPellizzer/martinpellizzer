<p>Isoetes longissima subsp.</p>
<p>adspersa, commonly known as the scattered water parsley, is a rare aquatic fern-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that form dense underwater mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on specialized structures called sporangium-bearing branches. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in marshes or along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
