<p>Isolepis lereschii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Isolepis lereschii thrives in water-saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
