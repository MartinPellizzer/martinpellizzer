<p>Isoetes sinensis var. coreana, commonly known as the Korean water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that exhibits unique morphological features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are borne on specialized stalks called sporophylls.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological importance in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
