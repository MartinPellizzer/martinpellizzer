<p>Isoetes triangula, commonly known as the triangular water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, triangular spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a rosette-like formation. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands, where it thrives in shallow, still water. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Isoetes triangula is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds that contribute to the aesthetic and ecological value of its habitat.</p>
