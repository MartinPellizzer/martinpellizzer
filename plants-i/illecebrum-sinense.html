                    <h1>Illecebrum sinense</h1>
<p>Illecebrum sinense, commonly known as Chinese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex system of slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found parasitizing species within the legume family. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
