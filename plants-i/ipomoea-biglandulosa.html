<p>Ipomoea biglandulosa, commonly known as the large-fruited morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces large, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
