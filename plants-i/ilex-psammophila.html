<p>Ilex psammophila, commonly known as the sand dune holly, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid and sandy environments, with small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.
