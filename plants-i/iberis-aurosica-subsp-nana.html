<p>Iberis aurosica subsp.</p>
<p>nana, commonly known as the dwarf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of glossy, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
