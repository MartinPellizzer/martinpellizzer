                <h1>Isotrema nakaoi</h1>
<p>Isotrema nakaoi, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include a slender, wiry stem and small, delicate leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Isotrema nakaoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
