                    <h1>Imbricaria media</h1>
<p>Imbricaria media, commonly known as the common lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of environments, including bark, soil, and rocks, and is often found in temperate regions. The thallus, or body, of Imbricaria media is crust-like, with a dense, compact structure that allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces. It plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil formation and serving as an indicator of air quality.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a resilient and widespread species in many ecosystems.</p>
