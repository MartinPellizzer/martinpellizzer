                    <h1>Iseilema actinostachys</h1>
<p>Iseilema actinostachys, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, red-orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Iseilema actinostachys is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
