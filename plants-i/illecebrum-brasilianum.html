                    <h1>Illecebrum brasilianum</h1>
<p>Illecebrum brasilianum, commonly known as Brazilian dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to South America and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
