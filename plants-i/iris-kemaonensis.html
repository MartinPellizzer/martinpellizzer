<p>Iris kemaonensis, commonly known as the Kemaon iris, is a species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iris kemaonensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
