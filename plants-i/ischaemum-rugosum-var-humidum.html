                    <h1>Ischaemum rugosum var. humidum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum rugosum var. humidum, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
