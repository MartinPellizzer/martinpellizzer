<p>Ischaemum segetum, commonly known as field barnyard grass, is an annual grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a weed in many cultivated environments.</p>
