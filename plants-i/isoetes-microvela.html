                    <h1>Isoetes microvela</h1>
<p>Isoetes microvela, commonly known as the small-velvet watermace, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and its ability to thrive in shallow, still freshwater environments. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on specialized leaves called sporophylls. Isoetes microvela is notable for its morphological adaptations that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates a healthy, stable aquatic ecosystem.</p>
