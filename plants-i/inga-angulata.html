<p>Inga angulata, commonly known as the angular inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in humid lowland forests.</p>
<p>Inga angulata is also valued for its timber and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its ecological benefits.</p>
