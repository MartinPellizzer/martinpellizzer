                    <h1>Idiothamnus lilloi</h1>
<p>Idiothamnus lilloi, commonly known as the Lilloi wattle, is a shrub native to Australia, particularly found in the southern regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the genus Idiothamnus. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The Lilloi wattle is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
