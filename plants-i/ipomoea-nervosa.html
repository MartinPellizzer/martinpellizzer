                    <h1>Ipomoea nervosa</h1>
<p>Ipomoea nervosa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy blue or violet flowers that open in the morning. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or spread along the ground make it both ornamental and invasive in some areas.</p>
<p>Ipomoea nervosa is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization.</p>
