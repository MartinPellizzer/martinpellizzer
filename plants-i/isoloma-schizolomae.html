                    <h1>Isoloma schizolomae</h1>
<p>Isoloma schizolomae, commonly known as the Schizoloma lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a distinct botanical structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which is essential for its survival and growth. Isoloma schizolomae is often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject for ecological and pharmacological research.</p>
