<p>Isolepis decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other similar plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often dominating wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Isolepis decipiens is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
