<p>Iris pseudopumila subsp.</p>
<p>gozoensis, commonly known as Gozo iris, is a rare and endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Gozo in Malta. It is a small herbaceous perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, limestone soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. Its limited distribution and unique ecological niche make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat degradation, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
