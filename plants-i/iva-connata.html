<p>Iva connata, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture with prominent veins.</p>
<p>Iva connata plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and habitat.</p>
