<p>Isatis tinctoria subsp.</p>
<p>tomentella, commonly known as the woolly woad, is a variant of the woad plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces blue flowers, similar to its parent species, and is typically found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial, often growing to a height of 1 to 2 meters.</p>
<p>While less commonly cultivated for dye production than the standard woad, it is still valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance.</p>
