                    <h1>Isoetes × fairbrothersii</h1>
<p>Isoetes × fairbrothersii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a member of the genus Isoetes, which includes species of spore-bearing plants known as quillworts.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid resulting from the cross between Isoetes australis and Isoetes muricata, two species native to southern regions of Australia. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporocarps, which are often found at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptability.</p>
