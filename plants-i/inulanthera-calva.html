                    <h1>Inulanthera calva</h1>
<p>Inulanthera calva, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning, often in shades of purple or pink. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with slender stems that can spread over several meters. Its leaves are small, opposite, and covered in a fine, white pubescence that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in harsh desert environments.</p>
