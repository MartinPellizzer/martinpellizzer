<p>Isolepis paraensis, commonly known as the Paraensis荸荠, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Isolepis paraensis is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat.</p>
