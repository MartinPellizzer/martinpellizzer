<p>Isotrema manshuriensis, commonly known as the Manshurian isotrema, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China, where it thrives in temperate forest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, dark berries that are often consumed by local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isotrema manshuriensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
