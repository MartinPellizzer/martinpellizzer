                    <h1>Ixia nervosa</h1>
<p>Ixia nervosa, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Western Cape region of South Africa, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to lilac-colored flowers, which bloom in late summer. Ixia nervosa is a perennial herb with a short, fibrous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
