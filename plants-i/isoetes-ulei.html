<p>Isoetes ulei, commonly known as the water starwort, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a rosette-like formation on the plant's stalk. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface or submerged beneath it.</p>
<p>Isoetes ulei plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
