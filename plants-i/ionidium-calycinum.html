                    <h1>Ionidium calycinum</h1>
<p>Ionidium calycinum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem that branches into multiple fleshy, cylindrical segments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and aiding in survival in dry environments.</p>
<p>Ionidium calycinum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
