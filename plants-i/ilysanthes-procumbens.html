<p>Ilysanthes procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate ilysanthes, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Ilysanthes procumbens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and aesthetic value.</p>
