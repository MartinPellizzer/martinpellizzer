                    <h1>Isochilus pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Isochilus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered isochilus, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, erect growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
