                    <h1>Isotrema kechangense</h1>
<p>Isotrema kechangense, commonly known as the Kechang mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous, sticky berries. The plant attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria, while performing photosynthesis independently. It is often found in humid, shaded forest environments, contributing to the ecological complexity of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
