<p>Iberis grosmiquelii subsp.</p>
<p>senneniana, commonly known as the Sennenian Iberis, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has hirsute (hairy) leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
