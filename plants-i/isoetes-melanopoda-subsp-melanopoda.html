<p>Isoetes melanopoda subsp.</p>
<p>melanopoda, commonly known as the black-stem watermace, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that grow in dense clusters, often forming a compact rosette.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in still or slow-moving waters with muddy or silty substrates. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and supporting diverse invertebrate life.</p>
