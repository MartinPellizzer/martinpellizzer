<p>Intsia rhombodea, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
