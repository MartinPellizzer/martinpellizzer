                    <h1>Ilex glabra f. leucocarpa</h1>
<p>Ilex glabra f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited holly, is a variant of the common holly species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that remain throughout the winter. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow berries that are distinct from the typical red berries of the standard Ilex glabra. These berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for various bird species.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and hardy nature in shaded to partially sunny environments.</p>
