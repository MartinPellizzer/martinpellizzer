                    <h1>Inga cayennensis</h1>
<p>Inga cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne inga, is a species of leguminous tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Inga, which includes numerous species commonly referred to as "ice cream beans" due to their pod-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate, and its rapid growth habit, making it a valuable species for agroforestry. It produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to fix nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia makes it an important component in soil enrichment and sustainable land use.</p>
