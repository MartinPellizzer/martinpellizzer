<p>Ischaemum longipilum, commonly known as long-haired barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
