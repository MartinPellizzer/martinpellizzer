                    <h1>Iris flava</h1>
<p>Iris flava, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing showy, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize wetland habitats effectively.</p>
<p>Iris flava is often used in ornamental gardening but can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
