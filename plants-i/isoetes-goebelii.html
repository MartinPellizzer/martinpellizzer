<p>Isoetes goebelii, commonly known as the Goebel's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing, spike-like structure called a strobilus, which is a distinctive feature of the watermilfoil family. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it anchors itself to the substrate with its rhizomes. Its leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Isoetes goebelii is often found in nutrient-poor waters and is considered an indicator species for certain environmental conditions.</p>
