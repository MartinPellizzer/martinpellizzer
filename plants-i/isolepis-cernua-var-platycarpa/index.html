<p>Isolepis cernua var. platycarpa is a lesser-known but ecologically significant plant species found in wetland environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves and more compact growth habit compared to its standard form. It thrives in shallow, waterlogged soils and plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to its unique characteristics, it is often overlooked despite its importance in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
