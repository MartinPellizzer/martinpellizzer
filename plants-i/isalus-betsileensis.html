<p>Isalus betsileensis, commonly known as the Betsile Forest Fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Isalus betsileensis is considered critically endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Madagascar.</p>
