                    <h1>Illecebrum argenteum</h1>
<p>Illecebrum argenteum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
<p>Illecebrum argenteum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows.</p>
