                    <h1>Inga pluricarpellata</h1>
<p>Inga pluricarpellata, commonly known as the many-celled inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain multiple seeds, which is reflected in its scientific name. It has a shallow root system and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Inga pluricarpellata plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria.</p>
