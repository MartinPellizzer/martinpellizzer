<p>Iriartea exorrhiza, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces a massive, spiny cone that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Iriartea exorrhiza is a slow-growing species with a long lifespan, often living for over a century.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
