<p>Isolepis roylei, commonly known as the tufted flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like stems are often tufted at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-nerved, triangular capsules.</p>
<p>Isolepis roylei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
