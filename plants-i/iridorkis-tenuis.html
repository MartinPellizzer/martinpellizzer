<p>Iridorkis tenuis, commonly known as the slender iridorkis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes irises and related species, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-lobed structure, typically blooming in late spring. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments, and it is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iridorkis tenuis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
