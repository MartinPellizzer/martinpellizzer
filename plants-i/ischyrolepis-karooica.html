<p>Ischyrolepis karooica, commonly known as the Karoo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of various host trees, such as acacia and eucalyptus, and derives some of its nutrients from these hosts. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Ischyrolepis karooica plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to biodiversity through its parasitic and mutualistic relationships.</p>
