<p>Ixocactus, commonly known as the "Mexican star cactus," is a genus of cacti native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often branch out into a star-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically features small, sharp spines and produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Ixocactus species are succulents, meaning they store water in their thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>They thrive in well-draining soil and require minimal water, making them popular among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
