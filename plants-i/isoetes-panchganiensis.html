<p>Isoetes panchganiensis, commonly known as the Panchgani watermace, is a rare species of water fern belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a stalked, spore-bearing structure called a sorus. This plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. Its leaves are usually spirally arranged and exhibit a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isoetes panchganiensis is considered an important indicator species for aquatic ecosystems.</p>
