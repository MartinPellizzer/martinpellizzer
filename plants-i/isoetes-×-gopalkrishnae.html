<p>Isoetes × gopalkrishnae, commonly known as the hybrid water moss, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes, which consists of species known as quillworts.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, root-like structures called rhizoids and its ability to thrive in freshwater environments. This hybrid plant is typically found in wetlands, lakes, and slow-moving streams where it can anchor itself in muddy substrates. Its reproductive system involves the production of spores, a feature common to many members of the Isoetes genus.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Isoetes × gopalkrishnae is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
