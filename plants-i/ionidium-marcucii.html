                    <h1>Ionidium marcucii</h1>
<p>Ionidium marcucii, commonly known as the Sicilian rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the limestone-rich regions of Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a small herbaceous plant with slender, upright stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the alkaline soils of its rocky habitat. Its flowers have a unique structure with a spurred lip, typical of many orchid species, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ionidium marcucii is considered critically endangered.</p>
