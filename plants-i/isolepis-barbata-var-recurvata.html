                    <h1>Isolepis barbata var. recurvata</h1>
<p>Isolepis barbata var. recurvata, commonly known as the recurved tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often form dense tussocks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its recurved leaf tips, giving it a unique appearance compared to other sedge species.</p>
