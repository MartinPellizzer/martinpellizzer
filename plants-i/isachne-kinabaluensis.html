                    <h1>Isachne kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Isachne kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu isachne, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo, specifically Mount Kinabalu.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of the mountain's cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
