<p>Ischyrolepis nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Ischyrolepis nubigena plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small animals.</p>
