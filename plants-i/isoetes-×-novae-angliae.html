<p>Isoetes × novae-angliae, commonly known as the New England water starwort, is a hybrid species of the genus Isoetes, characterized by its spore-bearing spirogyra-like structures.</p>
<p>It is a submerged aquatic plant with a complex morphology, featuring a central axis surrounded by a rosette of leaf-like structures called stigmaria. The plant is native to North America and thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered along the stigmaria and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Isoetes × novae-angliae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
