                    <h1>Isoetes lacustris var. stricta</h1>
<p>Isoetes lacustris var. stricta, commonly known as the rigid water horsetail, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically submerged in water. This plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it often forms dense, ribbon-like mats. Its spore-producing structures, called strobili, are positioned at the apex of the plant, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important indicator species for water quality and wetland ecosystems.</p>
