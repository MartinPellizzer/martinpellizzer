<p>Iberis ciliata var. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae candytuft, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate, often with ciliate margins, and stems that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
