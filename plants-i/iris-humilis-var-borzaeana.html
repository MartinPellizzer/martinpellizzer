                    <h1>Iris humilis var. borzaeana</h1>
<p>Iris humilis var. borzaeana, commonly known as the Borzaean marsh iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue to violet-colored flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
