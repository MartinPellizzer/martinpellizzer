                    <h1>Illipe butyracea</h1>
<p>Illipe butyracea, commonly known as African shea tree, is a tropical tree native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces a fruit with a hard, woody shell enclosing a creamy, oily kernel. This kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and food products.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its economic contributions.</p>
