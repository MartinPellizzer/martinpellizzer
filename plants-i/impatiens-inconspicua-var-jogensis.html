<p>Impatiens inconspicua var. jogensis, commonly known as the Jog's Impatiens, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically during the wet season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is often found in forest understories, where it benefits from the dappled light and moist soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
