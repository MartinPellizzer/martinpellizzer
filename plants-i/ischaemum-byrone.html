                    <h1>Ischaemum byrone</h1>
<p>Ischaemum byrone, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Ischaemum byrone is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in moist areas.</p>
