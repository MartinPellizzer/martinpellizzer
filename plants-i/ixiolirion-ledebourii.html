<p>Ixiolirion ledebourii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically in late spring or early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>
<p>Ixiolirion ledebourii is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
