<p>Ipomoea newmannii, commonly known as the Newmann's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. Its rapid growth habit and climbing nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its spread.</p>
