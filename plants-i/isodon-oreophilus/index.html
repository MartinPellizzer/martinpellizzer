                            <h1>Isodon Oreophilus</h1>
<p>Isodon oreophilus is a rare and intriguing plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. Known for its unique medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. This perennial herb features slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that thrive in cool, humid environments. Its flowering period brings forth delicate blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Isodon oreophilus is now considered endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
