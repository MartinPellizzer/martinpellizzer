                    <h1>Iris pseudacorus f. longiacuminata</h1>
<p>Iris pseudacorus f. longiacuminata, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a striking wetland plant characterized by its bright yellow flowers and sword-like leaves.</p>
<p>This cultivar is a variation of the common yellow flag iris, known for its elongated, acuminate (tapering to a point) leaves that give it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in pond margins. The plant produces showy, upright flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens, though it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
