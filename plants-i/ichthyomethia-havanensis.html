                    <h1>Ichthyomethia havanensis</h1>
<p>Ichthyomethia havanensis, commonly known as the Cuban water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the freshwater habitats of Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are divided into small, serrated segments, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
