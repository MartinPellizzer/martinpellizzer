<p>Isolepis lineata, commonly known as the narrow flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystems by filtering water and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Isolepis lineata is an important indicator species for wetland health and biodiversity.</p>
