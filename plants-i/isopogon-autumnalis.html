<p>Isopogon autumnalis, commonly known as the yellow honey bush, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are rich in nectar and attract a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Isopogon autumnalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
