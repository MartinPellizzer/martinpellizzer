<p>Ischnosiphon puberulus var. verruculosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and slender, twining stems. The plant's surface is covered with small, rough bumps, giving it a textured appearance. It typically attaches to the stems of other plants using specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
