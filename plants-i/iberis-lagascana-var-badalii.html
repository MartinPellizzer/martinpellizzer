                    <h1>Iberis lagascana var. badalii</h1>
<p>Iberis lagascana var. badalii, commonly known as the Badal√≠ Iberis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant features pinnately divided leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and Mediterranean climates, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is due to its compact form and long-lasting blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
