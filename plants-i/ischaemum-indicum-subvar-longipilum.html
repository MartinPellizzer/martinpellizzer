<p>Ischaemum indicum subvar. longipilum, commonly known as the hairy barnyard grass, is a grass species native to Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in cultivated areas and along roadsides.</p>
