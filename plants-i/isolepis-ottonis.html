<p>Isolepis ottonis, commonly known as the marsh arrowgrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Isolepis ottonis is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
