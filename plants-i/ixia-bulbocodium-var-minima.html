<p>Ixia bulbocodium var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf yellow bulbous orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous structure that stores nutrients for growth. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal that resembles a small horn. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively small size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
