                    <h1>Ichnanthus angustifolius</h1>
<p>Ichnanthus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has a distinct arrowhead-shaped leaf, which is usually narrow and pointed, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Ichnanthus angustifolius is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
