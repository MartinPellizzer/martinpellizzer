<p>Icicariba simaruba, commonly known as the West Indian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in furniture and cabinetry.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
