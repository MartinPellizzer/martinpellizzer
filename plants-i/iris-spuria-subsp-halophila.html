<p>Iris spuria subsp.</p>
<p>halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking blue to purple flowers. It thrives in saline environments, such as coastal marshes and tidal flats, demonstrating its halophytic nature.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are arranged in dense spikes and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to high-salinity soils and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
