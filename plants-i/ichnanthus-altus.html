<p>Ichnanthus altus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red at the base.

It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and its unique floral structure that resembles that of the true lily of the valley.</p>
