                    <h1>Iocaste acicularis</h1>
<p>Iocaste acicularis, commonly known as the needleleaf yew, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme cold and low sunlight conditions. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its roots are highly resilient, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, Iocaste acicularis is of particular interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
