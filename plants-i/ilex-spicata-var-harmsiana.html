<p>Ilex spicata var. harmsiana, commonly known as Harms' holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which is typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to urban environments make it a popular landscaping choice.</p>
<p>The varietal form, harmsiana, is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical Ilex spicata.</p>
