                    <h1>Isocoma fruticosa</h1>
<p>Isocoma fruticosa, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or subshrub with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Isocoma fruticosa is adapted to full sun and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
