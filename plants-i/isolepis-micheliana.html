<p>Isolepis micheliana, commonly known as Michel's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Isolepis micheliana is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, playing a role in maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
