                    <h1>Iberodes littoralis</h1>
<p>Iberodes littoralis, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Iberodes littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
