                    <h1>Islaya islayensis var. minor</h1>
<p>Islaya islayensis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser islaya, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth form and dense, hairy foliage that helps it survive in cold, arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapted for pollination by wind or specialized insects. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
