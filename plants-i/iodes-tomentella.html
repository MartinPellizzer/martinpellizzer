<p>Iodes tomentella, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its hairy, woolly appearance helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
