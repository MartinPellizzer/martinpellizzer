                    <h1>Ichthyothere suffruticosa var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Ichthyothere suffruticosa var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy ichthyothere, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, woody stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, further enhancing its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to other varieties of ichthyothere.</p>
