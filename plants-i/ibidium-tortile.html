                    <h1>Ibidium tortile</h1>
<p>Ibidium tortile, commonly known as the spiral lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is known for its intricate, spiral-like growth pattern on its thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Its thallus is typically crustose, forming a thin, flat layer on rocks or bark.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in moist, shaded environments and is used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
