                    <h1>Ichnanthus fastigiatus</h1>
<p>Ichnanthus fastigiatus, commonly known as the upright broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats where it can attach to host plants such as grasses or shrubs. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a distinctive, often fragrant odor to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, influencing both host plant health and pollinator behavior.</p>
