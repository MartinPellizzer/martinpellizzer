                    <h1>Isolepis oligantha</h1>
<p>Isolepis oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense, compact tufts, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Isolepis oligantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
