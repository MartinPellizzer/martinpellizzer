<p>Ischaemum dioecum, commonly known as the male and female grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dioecious nature, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually green and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>Ischaemum dioecum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations.</p>
