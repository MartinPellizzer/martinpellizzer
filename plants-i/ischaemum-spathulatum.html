                    <h1>Ischaemum spathulatum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum spathulatum, commonly known as the broadleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster that produces small, two-lobed bracts. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland or riparian environments.</p>
