<p>Iris floridana, commonly known as the Florida iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to swampy conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Iris floridana plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
