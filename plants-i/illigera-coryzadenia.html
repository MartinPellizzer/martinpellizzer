<p>Illigera coryzadenia, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are often covered in a dense network of fine, white roots, which help it absorb nutrients from the poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
