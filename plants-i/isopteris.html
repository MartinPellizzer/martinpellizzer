                    <h1>Isopteris</h1>
<p>Isopteris, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that often resemble the pattern of a clover leaf. Isopteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. They have rhizomatous growth habits, allowing them to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy.</p>
