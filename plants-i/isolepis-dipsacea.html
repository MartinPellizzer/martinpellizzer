<p>Isolepis dipsacea, commonly known as the water clubmoss, is a species of flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and small, scale-like leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spiky inflorescences. It thrives in marshy environments, often forming part of the vegetation in shallow water or saturated soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils, it is an important component of these ecosystems.</p>
