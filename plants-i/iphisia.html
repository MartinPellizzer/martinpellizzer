                    <h1>Iphisia</h1>
<p>Iphisia, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble delicate parchment, and its flowers, which bloom in shades of pale blue and white, emit a faint, almost imperceptible fragrance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often near water sources, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Iphisia is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
