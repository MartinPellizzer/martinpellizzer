                    <h1>Isoloma vulcanicola</h1>
<p>Isoloma vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, volcanic soil and is adapted to high-altitude environments with extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are broad and succulent, allowing it to store water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isoloma vulcanicola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
