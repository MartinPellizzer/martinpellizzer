                    <h1>Imperata cylindrica var. major</h1>
<p>Imperata cylindrica var. major, commonly known as purple mat grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features stiff, cylindrical leaves that are typically purple or pink in color, which distinguish it from other varieties of Imperata. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like structure that produces small, spiky flowers, contributing to its ornamental value in some landscapes.</p>
