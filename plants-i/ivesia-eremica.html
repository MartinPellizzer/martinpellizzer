                    <h1>Ivesia eremica</h1>
<p>Ivesia eremica, commonly known as the desert ivy, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Ivesia eremica is well adapted to drought and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
