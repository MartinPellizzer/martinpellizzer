<p>Inga tergemina, commonly known as the "white inga," is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, elliptical leaflets and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the forest understory.</p>
<p>Inga tergemina is often found in moist, shaded environments and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
