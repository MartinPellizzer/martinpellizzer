                    <h1>Isolepis romana</h1>
<p>Isolepis romana, commonly known as the narrowleaf spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils such as wet meadows and marshes.</p>
<p>Isolepis romana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
