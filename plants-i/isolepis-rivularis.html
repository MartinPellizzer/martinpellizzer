<p>Isolepis rivularis, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found along riverbanks and in swampy regions.</p>
<p>Isolepis rivularis plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
