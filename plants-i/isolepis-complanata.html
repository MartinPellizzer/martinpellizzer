                    <h1>Isolepis complanata</h1>
<p>Isolepis complanata, commonly known as flatleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Isolepis complanata is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
