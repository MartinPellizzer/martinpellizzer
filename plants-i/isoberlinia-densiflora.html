                    <h1>Isoberlinia densiflora</h1>
<p>Isoberlinia densiflora, commonly known as the African ebony tree, is a leguminous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark wood and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, heavy wood, it is valued for furniture and musical instruments, though its conservation status is of concern due to overharvesting.</p>
