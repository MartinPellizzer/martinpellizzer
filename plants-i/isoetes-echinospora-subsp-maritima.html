<p>Isoetes echinospora subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as the sea spike moss, is a specialized aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spiky, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are arranged along the leaf-like structures known as strobila.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in brackish or marine environments, such as estuaries and coastal wetlands. Its morphology is adapted to withstand saline conditions, with a reduced root system and a robust, floating stem.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
