                    <h1>Ilex fargesii var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Ilex fargesii var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved Chinese holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical Ilex fargesii. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
