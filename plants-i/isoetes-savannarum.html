<p>Isoetes savannarum, commonly known as the savanna watermilfoil, is a member of the genus Isoetes, which includes species of spore-bearing plants known as quillworts.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, floating mat. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are located on the upper surface of the leaves.</p>
<p>Isoetes savannarum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
