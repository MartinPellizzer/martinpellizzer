                            <h1>Indigofera Colutea</h1>
<p>Indigofera colutea is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family and is known for its striking blue to purple flowers. This plant has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it valuable in agricultural settings. Despite its beauty and utility, it remains relatively underappreciated in modern botany.</p>
