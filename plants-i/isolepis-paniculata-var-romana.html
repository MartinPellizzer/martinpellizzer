<p>Isolepis paniculata var. romana, commonly known as the Roman flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botanical taxonomy.</p>
