The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane grasslands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
