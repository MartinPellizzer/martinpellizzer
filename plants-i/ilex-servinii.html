                    <h1>Ilex servinii</h1>
<p>Ilex servinii, commonly known as the Servinâ€™s holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex servinii thrives in coastal and limestone soils, often growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a notable example of endemic plant life in the Canary Islands.</p>
