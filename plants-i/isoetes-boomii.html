<p>Isoetes boomii, commonly known as the Boome's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are typically arranged in a rosette-like pattern. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow, still waters with soft, muddy substrates. Its morphology includes a central stem with leaf-like structures called stigmaria, which help in anchoring the plant.</p>
<p>Isoetes boomii plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
