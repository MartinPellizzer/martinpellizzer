<p>Isoetes velata var. asturicensis, commonly known as the Asturian water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Isoetales and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its sporangia are borne on specialized stems called sporophylls, which are typically submerged.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences, making it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>
