                    <h1>Indigofera pendula f. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Indigofera pendula f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving indigo plant, is a unique variant of the Indigofera pendula species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and delicate, fern-like leaves that thrive in low-light conditions. This form exhibits a more compact and bushy structure compared to the typical Indigofera pendula. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple and white, adding ornamental value to shaded gardens.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in less-than-ideal light environments.</p>
