                    <h1>Indigofera serpentinicola</h1>
<p>Indigofera serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine indigo, is a flowering plant native to rocky, nutrient-poor soils in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in serpentine soils, which are rich in heavy metals and low in essential nutrients. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to thrive in such harsh environments makes it an interesting subject for botanical research.</p>
