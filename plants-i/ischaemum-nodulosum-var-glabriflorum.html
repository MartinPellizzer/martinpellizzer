                    <h1>Ischaemum nodulosum var. glabriflorum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum nodulosum var. glabriflorum, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, tufted stems that grow from a rhizomatous base, and its leaves are typically narrow and hairy. The inflorescence consists of loose, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
