                    <h1>Isoetes fuliginosa</h1>
<p>Isoetes fuliginosa, commonly known as the black rush, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the bottom of shallow water bodies. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on specialized leaves called sporophylls. Isoetes fuliginosa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species for certain aquatic habitats.</p>
