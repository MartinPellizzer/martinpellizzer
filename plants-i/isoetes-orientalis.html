<p>Isoetes orientalis, commonly known as the oriental watermoss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes in the family Isoetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged spore-bearing leaves that are often submerged in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobils, which contain the spores for reproduction. Isoetes orientalis is typically found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and ecological stability in its habitat.</p>
