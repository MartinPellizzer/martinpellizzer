                    <h1>Ipomoea obscura var. fragilis</h1>
<p>Ipomoea obscura var. fragilis, commonly known as the fragile morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in gardens.</p>
<p>However, due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain areas.</p>
