                    <h1>Ionidium parietariifolium var. berteroi</h1>
<p>Ionidium parietariifolium var. berteroi, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which aids in water collection and protection from strong winds.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to xeric conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
