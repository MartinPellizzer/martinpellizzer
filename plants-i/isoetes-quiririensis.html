<p>Isoetes quiririensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water clubmoss, is a rare aquatic plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Isoetes, which is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes and streams, where it forms dense underwater colonies. Its leaves are long and ribbon-like, often forming a rosette structure that helps it anchor in soft substrates.</p>
