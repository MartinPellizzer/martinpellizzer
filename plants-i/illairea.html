                    <h1>Illairea</h1>
<p>Illairea, commonly known as the silver bush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Illairea species typically have small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. They are shrubs or small trees that thrive in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value and drought tolerance, Illairea species are popular in xeriscaping and native gardens.</p>
