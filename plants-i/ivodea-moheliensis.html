<p>Ivodea moheliensis, commonly known as the Moheli ivy, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Moheli in the Comoros archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. Ivodea moheliensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in coastal forests or along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
