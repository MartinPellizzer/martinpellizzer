<p>Iris tenax subsp.</p>
<p>innominata, commonly known as the slender iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of *I. tenax*.</p>
