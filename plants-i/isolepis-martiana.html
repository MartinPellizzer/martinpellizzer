<p>Isolepis martiana, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Isolepis martiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
