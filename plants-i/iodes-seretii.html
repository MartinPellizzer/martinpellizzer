<p>Iodes seretii, commonly known as the seretii orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pale green or white with a subtle, sweet scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Iodes seretii is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
