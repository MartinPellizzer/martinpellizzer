                    <h1>Illicium difengpi</h1>
<p>Illicium difengpi, commonly known as Chinese star anise, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Schisandraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruits that resemble anise. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark brown, spiny pods containing aromatic seeds. Illicium difengpi is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from the more widely known star anise, Illicium verum.</p>
