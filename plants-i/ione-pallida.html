<p>Ione pallida, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ione pallida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
