                    <h1>Isonandra lanceolata var. anfractuosa</h1>
<p>Isonandra lanceolata var. anfractuosa, commonly known as the zigzag sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that often curl and twist, forming a distinctive zigzag pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and wash environments.</p>
