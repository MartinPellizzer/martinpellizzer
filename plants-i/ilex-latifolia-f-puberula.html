<p>Ilex latifolia f. puberula, commonly known as the Southern holly, is a variant of the broadleaf holly native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>The pubescent (hairy) texture of its leaves distinguishes this form from the typical variety.</p>
