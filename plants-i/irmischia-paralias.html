<p>Irmischia paralias, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Irmischia paralias plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
