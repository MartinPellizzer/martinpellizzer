<p>Isoetes erongensis, commonly known as the Elongated water clover, is a rare aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant is native to parts of East Asia, particularly China, and is often found in marshy or pond habitats. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, releasing spores into the water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
