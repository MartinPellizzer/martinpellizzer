                    <h1>Isoetes echinospora var. maritima</h1>
<p>Isoetes echinospora var. maritima, commonly known as the sea spike moss, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spore-bearing spikes that protrude from the water's surface. The plant has specialized leaves that aid in gas exchange and photosynthesis in its submerged habitat. It is typically found in brackish or saltwater environments, such as estuaries and tidal marshes.</p>
<p>This variety exhibits adaptations to withstand fluctuating salinity and water levels, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
