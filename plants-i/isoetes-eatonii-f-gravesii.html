<p>Isoetes eatonii f. gravesii, commonly known as the Graves' water starwort, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Isoetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged leaves that are typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered at the tips of the leaf-like stems, producing spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
