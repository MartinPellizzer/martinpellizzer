<p>Iteiluma rheophytopsis, commonly known as the stream fern, is a rare aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers.</p>
<p>It has delicate, feather-like fronds that are adapted to withstand strong water currents. The plant typically grows in shaded, rocky environments where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on water for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited geographic distribution.</p>
