                    <h1>Ischaemum ciliare var. villosum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum ciliare var. villosum, commonly known as hairy cutgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, slightly hairy blades that often curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
