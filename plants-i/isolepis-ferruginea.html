<p>Isolepis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>Isolepis ferruginea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms.</p>
