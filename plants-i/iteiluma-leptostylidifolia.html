<p>Iteiluma leptostylidifolia, commonly known as the slender-styled fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including small sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
