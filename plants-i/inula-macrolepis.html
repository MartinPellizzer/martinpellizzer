                    <h1>Inula macrolepis</h1>
<p>Inula macrolepis, commonly known as the woolly elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green stems and large, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic, and often bitter tasting milky sap, which is a feature of the genus Inula. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its woolly appearance.</p>
<p>Inula macrolepis is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
