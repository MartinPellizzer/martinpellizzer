<p>Isolepis distigmatosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland or marshy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is often found in conservation areas and wetland restoration projects.</p>
