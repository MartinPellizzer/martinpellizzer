                    <h1>Isolepis bulbifera</h1>
<p>Isolepis bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often difficult to distinguish from other sedges. The plant is characterized by its ability to form bulb-like structures at the base, which help it survive in fluctuating water levels. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Isolepis bulbifera is typically found in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with consistent humidity.</p>
