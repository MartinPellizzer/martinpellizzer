                            <h1>Isotrema Pseudoutriforme</h1>
<p>Common sunflower, scientifically known as Isotrema pseudoutriforme, is a unique and lesser-known plant species found in specific habitats across certain regions. Despite its name, it does not resemble the typical large sunflowers often seen in gardens or fields. This plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive leaf structure that sets it apart from other members of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing near streams or in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, conservation efforts are increasingly important to protect this rare species.</p>
