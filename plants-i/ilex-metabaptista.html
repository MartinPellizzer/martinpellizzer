<p>Ilex metabaptista, commonly known as the sacred evergreen, is a species of holly native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, bright red berries that persist through the winter. The plant is evergreen, retaining its leaves year-round, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
