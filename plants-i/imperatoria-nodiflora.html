                    <h1>Imperatoria nodiflora</h1>
<p>Imperatoria nodiflora, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Imperatoria nodiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
