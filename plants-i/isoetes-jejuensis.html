<p>Isoetes jejuensis, commonly known as the Jeju watermace, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing sorus located on the underside of its leaves, which are typically narrow and sword-shaped. This species is native to the Korean island of Jeju and thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject in botanical research.</p>
<p>Isoetes jejuensis is also notable for its role in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
