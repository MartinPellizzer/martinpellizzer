                    <h1>Idria</h1>
<p>Idria, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a striking aquatic plant with large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of rivers. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Idria is notable for its ability to purify water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its symbolic significance in Egyptian culture further highlights its botanical and cultural importance.</p>
