                    <h1>Inga cauliflora</h1>
<p>Inga cauliflora, commonly known as the red mulberry, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically consumed fresh or used in jams and beverages. It is also notable for its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and older branches.</p>
<p>This unique growth pattern makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research.</p>
