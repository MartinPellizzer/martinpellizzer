<p>Isoetes vermiculata, commonly known as the basket waternymph, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, strap-shaped leaves that form a dense, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the upper surface of the leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to the substrate.</p>
<p>Isoetes vermiculata is often found in nutrient-poor waters and is an indicator species for oligotrophic conditions.</p>
