                    <h1>Icica unifoliolata</h1>
<p>Icica unifoliolata, commonly known as the single-leaf icica, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated leaf that emerges directly from the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions and its role in the local ecosystem.</p>
