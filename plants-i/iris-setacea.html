                    <h1>Iris setacea</h1>
<p>Iris setacea, commonly known as the desert iris, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Iris setacea plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
