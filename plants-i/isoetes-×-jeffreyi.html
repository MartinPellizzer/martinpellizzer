<p>Isoetes × jeffreyi, commonly known as the Jeffrey's watermilfoil, is a hybrid species within the genus Isoetes, which belongs to the order Sphenopsida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a structure called a strobilus. The plant is aquatic, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its morphology includes a rosette-like arrangement of leaves, with the sporangia forming a distinct, often floating, structure.</p>
