                    <h1>Ipomoea kerberi</h1>
<p>Ipomoea kerberi, commonly known as the Kerber's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and twining habit. It blooms during the day, hence its common name, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
