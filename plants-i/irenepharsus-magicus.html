                    <h1>Irenepharsus magicus</h1>
<p>Irenepharsus magicus, commonly known as the Starlight Fern, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>Its most distinctive feature is its bioluminescent fronds, which emit a soft, blue glow at night, aiding in its nocturnal pollination by moon-sensitive moths. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires a specific mineral-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are spiral-shaped and can unfurl in response to touch, a trait that has led to its mythical reputation.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Irenepharsus magicus is highly endangered due to habitat destruction and over-collection.</p>
