<p>Isoetes tuckermanii subsp.</p>
<p>acadiensis, commonly known as the Acadian watermilfoil, is a rare aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the watermilfoil family (Podostemaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater streams and rivers, anchored by its rhizomes to the substrate. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne on short stalks and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
