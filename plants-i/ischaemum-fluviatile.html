                    <h1>Ischaemum fluviatile</h1>
<p>Ischaemum fluviatile, commonly known as rivergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the surface of muddy or sandy soils in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in other moist, nutrient-rich areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
