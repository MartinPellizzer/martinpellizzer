<p>Isoetes ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a central umbel. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are usually long and ribbon-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Isoetes ekmanii plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
