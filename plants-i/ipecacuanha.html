                    <h1>Ipecacuanha</h1>
<p>Ipecacuanha, commonly known as the vomiting herb, is a plant native to the Caribbean and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and has opposite, ovate leaves. Its most notable feature is the presence of a bitter, stimulant-rich sap that has been historically used in medicinal preparations.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic properties, it is now primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
