                    <h1>Ischyrolepis sabulosa</h1>
<p>Ischyrolepis sabulosa, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces, allowing it to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which together enable it to photosynthesize and survive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is often found on sandy soils and rocky outcrops, particularly in regions with high salinity and low moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Ischyrolepis sabulosa is an indicator species for assessing environmental conditions in coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>
