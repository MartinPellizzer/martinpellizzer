                    <h1>Isochilus linearis var. unilateralis</h1>
<p>Isochilus linearis var. unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided grass vellum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forest understories. Its unique feature is the asymmetrical arrangement of its inflorescence, which gives it the common name "one-sided.".</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
