                    <h1>Iris ruthenica var. uniglumis</h1>
<p>Iris ruthenica var. uniglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features grass-like, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three downward-curving sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to high-altitude habitats.</p>
