<p>Isanthera eximia, commonly known as the red-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Isanthera eximia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in desert and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying xerophytic adaptations in arid regions.</p>
