                    <h1>Illecebrum angustifolium</h1>
<p>Illecebrum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that attach to host plants. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
