                    <h1>Iris ventricosa</h1>
<p>Iris ventricosa, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, upright stems that bear showy, violet-blue to white flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant has broad, grass-like leaves that are often hairy and grow in dense clusters at the base. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>Iris ventricosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
