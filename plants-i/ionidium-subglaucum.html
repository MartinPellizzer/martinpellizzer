<p>Ionidium subglaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf ionidium, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects.</p>
