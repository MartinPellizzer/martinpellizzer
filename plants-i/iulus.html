                    <h1>Iulus</h1>
<p>Iulus, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to various parts of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
<p>Iulus plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae.</p>
