<p>Indigastrum costatum subsp.</p>
<p>macrum, commonly known as the broad-leafed indigastrum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate leaves with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with a preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
