                    <h1>Isoloba</h1>
<p>Isoloba, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a silvery appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Isoloba produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
