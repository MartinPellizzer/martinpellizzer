<p>Common red brome, scientifically known as Iranecio paucilobus, is a striking annual grass native to the western United States. This plant is characterized by its vivid red seed heads that stand out against its green foliage. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Common red brome plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in its native range.</p>
