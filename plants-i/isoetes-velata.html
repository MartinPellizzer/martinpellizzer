<p>Isoetes velata, commonly known as the velvet watermoss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance due to the fine, hair-like structures covering its fronds. This plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in still or slow-moving waters. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are typically clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Isoetes velata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
