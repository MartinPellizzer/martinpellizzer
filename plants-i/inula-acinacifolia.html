                    <h1>Inula acinacifolia</h1>
<p>Inula acinacifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf inula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, adorned with lance-shaped, serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, arranged in a spherical inflorescence. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Inula acinacifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
