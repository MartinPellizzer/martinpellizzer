                    <h1>Ilysanthes refracta</h1>
<p>Ilysanthes refracta, commonly known as the glassy bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, bell-shaped petals that refract light, giving it a unique visual appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a striking display of blue and violet hues.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilysanthes refracta is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
