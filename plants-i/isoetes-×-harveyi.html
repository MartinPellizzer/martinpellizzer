<p>Isoetes × harveyi, commonly known as the Harvey's watermint, is a hybrid species within the genus Isoetes, which consists of spore-bearing, aquatic or semi-aquatic plants.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, and it produces small, spore-bearing cones. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its spores are released into the water, allowing for dispersal and germination in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Isoetes × harveyi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
