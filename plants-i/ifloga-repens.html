<p>Ifloga repens, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color and small, delicate white or yellow flowers. Its botanical characteristics include trifoliate leaves and a fibrous root system, which contribute to its ability to thrive in damp environments.</p>
