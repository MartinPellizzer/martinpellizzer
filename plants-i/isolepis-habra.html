<p>Isolepis habra, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize muddy or sandy shores.</p>
<p>Isolepis habra plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl.</p>
