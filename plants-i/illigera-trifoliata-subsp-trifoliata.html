<p>Illigera trifoliata subsp.</p>
<p>trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf illigera, is a perennial herb native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
