<p>Icica hostmannii, commonly known as the Hostmann's icica, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with narrow, silvery-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in dense clusters, and it blooms during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Icica hostmannii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
