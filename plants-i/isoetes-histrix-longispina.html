<p>Isoetes histrix longispina, commonly known as the long-spined water clubmoss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiky spores that are borne on long, slender strobilae, which are typically submerged in water. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense mats on the bottom substrate. Its morphology includes narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often spirally arranged around the stem.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
