<p>Iris pumila subsp.</p>
<p>aequiloba, commonly known as the dwarf iris or small iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is known for its hardiness in cooler climates.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader petals and more compact growth habit compared to other iris species.</p>
