                    <h1>Ionidium molle</h1>
<p>Ionidium molle, commonly known as the soft ionidium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the early spring season. The plant has soft, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment. It is often found growing in shaded, moist forest understories where it can thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ionidium molle is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
