                    <h1>Indigofera cryptantha var. desmodioides</h1>
<p>Indigofera cryptantha var. desmodioides, commonly known as the desert indigo or desert bean, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which can improve soil fertility in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
