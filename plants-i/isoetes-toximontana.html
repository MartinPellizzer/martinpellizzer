<p>Isoetes toximontana, commonly known as the toxic mountain watermilfoil, is a member of the water fern family (Isoetaceae).</p>
<p>It is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its ribbon-like, thread-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in the southeastern United States, particularly in swampy and slow-moving water bodies. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering water quality.</p>
