<p>Isolepis exigua, commonly known as slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in restoration projects due to their ability to prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Isolepis exigua plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
