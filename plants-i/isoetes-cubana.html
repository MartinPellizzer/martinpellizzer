                    <h1>Isoetes cubana</h1>
<p>Isoetes cubana, commonly known as the Cuban water fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense mat on the bottom of shallow, freshwater habitats. The plant is closely related to other species in the genus Isoetes, which are known for their unique, spore-producing structures called sporangia. Isoetes cubana typically grows in still or slow-moving water, such as ponds and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for assessing water quality in its native range.</p>
