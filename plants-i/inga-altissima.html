                    <h1>Inga altissima</h1>
<p>Inga altissima, commonly known as the "giant arrowroot" or "sweet acacia," is a fast-growing tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by pods containing edible seeds. Its roots have a high starch content, making it a valuable food source in some regions.</p>
<p>Inga altissima is also used in agroforestry for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, enhancing soil fertility.</p>
