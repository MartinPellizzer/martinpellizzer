                    <h1>Ida locusta</h1>
<p>Ida locusta, commonly known as the desert locust, is a short-lived annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh conditions, it plays a significant role in desert ecosystems.</p>
