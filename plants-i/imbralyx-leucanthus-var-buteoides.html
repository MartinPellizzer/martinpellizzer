                    <h1>Imbralyx leucanthus var. buteoides</h1>
<p>Imbralyx leucanthus var. buteoides, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that open at night and close by dawn, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with silvery-gray foliage that reflects moonlight, giving it its common name. Its flowers are tubular with a distinctive, waxy texture and emit a faint, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
