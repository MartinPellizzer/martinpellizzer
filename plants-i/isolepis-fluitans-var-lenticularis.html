                    <h1>Isolepis fluitans var. lenticularis</h1>
<p>Isolepis fluitans var. lenticularis, commonly known as the floating flat sedge, is a variant of the floating sedge species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and the presence of small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats on the surface of water bodies. Its leaves are flat and ribbon-like, which helps it float and stabilize in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
