<p>Isoetes tennesseensis, commonly known as the Tennessee watermoccasin, is a rare aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations along its rhizome. The plant has a unique morphology, with leaf-like structures called fronds that are typically narrow and strap-shaped. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Tennessee and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
