<p>Isachne mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Mauritius and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers.

<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
