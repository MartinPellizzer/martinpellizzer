                    <h1>Inga nitens</h1>
<p>Inga nitens, commonly known as the yellow inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate, and its showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Inga nitens is a fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 15 meters, making it a valuable component of the forest canopy.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a fibrous pod, and the plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
