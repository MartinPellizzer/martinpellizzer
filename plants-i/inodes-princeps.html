                    <h1>Inodes princeps</h1>
<p>Inodes princeps, commonly known as the royal indole, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and a unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a crown. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and waxy, with a subtle iridescence that becomes more pronounced in sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Inodes princeps is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
