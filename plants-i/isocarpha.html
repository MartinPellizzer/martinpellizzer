                    <h1>Isocarpha</h1>
<p>Isocarpha, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either sessile or short-petioled, and their flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in a composite head. Isocarpha species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their hairy stems and capsule-like fruits that release seeds through a mechanism similar to that of true dandelions.</p>
