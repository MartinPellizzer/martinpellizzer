                    <h1>Isoleucas arabica</h1>
<p>Isoleucas arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a species native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting adaptations to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its potential, it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes due to its low yield and specific environmental requirements.</p>
