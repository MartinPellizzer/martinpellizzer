                    <h1>Iris pseudacorus f. submersa</h1>
<p>Iris pseudacorus f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged yellow flag iris, is a variant of the yellow flag iris native to Europe.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its fully submerged growth habit, with leaves and flowers entirely underwater. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are often partially submerged, adapted to its aquatic environment.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
