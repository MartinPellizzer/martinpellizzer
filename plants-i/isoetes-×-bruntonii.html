                    <h1>Isoetes × bruntonii</h1>
<p>Isoetes × bruntonii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes, which includes species of spore-bearing ferns.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, sword-shaped leaves that are adapted for underwater environments. The plant produces sporangia on specialized stalks, which release spores into the water for reproduction. It typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Isoetes × bruntonii is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecosystem health.</p>
