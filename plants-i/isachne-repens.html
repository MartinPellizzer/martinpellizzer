<p>Isachne repens, commonly known as creeping isachne, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
