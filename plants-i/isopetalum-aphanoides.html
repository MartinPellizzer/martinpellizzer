                    <h1>Isopetalum aphanoides</h1>
<p>Isopetalum aphanoides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a small, flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its wiry stems. The plant has a compact growth habit and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Isopetalum aphanoides is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
