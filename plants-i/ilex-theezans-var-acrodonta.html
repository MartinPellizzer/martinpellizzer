<p>Ilex theezans var. acrodonta, commonly known as the acrodont ilex, is a rare and distinctive species of holly native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a sought-after plant for botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
