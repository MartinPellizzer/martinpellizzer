<p>Isachne virgata, commonly known as the slender grass or narrowleaf silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a silver-gray sheen, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>Isachne virgata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
