<p>Isoetes iapygia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located at the tips of its leaf-like structures. This plant is native to freshwater environments in southern Africa, particularly in regions with still or slow-moving water. Isoetes iapygia has a distinctive appearance with its narrow, ribbon-like leaves and is often found in shallow, muddy habitats.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
