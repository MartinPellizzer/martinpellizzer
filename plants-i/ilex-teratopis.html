                    <h1>Ilex teratopis</h1>
<p>Ilex teratopis, commonly known as the twisted holly, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, twisted growth pattern, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, dark green leaves that are typically clustered in whorls along its stems. Its small, red berries are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex teratopis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
