<p>Iotasperma sessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desert shrub, is a hardy plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, sessile leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
