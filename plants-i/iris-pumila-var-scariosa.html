                    <h1>Iris pumila var. scariosa</h1>
<p>Iris pumila var. scariosa, commonly known as the scaly dwarf iris, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in early spring. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>The varietal name "scariosa" refers to the scaly appearance of its leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
