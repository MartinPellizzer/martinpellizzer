<p>Itasina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or purple in color. Itasina is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like material, which aids in their dispersal by wind.</p>
