                    <h1>Isoetes histrix var. subinermis</h1>
<p>Isoetes histrix var. subinermis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water horsetail, is a variant of the water horsetail species native to freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its slender, spore-bearing stems and reduced leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of I. histrix.</p>
