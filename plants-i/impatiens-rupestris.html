                    <h1>Impatiens rupestris</h1>
<p>Impatiens rupestris, commonly known as the rock impatiens, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its fleshy, succulent-like leaves help it store water, adapting it to its dry environment.</p>
<p>Impatiens rupestris is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
