<p>Ilex asprella var. megalophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is typically evergreen, with a dense, bushy growth habit that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental planting.</p>
