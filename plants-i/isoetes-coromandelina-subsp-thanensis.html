<p>Isoetes coromandelina subsp.</p>
<p>thanensis, commonly known as the Thanetis watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that form dense, floating mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a sporophyll, which bears spores for propagation. It is often found in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and stable ecological conditions.</p>
