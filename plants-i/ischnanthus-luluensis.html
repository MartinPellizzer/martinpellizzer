                    <h1>Ischnanthus luluensis</h1>
<p>Ischnanthus luluensis, commonly known as the Lulu's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in dense clusters. The plant has slender, wiry stems and possesses a unique root system adapted to its rocky, nutrient-poor habitat. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ischnanthus luluensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
