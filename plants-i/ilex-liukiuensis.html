<p>Ilex liukiuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex liukiuensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
