                    <h1>Inula ammophila</h1>
<p>Inula ammophila, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in dunes and coastal habitats. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Inula ammophila plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
