<p>Isoetes spannagelii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, leaf-like structures called stigmaria, which are used for anchoring the plant in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant produces sporangia on specialized stalks, which release spores into the water for reproduction. It is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Isoetes spannagelii is considered a rare and ancient species, often indicating stable, undisturbed aquatic habitats.</p>
