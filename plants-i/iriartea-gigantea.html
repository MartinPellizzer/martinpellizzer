<p>Iriartea gigantea, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the cycad family, known for its ancient lineage and unique morphology. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk covered in thick, fibrous bark, and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Iriartea gigantea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
