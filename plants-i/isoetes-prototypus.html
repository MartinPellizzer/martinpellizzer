<p>Isoetes prototypus, commonly known as the southern water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, ribbon-like leaves that form a mat on the bottom of freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in spore-bearing cones called strobili.</p>
<p>Isoetes prototypus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
