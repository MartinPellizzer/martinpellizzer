<p>Isoetes tenella var. braunii, commonly known as the Braun's water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that form dense, floating mats on the water surface. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
