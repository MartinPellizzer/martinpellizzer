<p>Ischyrolepis leptoclados, commonly known as the slender-leaf ischyrolepis, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Araliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ischyrolepis leptoclados is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
