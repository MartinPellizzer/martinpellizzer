<p>Icomum hockii, commonly known as the Hockii lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is commonly found on tree bark and rocks in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>Icomum hockii is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
