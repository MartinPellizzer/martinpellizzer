                    <h1>Ixodia flindersica</h1>
<p>Ixodia flindersica, commonly known as the Flinders Island lichen, is a unique lichen species found primarily on the island of Flinders in the Bass Strait, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The lichen's thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on limestone or sandstone substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and ecological specificity, Ixodia flindersica is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species.</p>
