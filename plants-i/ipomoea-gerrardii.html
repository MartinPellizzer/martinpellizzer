                    <h1>Ipomoea gerrardii</h1>
<p>Ipomoea gerrardii, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can become invasive if not managed.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
