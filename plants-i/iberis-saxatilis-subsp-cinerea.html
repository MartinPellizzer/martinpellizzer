<p>Iberis saxatilis subsp.</p>
<p>cinerea, commonly known as the gray rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the rocky and alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its harsh, arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices and on slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
