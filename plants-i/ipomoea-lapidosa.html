                    <h1>Ipomoea lapidosa</h1>
<p>Ipomoea lapidosa, commonly known as the rock morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name.</p>
