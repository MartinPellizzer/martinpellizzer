<p>Isolepis marginata, commonly known as the tufted spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense mats that help stabilize riverbanks and prevent erosion. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to the structural integrity of its habitat.</p>
<p>Isolepis marginata plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife in its native ecosystems.</p>
