                    <h1>Isolepis inclinata</h1>
<p>Isolepis inclinata, commonly known as the leaning spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Isolepis inclinata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
