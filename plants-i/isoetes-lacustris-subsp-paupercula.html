<p>Isoetes lacustris subsp.</p>
<p>paupercula, commonly known as the lake watermace, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spiky, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on specialized leaves called sporophylls.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to freshwater environments, often inhabiting shallow lakes and ponds with muddy substrates. Its morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and narrow, ribbon-like leaves.</p>
