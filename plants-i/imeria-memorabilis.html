                    <h1>Imeria memorabilis</h1>
<p>Imeria memorabilis, commonly known as the memory flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-color petals that shift hue depending on the time of day, a phenomenon attributed to its unique pigmentation. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom only during specific lunar phases, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Imeria memorabilis is considered a conservation priority.</p>
