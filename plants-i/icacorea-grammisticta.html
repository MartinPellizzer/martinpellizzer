                    <h1>Icacorea grammisticta</h1>
<p>Icacorea grammisticta, commonly known as the New Zealand broom, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in coastal and disturbed habitats, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
