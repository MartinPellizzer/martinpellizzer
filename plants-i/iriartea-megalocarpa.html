<p>Iriartea megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, slow-growing cycad native to the rainforests of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, fern-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters, making it one of the tallest cycads. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its unique, palm-like trunk and its role in traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>
