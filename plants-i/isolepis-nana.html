                    <h1>Isolepis nana</h1>
<p>Isolepis nana, commonly known as dwarf spike-rush, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with dense, grass-like foliage that forms a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Isolepis nana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
