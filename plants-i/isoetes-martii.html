<p>Isoetes martii, commonly known as the Martii watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on specialized leaves called sporophylls. This plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds, where it anchors itself to the substrate with its rhizomes. Its morphology includes long, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Isoetes martii is also notable for its ability to survive in low-nutrient conditions, making it a resilient species in various aquatic habitats.</p>
