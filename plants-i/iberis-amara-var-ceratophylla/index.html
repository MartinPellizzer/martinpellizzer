                            <h1>Iberis Amara Var. Ceratophylla</h1>
<p>Crested iberis, scientifically known as Iberis amara var. ceratophylla, is a unique and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. Its most distinctive feature is the tuft of bristly foliage that crowns its stems, giving it an otherworldly appearance. This hardy species thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Despite its rugged environment, it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to its surroundings. Its resilience and ornamental value have made it a subject of interest for botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
