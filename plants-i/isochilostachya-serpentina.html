<p>Isochilostachya serpentina, commonly known as the serpentine grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
