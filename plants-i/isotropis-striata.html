<p>Isotropis striata, commonly known as the striped isoet, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Isoetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely striated, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as lakes and streams, where it can be found submerged or partially submerged. Its morphology is adapted for efficient gas exchange in water, with small, scale-like structures covering the leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>Isotropis striata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
