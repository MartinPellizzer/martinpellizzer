<p>Iria triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered morning glory, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial vine, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that aid in climbing.
