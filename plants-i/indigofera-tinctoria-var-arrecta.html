                    <h1>Indigofera tinctoria var. arrecta</h1>
<p>Indigofera tinctoria var. arrecta, commonly known as the African indigo plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a leguminous shrub characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its most significant botanical feature is the production of indigo dye from its leaves, which has been historically used in textile industries.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and traditional dyeing purposes.</p>
