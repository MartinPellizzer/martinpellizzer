<p>Ischaemum indicum var. malacophyllum, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
