                    <h1>Ivesia rhypara</h1>
<p>Ivesia rhypara, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Ivesia rhypara plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
