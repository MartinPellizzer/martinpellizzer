<p>Ilex arenicola, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>

The plant features small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a glossy appearance. Its small white flowers appear in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for local wildlife.</p>
