<p>Itatiaia cleistopetala, commonly known as the Brazilian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. The flowers are cleistogamous, meaning they are self-fertilizing and often remain closed, which is an adaptation for ensuring reproductive success in shaded environments. Itatiaia cleistopetala is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
