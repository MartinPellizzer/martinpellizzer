                    <h1>Imperata</h1>
<p>Imperata, commonly known as cogongrass, is a perennial grass native to Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and tall, reddish-purple foliage. The plant produces large, spadix-like inflorescences that are often covered in tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Imperata is highly invasive and can dominate native vegetation in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots are used in traditional crafts and as a source of thatch.</p>
