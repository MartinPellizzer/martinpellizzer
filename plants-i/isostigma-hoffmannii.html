<p>Isostigma hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a single, short-lived flower. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it grows.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
