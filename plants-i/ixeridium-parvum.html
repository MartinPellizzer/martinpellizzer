<p>Ixeridium parvum, commonly known as the small-flowered sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Ixeridium parvum is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem.</p>
