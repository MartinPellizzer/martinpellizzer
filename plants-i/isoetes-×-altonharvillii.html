                    <h1>Isoetes × altonharvillii</h1>
<p>Isoetes × altonharvillii, commonly known as the hybrid water clover, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes, which includes spike mosses.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Isoetes altonensis and Isoetes harvillii, both of which are native to North America. The plant is characterized by its intricate, spirally arranged spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are typically submerged in water. It thrives in shallow, still waters with muddy or sandy substrates, often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
