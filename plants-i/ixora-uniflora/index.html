                            <h1>Ixora Uniflora</h1>
<p>Ixora uniflora is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the year. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and tropical forests. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The species is also valued for its ability to withstand partial shade and poor soil conditions. Despite its beauty, Ixora uniflora remains relatively underappreciated compared to other flowering plants in the genus.</p>
