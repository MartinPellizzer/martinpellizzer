<p>Icacorea acuminifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Icacorea acuminifolia is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
