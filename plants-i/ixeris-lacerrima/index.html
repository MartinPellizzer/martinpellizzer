                            <h1>Ixeris Lacerrima</h1>
<p>Ixeris, scientifically known as Ixeris lacerrima, is a flowering plant native to East Asia, particularly Japan and China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Ixeris lacerrima is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to drought conditions. Its compact size and vibrant color make it a versatile addition to rock gardens, borders, and landscape designs.</p>
