                    <h1>Isoetes × foveolata</h1>
<p>Isoetes × foveolata, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sporangia. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on spores for reproduction rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Isoetes × foveolata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
