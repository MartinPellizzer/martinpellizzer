                <h1>Ibania retinervia</h1>
<p>Ibania retinervia, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and filter salt from water. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that reduces water loss in saline environments. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Ibania retinervia plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
