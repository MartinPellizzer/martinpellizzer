<p>It belongs to the family Isoetaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense mat on the forest floor. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its unique morphology includes a compact, rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
