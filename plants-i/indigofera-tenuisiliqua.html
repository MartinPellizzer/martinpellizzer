<p>Indigofera tenuisiliqua, commonly known as the slender indigo plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. It has a fibrous root system and can grow up to 1â€“2 meters in height, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening.</p>
