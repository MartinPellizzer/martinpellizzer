                    <h1>Ischaemum polystachyum var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Ischaemum polystachyum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender,丛生 stems that often form dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spike-like clusters, bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the two parent species, Ischaemum polystachyum and Ischaemum intermedium.</p>
