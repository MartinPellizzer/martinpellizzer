                    <h1>Ilex soderstromii var. ovata</h1>
<p>Ilex soderstromii var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate holly, is a rare and distinctive evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, ovate-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical collections.</p>
