                    <h1>Ipomoea floribunda</h1>
<p>Ipomoea floribunda, commonly known as the clustered morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can climb supports with its strong, wiry stems.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
