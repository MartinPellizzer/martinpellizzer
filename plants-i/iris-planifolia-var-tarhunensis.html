                    <h1>Iris planifolia var. tarhunensis</h1>
<p>Iris planifolia var. tarhunensis, commonly known as the Tarhun Iris, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
