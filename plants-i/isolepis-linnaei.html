                    <h1>Isolepis linnaei</h1>
<p>Isolepis linnaei, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Isolepis linnaei plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to soil structure and supporting biodiversity.</p>
