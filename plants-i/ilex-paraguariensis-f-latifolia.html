                    <h1>Ilex paraguariensis f. latifolia</h1>
<p>Ilex paraguariensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved yerba mate, is a variant of the yerba mate plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and is typically found in the subtropical regions of Paraguay and Brazil. The plant is an evergreen shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. Its leaves are used to prepare the traditional South American beverage known as mate.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this form make it distinct from the standard Ilex paraguariensis, particularly in leaf morphology and growth habit.</p>
