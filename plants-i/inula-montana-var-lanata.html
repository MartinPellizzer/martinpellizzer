The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent and has a robust root system that helps it thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Its hairy leaves and stems are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
