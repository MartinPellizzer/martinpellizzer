<p>Indosasa solearis, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its succulent leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Indosasa solearis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
