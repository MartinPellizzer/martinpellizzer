                    <h1>Isatis tinctoria f. glabrifolia</h1>
<p>Isatis tinctoria f. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved woad, is a variant of the traditional woad plant.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. It is primarily cultivated for its blue dye-producing leaves, which were historically used in textile industries.</p>
<p>This form is less common than the typical woad but shares many botanical features with its parent species.</p>
