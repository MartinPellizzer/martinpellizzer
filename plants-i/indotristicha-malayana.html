<p>Indotristicha malayana, commonly known as the Malayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
