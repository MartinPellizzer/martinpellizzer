                    <h1>Ilex × belgica</h1>
<p>Ilex × belgica, commonly known as the Belgian holly, is a hybrid evergreen shrub or small tree resulting from the cross between Ilex aquifolium (European holly) and Ilex crenata (Japanese holly).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Ilex × belgica exhibits a range of variability in leaf shape and size.</p>
