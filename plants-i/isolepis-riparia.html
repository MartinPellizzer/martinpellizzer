<p>Isolepis riparia, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along riverbanks and lake shores. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Isolepis riparia plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
