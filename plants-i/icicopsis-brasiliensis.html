                    <h1>Icicopsis brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Icicopsis brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the dry season, typically in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
