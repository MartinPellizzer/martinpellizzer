                    <h1>Isoetes histrix var. desquamata</h1>
<p>Isoetes histrix var. desquamata, commonly known as the scaly water clubmoss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves that form dense, ribbon-like structures. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to the substrate. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, club-shaped formations along the leaf bases.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its scaly appearance on the leaf surfaces, which gives it its botanical name.</p>
