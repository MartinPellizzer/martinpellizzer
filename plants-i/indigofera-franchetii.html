                    <h1>Indigofera franchetii</h1>
<p>Indigofera franchetii, commonly known as Chinese indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to China and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and purple to blue flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous pod, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>While not traditionally used for dye production like other indigo species, it shares botanical similarities with its more well-known relatives.</p>
