<p>Ischyrolepis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are short and extensively branched, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its native ecosystems.</p>
