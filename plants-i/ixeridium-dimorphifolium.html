<p>Ixeridium dimorphifolium, commonly known as the two-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically divided into two distinct forms, one basal and one upper, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Ixeridium dimorphifolium is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
