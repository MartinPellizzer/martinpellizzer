                            <h1>Iberis Jordanii</h1>
<p>Jordan's iberis, scientifically known as Iberis jordanii, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the rocky regions of Jordan. This low-growing perennial is characterized by its dense clusters of bright white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in limestone soils and rocky crevices. The plant is not only an important part of its local ecosystem but also holds cultural significance in the region. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Iberis jordanii is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
