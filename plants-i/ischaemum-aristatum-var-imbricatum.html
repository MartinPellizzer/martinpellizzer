<p>Ischaemum aristatum var. imbricatum, commonly known as the bristly barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a common weed and an important species in ecological studies.</p>
