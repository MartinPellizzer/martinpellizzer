                    <h1>Iberis pinnata var. bicorymbifera</h1>
<p>Iberis pinnata var. bicorymbifera, commonly known as the two-corymb wild cabbage, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in compact corymbs. The leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine layer of whitish, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar structural and chemical traits.</p>
