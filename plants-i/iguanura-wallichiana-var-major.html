<p>Iguanura wallichiana var. major, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, mountainous environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
