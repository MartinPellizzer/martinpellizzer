                    <h1>Imperatoria palustris</h1>
<p>Imperatoria palustris, commonly known as swamp sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across muddy or marshy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by tiny, triangular seed capsules. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Imperatoria palustris is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
