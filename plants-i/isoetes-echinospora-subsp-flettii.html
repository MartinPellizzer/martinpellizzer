<p>Isoetes echinospora subsp.</p>
<p>flettii, commonly known as the Flett's quillwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its spore-bearing stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically submerged in water.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to freshwater habitats in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on specialized stems called strobils.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
