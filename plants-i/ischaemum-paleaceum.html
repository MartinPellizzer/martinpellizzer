<p>Ischaemum paleaceum, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and stream banks. The plant has slender,丛生 stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow with a smooth surface. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, producing small, pale green to brown flowers.</p>
<p>Ischaemum paleaceum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators.</p>
