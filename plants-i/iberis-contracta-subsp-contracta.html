<p>Iberis contracta subsp.</p>
<p>contracta, commonly known as the winter flowering rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with dark green, succulent leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ability to provide early seasonal color in gardens and rockeries.</p>
