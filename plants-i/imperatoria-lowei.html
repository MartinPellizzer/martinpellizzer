<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically red or purple in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Imperatoria lowei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
