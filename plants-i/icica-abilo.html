<p>Icica abilo, commonly known as the golden spire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow inflorescence, which resembles a spire and blooms during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, Icica abilo is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
