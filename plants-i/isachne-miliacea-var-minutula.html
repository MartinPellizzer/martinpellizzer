                    <h1>Isachne miliacea var. minutula</h1>
<p>Isachne miliacea var. minutula, commonly known as the small-seeded barnyardgrass, is a grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and rice fields. The plant has slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. Its seeds are minute and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this plant make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for crop management.</p>
