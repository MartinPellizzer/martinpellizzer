<p>Iris dierinckii, commonly known as the Dierckens iris, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing in dense clumps, and it prefers well-drained, moist soils in shaded to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
