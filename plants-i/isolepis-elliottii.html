<p>Isolepis elliottii, commonly known as Elliott's spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Isolepis elliottii is an important component of wetland ecosystems, playing a role in water filtration and supporting biodiversity.</p>
