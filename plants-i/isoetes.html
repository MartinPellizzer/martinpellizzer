                    <h1>Isoetes</h1>
<p>Isoetes, commonly known as water clover, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a rosette-like arrangement on the leaf-like structures called megaphylls. Isoetes species are typically found in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands, where they play a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems. Their morphology includes a rootstock with rhizomes and a crown of leaves that can be submerged or emergent, depending on the species.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ancient lineage, with fossil records dating back to the Devonian period.</p>
