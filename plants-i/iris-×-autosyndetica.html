                    <h1>Iris × autosyndetica</h1>
<p>Iris × autosyndetica, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris pseudacorus and Iris sibirica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bright yellow flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plant species and alter local ecosystems.</p>
