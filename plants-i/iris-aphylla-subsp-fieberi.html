<p>Iris aphylla subsp.</p>
<p>fieberi, commonly known as the Fieber's root iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its robust rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense basal rosette.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
