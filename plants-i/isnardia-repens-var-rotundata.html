                    <h1>Isnardia repens var. rotundata</h1>
<p>Isnardia repens var. rotundata, commonly known as the broadleaf carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the ground. The leaves are ovate to round in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
