                    <h1>Ischnurus</h1>
<p>Ischnurus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Ischnurus typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
