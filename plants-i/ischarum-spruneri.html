<p>Ischarum spruneri, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Ischarum spruneri is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
