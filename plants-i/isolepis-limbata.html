<p>Isolepis limbata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Isolepis limbata thrives in saturated soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common indicator species for wetland health and biodiversity.</p>
