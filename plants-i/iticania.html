<p>Iticania, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that have a distinctive silvery sheen, which helps reflect excess sunlight. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often blooming during the warmer months. Iticania thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
