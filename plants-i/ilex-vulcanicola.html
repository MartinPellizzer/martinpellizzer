The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of volcanic regions. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for native birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex vulcanicola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
