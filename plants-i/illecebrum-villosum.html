<p>Illecebrum villosum, commonly known as the silky thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically orange to red in color, which contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. Illecebrum villosum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it has a somewhat aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and occasionally invasive in certain regions.</p>
