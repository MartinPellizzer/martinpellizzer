                    <h1>Ipomoea capitiformis</h1>
<p>Ipomoea capitiformis, commonly known as the clustered morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or violet. The plant blooms throughout the growing season, often in the morning, and relies on pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open when mature to disperse the seeds.</p>
