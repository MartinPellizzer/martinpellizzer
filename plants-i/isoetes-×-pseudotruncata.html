<p>Isoetes × pseudotruncata, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a species belonging to the genus Isoetes, which includes spike mosses.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing spirogyroid strobila, which is typically found at the tip of the plant's sporophylls. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its morphology includes a rosette-like structure of leaf-like structures called splauns, which are modified leaves.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique reproductive structures and ecological adaptations.</p>
