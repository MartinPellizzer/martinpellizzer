                            <h1>Iva Annua Var. Macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Iva annua var. macrocarpa is a unique variant of the common marshelder plant known for its distinctive large, showy flowers. This annual herb thrives in wetland environments and is often found along the edges of ponds and streams. Its robust growth and adaptability make it a common sight in moist, disturbed soils across the eastern United States. The plant's showy yellow blooms attract pollinators and contribute to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Despite its beauty, it is often regarded as a weed due to its aggressive spread and resilience.</p>
