                    <h1>Isachne neesiana</h1>
<p>Isachne neesiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Isachne neesiana is often found in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in disturbed soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
