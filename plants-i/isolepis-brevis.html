<p>Isolepis brevis, commonly known as narrow spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Isolepis brevis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
