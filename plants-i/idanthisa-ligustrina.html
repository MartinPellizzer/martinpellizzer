                    <h1>Idanthisa ligustrina</h1>
<p>Idanthisa ligustrina, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, showy flowers that range in color from white to red, depending on the stage of bloom. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>The flowers close at night and on cloudy days, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which helps protect the plant from excessive moisture loss.</p>
