                    <h1>Isoetes hemivelata</h1>
<p>Isoetes hemivelata, commonly known as the velvet spike-moss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes in the family Isoetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiky foliage that resembles a cluster of green needles, often forming a compact rosette near the water's surface. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered at the base of the plant and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Isoetes hemivelata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
