                    <h1>Isotrema xuanlienense</h1>
<p>Isotrema xuanlienense, commonly known as the Xuanlien mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus, through a specialized root system called haustoria. It derives some of its nutrients from the host but also performs photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
