                    <h1>Icica lucida</h1>
<p>Icica lucida, commonly known as the shining icica, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Icica lucida is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
