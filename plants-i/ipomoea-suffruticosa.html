<p>Ipomoea suffruticosa, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in the morning.
