                    <h1>Iris imberbis</h1>
<p>Iris imberbis, commonly known as the hairless iris, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and lacks the tuft of hair typically found on the rhizomes of other iris species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
