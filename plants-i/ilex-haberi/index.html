                            <h1>Ilex Haberi</h1>
<p>Haber's holly, scientifically known as Ilex haberi, is a rare and unique evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Texas. This plant is prized for its striking glossy leaves and vibrant red berries that attract wildlife during the winter months. Despite its ornamental value, Ilex haberi is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection, making it a species of conservation concern. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in rocky or wooded areas. Due to its limited distribution, efforts are underway to protect and propagate this rare botanical treasure.</p>
