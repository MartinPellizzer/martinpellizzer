<p>Isidrogalvia borealis, commonly known as the Northern Skybloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It possesses a unique rosette structure with thick, waxy leaves that help retain heat in extreme cold. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only during the brief summer season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from permafrost, and it is pollinated by specialized insects active in the short growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, Isidrogalvia borealis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
