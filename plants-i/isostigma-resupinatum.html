<p>Isostigma resupinatum, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, cushion-like growths on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly packed, leathery thallus that ranges in color from pale yellow to dark green. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi for nutrition. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
