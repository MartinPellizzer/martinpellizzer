<p>Ixeris riparia, commonly known as the water thistle, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, silver-white hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in moist or aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Ixeris riparia is often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes, where it contributes to stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
