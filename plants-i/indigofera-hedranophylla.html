                    <h1>Indigofera hedranophylla</h1>
<p>Indigofera hedranophylla, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain seeds, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many parts of its range.</p>
