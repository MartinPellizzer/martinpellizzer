                    <h1>Inga globosa</h1>
<p>Inga globosa, commonly known as the "globular inga," is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its clustered, globular inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellowish-white flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Inga globosa is also valued in agroforestry systems for its nitrogen-fixing abilities and shade-providing canopy.</p>
