<p>Isolepis paniculata, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, branched inflorescences that produce small, spike-like flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that stabilize shoreline habitats. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Isolepis paniculata plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
