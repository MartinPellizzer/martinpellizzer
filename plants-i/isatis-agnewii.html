<p>Isatis agnewii, commonly known as Agnew's woad, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Isatis agnewii is often found in moist soils near streams or in wetlands, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Its historical use in dye production, similar to the more famous woad plant, has also been noted in some botanical studies.</p>
