<p>Ichnanthus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>Ichnanthus pubescens plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
