                    <h1>Isoptera</h1>
<p>Isoptera, commonly known as termites, are social insects belonging to the order Isoptera, which includes over 3,000 species.</p>
<p>They are closely related to cockroaches and play a significant role in ecosystems by breaking down dead wood and plant material. Their diet primarily consists of cellulose, which they digest with the help of symbiotic protozoa in their gut. Termites are often found in colonies with a complex social structure, including a queen, workers, soldiers, and reproductives.</p>
<p>Despite their destructive impact on wooden structures, they contribute to nutrient cycling in soil and forest ecosystems.</p>
