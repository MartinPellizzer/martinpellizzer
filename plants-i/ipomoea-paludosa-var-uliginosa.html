                    <h1>Ipomoea paludosa var. uliginosa</h1>
<p>Ipomoea paludosa var. uliginosa, commonly known as swamp morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces trumpet-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it an aggressive colonizer in wetland environments.</p>
