                    <h1>Iris lutescens var. olbiensis</h1>
<p>Iris lutescens var. olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense Iris, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to golden orange flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
