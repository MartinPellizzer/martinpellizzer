                    <h1>Ischaemum aristatum var. lanuginosum</h1>
<p>Ischaemum aristatum var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control.</p>
