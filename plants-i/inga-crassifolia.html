                    <h1>Inga crassifolia</h1>
<p>Inga crassifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in pendulous clusters. Its fruits are woody pods that split open to release seeds, contributing to its role in forest regeneration.</p>
<p>Inga crassifolia is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and rapid growth.</p>
