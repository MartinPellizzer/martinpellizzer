<p>Isoetes lacustris var. elatior, commonly known as the greater water mace, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are arranged in a spiral pattern along the plant's axis. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow lakes and ponds with muddy substrates. Its leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
