                    <h1>Isotrema bullatum</h1>
<p>Isotrema bullatum, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by inflated, bladder-like pods that contain seeds. Isotrema bullatum is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a distinctive species within the Papilionoideae subfamily.</p>
