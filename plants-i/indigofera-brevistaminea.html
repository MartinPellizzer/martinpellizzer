<p>Indigofera brevistaminea, commonly known as the small-stemmed indigo plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment in agricultural settings.</p>
