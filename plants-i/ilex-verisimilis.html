<p>Ilex verisimilis, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has simple, alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, spherical berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as swamps and hammocks.</p>
<p>The Florida holly is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
