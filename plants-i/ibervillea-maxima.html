                    <h1>Ibervillea maxima</h1>
<p>Ibervillea maxima, commonly known as the giant ibervillea, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, ribbed stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, often with a reddish or greenish hue. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ibervillea maxima is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes.</p>
