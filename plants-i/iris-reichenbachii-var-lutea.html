                    <h1>Iris reichenbachii var. lutea</h1>
<p>Iris reichenbachii var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, topped with showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and grow in dense clumps. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense stands in moist soils.</p>
<p>While it is valued for its ornamental appeal, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
