                    <h1>Inga pyriformis</h1>
<p>Inga pyriformis, commonly known as the round-leaf inga, is a tropical tree belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in moist lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Inga pyriformis is often used in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
