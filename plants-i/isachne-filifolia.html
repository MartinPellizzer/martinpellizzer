<p>Isachne filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf isachne, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a smooth, bluish-green appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, spike-like flowers, which are often inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
