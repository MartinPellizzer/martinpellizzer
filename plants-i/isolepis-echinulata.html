<p>Isolepis echinulata, commonly known as the prickly flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense mats that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to spread and colonize disturbed wetlands.</p>
<p>Isolepis echinulata plays an important role in supporting local wildlife by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
