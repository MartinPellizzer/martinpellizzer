                    <h1>Isoetes sampathkumaranii</h1>
<p>Isoetes sampathkumaranii, commonly known as the Sri Lankan watermace, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found in clusters on specialized leaves called sporophylls. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, often in still or slow-moving water bodies. Its morphology includes a creeping rhizome with leaf-like structures that are adapted for underwater growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
