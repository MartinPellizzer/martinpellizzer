                    <h1>Isolepis moseleyana</h1>
<p>Isolepis moseleyana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, compact tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to the structure of wetland ecosystems.</p>
