<p>Isanthera discolor var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf isanthera, is a variant of the isanthera plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate aesthetic to its appearance. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
