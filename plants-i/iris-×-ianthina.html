                    <h1>Iris × ianthina</h1>
<p>Iris × ianthina, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris sibirica and Iris pallida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a yellow or white beard in the center. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are sword-shaped, narrow, and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
