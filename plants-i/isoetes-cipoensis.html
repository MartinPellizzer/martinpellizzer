<p>Isoetes cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo watermoss, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a structure known as a sorus. The plant is adapted to aquatic environments, with its roots and rhizomes anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates. Its leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, often forming dense mats on the water's surface or submerged in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Isoetes cipoensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
