<p>Impatiens lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous forests. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
