                    <h1>Isolepis echinocephala</h1>
<p>Isolepis echinocephala, commonly known as the spiky flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Isolepis echinocephala is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
