<p>Isidrogalvia moritziana, commonly known as the Moritzian rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, thick rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
