                    <h1>Ionidium glutinosum var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Ionidium glutinosum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stickyweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular substance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation to wet environments.</p>
