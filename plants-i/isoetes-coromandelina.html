<p>Isoetes coromandelina, commonly known as the Coromandel watermoss, is a member of the genus Isoetes, which includes species of spore-bearing plants known as watermosses.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tightly packed, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense rosette. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are located at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Isoetes coromandelina is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
