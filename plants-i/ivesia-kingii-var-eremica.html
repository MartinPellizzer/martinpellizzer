<p>Ivesia kingii var. eremica, commonly known as the desert flax, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping in desert environments.</p>
