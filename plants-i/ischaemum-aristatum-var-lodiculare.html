                    <h1>Ischaemum aristatum var. lodiculare</h1>
<p>Ischaemum aristatum var. lodiculare, commonly known as the slender barnyard grass, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called caryopses, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils.</p>
