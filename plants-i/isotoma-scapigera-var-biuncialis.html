                    <h1>Isotoma scapigera var. biuncialis</h1>
<p>Isotoma scapigera var. biuncialis, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often rise from a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are characterized by their elongated, tubular shape and are often clustered in small groups at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Isotoma scapigera.</p>
