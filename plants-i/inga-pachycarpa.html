                    <h1>Inga pachycarpa</h1>
<p>Inga pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, where it thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. Its fruit is a pod that contains several edible, bean-like seeds, which are often used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>Inga pachycarpa also plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting the growth of other plants in the ecosystem.</p>
