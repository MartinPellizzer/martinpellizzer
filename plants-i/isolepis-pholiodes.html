<p>Isolepis pholiodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, forming dense tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often concealed within the foliage, making it less showy than other grasses.</p>
<p>Isolepis pholiodes plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
