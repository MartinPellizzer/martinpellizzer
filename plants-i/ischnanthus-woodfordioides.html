                    <h1>Ischnanthus woodfordioides</h1>
<p>Ischnanthus woodfordioides, commonly known as the Woodford's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a unique root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Ischnanthus woodfordioides is highly specialized, requiring specific microhabitats and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Its conservation status highlights the fragility of its ecological niche and the need for continued protection.</p>
