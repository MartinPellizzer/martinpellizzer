<p>Imperata spontanea, commonly known as the common blady grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes that form extensive clumps, and its narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Imperata spontanea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
