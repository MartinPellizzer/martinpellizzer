<p>Isoetes cristata, commonly known as the cristate water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the order Isoetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally arranged, spore-bearing leaves that form a rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and shallow lakes. Its spores are released into the water and dispersed by wind or water currents.</p>
<p>Isoetes cristata plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
