<p>Ischaemum aristatum subsp.</p>
<p>barbatum, commonly known as the hairy barnyardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its competitive growth habit.</p>
