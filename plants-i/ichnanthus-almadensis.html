                    <h1>Ichnanthus almadensis</h1>
<p>Ichnanthus almadensis, commonly known as the Almaden beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ichnanthus almadensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
