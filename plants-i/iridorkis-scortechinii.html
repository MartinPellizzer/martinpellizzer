                    <h1>Iridorkis scortechinii</h1>
<p>Iridorkis scortechinii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
