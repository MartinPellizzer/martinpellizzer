<p>Lepidomicrosorium longshengense, commonly known as the Longsheng water fern, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, and is native to Southeast Asia. Its reproductive structures, including small, yellowish sori, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
