<p>Lophiolepis lobelii, commonly known as the Cape York lily, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or near watercourses.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
