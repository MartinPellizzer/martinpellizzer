                    <h1>Lycopodium tristachyum var. sharonense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium tristachyum var. sharonense, commonly known as Sharon's clubmoss, is a rare and unique variant of the clubmoss genus Lycopodium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spirally arranged leaves and distinctive reproductive structures called sporophylls. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte develops from the fusion of male and female gametes, a process typical of bryophytes and primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance.</p>
