                    <h1>Loranthus microcuspis</h1>
<p>Loranthus microcuspis, commonly known as the small-cusped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native range by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various animals.</p>
