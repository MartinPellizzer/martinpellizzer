                    <h1>Lotodes fruticans</h1>
<p>Lotodes fruticans, commonly known as the aquatic buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often forming dense colonies along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Its flowers are yellow and resemble those of the common buttercup, with five petals and numerous stamens.</p>
<p>The species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters, making it a common indicator of eutrophic conditions.</p>
