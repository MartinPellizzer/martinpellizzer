<p>Lasiodiscus mildbraedii subsp.</p>
<p>ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty disc lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its distinctive, disc-like thallus. It typically grows on bark and stone in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The thallus is covered with a dense layer of fungal hyphae, giving it a leathery texture. Its color ranges from pale yellow to reddish-brown, with a prominent, granular upper surface.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its chemical composition, including depsides and depsidones, which contribute to its ecological and potential medicinal significance.</p>
