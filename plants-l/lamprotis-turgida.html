<p>Lamprotis turgida, commonly known as the swollen blister beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Meloidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated body shape and the presence of a hardened, segmented exoskeleton. The beetle is often found in agricultural areas where it feeds on plant material, particularly grasses and legumes. Its larvae, known as triungulate larvae, are parasitic and develop inside the eggs of other beetles.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in both entomology and agricultural pest management due to its ecological and economic impacts.</p>
