                    <h1>Lasianthus puffii</h1>
<p>Lasianthus puffii, commonly known as the pink-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host trees through specialized root structures called haustoria. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
