                    <h1>Lepechiniella lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Lepechiniella lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly lepechiniella, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its slender, branched stems. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
