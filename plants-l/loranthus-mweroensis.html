                    <h1>Loranthus mweroensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus mweroensis, commonly known as the Wero mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, fleshy, often red or orange berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis with its remaining leaves. It is native to eastern Africa, particularly found in countries like Tanzania and Kenya.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
