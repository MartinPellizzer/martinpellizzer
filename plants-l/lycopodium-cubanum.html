<p>Lycopodium cubanum, commonly known as the Cuban clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodium cubanum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and reproductive features make it an important species in the study of ancient plant evolution.</p>
