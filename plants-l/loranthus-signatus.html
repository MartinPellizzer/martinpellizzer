                    <h1>Loranthus signatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus signatus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with dark green, glossy leaves and red, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its flowers are usually small and white or greenish, and it blooms in the spring.</p>
<p>Loranthus signatus plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries.</p>
