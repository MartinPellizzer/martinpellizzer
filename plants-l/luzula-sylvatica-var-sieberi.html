<p>Luzula sylvatica var. sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are often concealed among the foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other Luzula species by its specific morphological traits and geographic distribution.</p>
