<p>Lithops lineata, commonly known as the Narrow-leafed Stone Plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, which help it store water and survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lined with white or pale markings, providing camouflage against the rocky substrate.</p>
<p>Lithops lineata is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
