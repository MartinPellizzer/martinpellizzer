                <h1>Lugaion etnense</h1>
<p>Lugaion etnense, commonly known as the Etna violet, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate purple flowers and slender, hairy stems. The plant thrives in the volcanic soil and mild climate of the region, often growing in rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
