                    <h1>Limnophila rugosa</h1>
<p>Limnophila rugosa, commonly known as the hairy water plant, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Limnophila rugosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
