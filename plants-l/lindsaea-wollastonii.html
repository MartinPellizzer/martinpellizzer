<p>Lindsaea wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Lindsaea wollastonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
