                <h1>Launaea sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Launaea sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping daisy, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its succulent stems and leaves help it store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Launaea sarmentosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
