<p>Liliorhiza piattiana, commonly known as the piattiana orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces intricate, spurred petals that are typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liliorhiza piattiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
