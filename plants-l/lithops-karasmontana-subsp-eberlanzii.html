<p>Lithops karasmontana subsp.</p>
<p>eberlanzii, commonly known as the Karas Mountains stone plant, is a species of succulent native to the arid regions of Namibia. It is characterized by its compact, basal rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, a feature that helps it blend into its rocky environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens.</p>
