                    <h1>Loranthus lanosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus lanosus, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific ecological requirements, Loranthus lanosus plays a unique role in the ecosystems where it is found.</p>
