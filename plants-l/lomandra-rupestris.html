<p>Lomandra rupestris, commonly known as the rock lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing, mat-like structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland regions. Its leaves are narrow, strap-shaped, and have a tough, fibrous texture.</p>
<p>Lomandra rupestris is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
