                    <h1>Lepidolopsis scopulorum</h1>
<p>Lepidolopsis scopulorum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is typically found on exposed rock surfaces, where it forms a crust-like growth. Its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions makes it an indicator species for environmental stability.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and composition reflect its adaptation to extreme climates and minimal moisture.</p>
