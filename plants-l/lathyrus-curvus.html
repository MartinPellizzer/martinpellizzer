                    <h1>Lathyrus curvus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus curvus, commonly known as the curved vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive curved pods. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>Lathyrus curvus is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
