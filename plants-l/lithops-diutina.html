<p>Lithops diutina, commonly known as the "living stone," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Lithops diutina is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
