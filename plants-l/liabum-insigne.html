<p>Liabum insigne, commonly known as the rare orchid of the genus Liabum, is a delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Liabum insigne is considered a threatened species in its natural range.</p>
