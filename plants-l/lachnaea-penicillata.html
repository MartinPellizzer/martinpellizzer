<p>Lachnaea penicillata, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic algal partner, typically a member of the genus Trebouxia. The thallus of L. penicillata is usually crustose, forming a thin, flat layer on rocks or soil surfaces. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is known for its ability to tolerate environmental stress and is used as an indicator species in ecological studies.</p>
