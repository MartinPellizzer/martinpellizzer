                    <h1>Leptopus decaisnei var. orbicularis</h1>
<p>Leptopus decaisnei var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular leptopus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (rounded) leaves, which are typically a deep green color with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
