                    <h1>Lobaria sibirica</h1>
<p>Lobaria sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian lung lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to blackish thallus with a distinctive, often lobed structure. The lichen forms symbiotic associations with specific cyanobacteria, which contribute to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. It is typically found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
