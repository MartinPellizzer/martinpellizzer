                    <h1>Lactaria sandwicensis</h1>
<p>Lactaria sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian milk cap, is a rare species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is characterized by its unique, sticky, milky fluid that exudes from its cap when damaged. The fungus grows in association with native Hawaiian trees, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. Its cap is typically pale yellow to orange, with a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
