                    <h1>Lycopodium complanatum var. sabinifolium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium complanatum var. sabinifolium, commonly known as the sabinifolium clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that form dense mats, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its sporophytes bear clusters of sporangia, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its distinctive foliage, which resembles the leaves of the sabin tree, hence its common name.</p>
