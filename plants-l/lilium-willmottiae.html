<p>Lilium willmottiae, commonly known as the Willmott's lily, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white flowers with a distinctive red or pink throat. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium willmottiae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
