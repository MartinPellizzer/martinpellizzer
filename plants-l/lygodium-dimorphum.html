<p>Lygodium dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form water fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two different forms—some are simple and others are compound—hence its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and marshes. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Lygodium dimorphum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms.</p>
