                    <h1>Lychnocephalus cipoensis</h1>
<p>Lychnocephalus cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
