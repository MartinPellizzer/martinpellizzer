                    <h1>Lathyrus sylvestris var. intermedius</h1>
<p>Lathyrus sylvestris var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate wood vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trees. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This species is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist meadows, contributing to nitrogen fixation in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia.</p>
