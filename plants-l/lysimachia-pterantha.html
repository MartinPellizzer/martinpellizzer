                    <h1>Lysimachia pterantha</h1>
<p>Lysimachia pterantha, commonly known as the bird's-nest plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of prostrate stems covered with small, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short, erect stalks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Lysimachia pterantha is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and damp meadows, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
