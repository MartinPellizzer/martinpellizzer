<p>Lapsana grandiflora, commonly known as the greater cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive glandular surface, and the flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Lapsana grandiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
