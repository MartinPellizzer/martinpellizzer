                    <h1>Loranthus varians</h1>
<p>Loranthus varians, commonly known as the variable mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus varians plays a role in ecological interactions, influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
