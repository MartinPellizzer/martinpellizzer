                            <h1>Luzula Parviflora Subsp. Divaricata</h1>
<p>Common woodrush, scientifically known as Luzula parviflora subsp. divaricata, is a resilient evergreen plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. This plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Despite its delicate appearance, it is highly adaptable and can survive in poor soil conditions. Its presence often indicates a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem.</p>
