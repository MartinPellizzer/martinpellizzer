<p>Lotus dumetorum, commonly known as the marsh lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows up to 60 cm tall, with upright stems and heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Lotus dumetorum is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
