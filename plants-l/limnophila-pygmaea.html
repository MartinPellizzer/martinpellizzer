<p>Limnophila pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf water nettle, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged. Its small, translucent leaves are arranged in whorls and can be sensitive to touch.</p>
<p>Limnophila pygmaea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
