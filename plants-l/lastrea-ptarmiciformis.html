                    <h1>Lastrea ptarmiciformis</h1>
<p>Lastrea ptarmiciformis, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in spiny, tuberculate structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its stem to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found growing in rocky soils.</p>
