<p>Lepanthes selenitepala subsp.</p>
<p>ackermanii, commonly known as the silver moon orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its pale green to silver-colored flowers, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and broad, providing a striking contrast to its delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
