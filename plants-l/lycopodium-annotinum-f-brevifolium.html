                    <h1>Lycopodium annotinum f. brevifolium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium annotinum f. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are shorter than those of the typical species. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the tips of its stems, a feature typical of many clubmosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This fern ally is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats.</p>
