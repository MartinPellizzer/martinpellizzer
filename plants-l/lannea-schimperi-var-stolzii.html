                    <h1>Lannea schimperi var. stolzii</h1>
<p>Lannea schimperi var. stolzii, commonly known as the African bristlecone, is a rare and woody shrub or small tree native to the dry savannas of eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
