<p>Lepidium bipinnatifidum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as slenderleaf rocket, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the mustard family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it both a weed and a potential indicator of soil conditions.</p>
