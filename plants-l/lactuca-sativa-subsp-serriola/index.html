                            <h1>Lactuca Sativa Subsp. Serriola</h1>
<p>Lactuca sativa subsp. serriola, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is a wild relative of cultivated lettuce that thrives in disturbed soils and open areas. This plant is characterized by its serrated leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia, where it has been a part of the local flora for centuries. Despite its rough texture, prickly lettuce has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its wild nature and adaptability make it an important species in ecological studies and plant genetics.</p>
