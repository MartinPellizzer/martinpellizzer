                            <h1>Lamium Longiflorum Subsp. Numidicum</h1>
<p>Lamium numidicum, scientifically known as Lamium longiflorum subsp. numidicum, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is recognized for its attractive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along garden paths. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing plant. Despite its beauty, it can spread aggressively, requiring careful management in cultivated spaces.</p>
