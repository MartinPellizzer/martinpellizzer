                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. lilacina</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. lilacina, commonly known as the pink twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-lilac flowers, which are smaller and more delicate than the typical white flowers of the species. The plant features small, opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and relies on insect pollination.</p>
<p>This rare form is of interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and limited distribution.</p>
