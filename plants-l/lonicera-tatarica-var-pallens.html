<p>Lonicera tatarica var. pallens, commonly known as the white honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular white flowers in clusters during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed by humans as those of other honeysuckle species.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and floral display.</p>
