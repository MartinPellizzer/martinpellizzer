                    <h1>Loranthus polychroa</h1>
<p>Loranthus polychroa, commonly known as the rainbow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating propagation.</p>
<p>Loranthus polychroa plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various bird and insect species.</p>
