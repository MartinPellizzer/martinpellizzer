<p>Loncomelos prasinantherum, commonly known as the green-flowered liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocks.</p>
<p>Its morphology and reproductive structures make it an important species in the study of early land plant evolution.</p>
