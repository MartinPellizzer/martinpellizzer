                    <h1>Lunathyrium unifurcatum</h1>
<p>Lunathyrium unifurcatum, commonly known as the single-branch moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale purple flowers that open at night, emitting a subtle fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a short, upright stem with few leaves, and its flowers are clustered in a unique, spiral-like arrangement. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
