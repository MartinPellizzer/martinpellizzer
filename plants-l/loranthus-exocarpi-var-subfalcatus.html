                    <h1>Loranthus exocarpi var. subfalcatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus exocarpi var. subfalcatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions like the Philippines and Indonesia. The plant has small, lanceolate leaves and produces small, red berries that are dispersed by birds. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its semi-parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in supporting bird populations, it is an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
