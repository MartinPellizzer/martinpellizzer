<p>Lindsaea alpestris, commonly known as the alpine lindsaea, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. This plant is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Lindsaea alpestris typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats where it can receive ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as spores, are produced on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its unique botanical features.</p>
