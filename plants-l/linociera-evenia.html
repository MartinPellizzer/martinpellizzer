<p>Linociera evenia, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered together. Its berries are dark blue or black and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Linociera evenia is native to parts of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
