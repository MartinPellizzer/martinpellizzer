<p>Lindleyella bicornaria, commonly known as the two-horned lindleyella, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific tropical environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lindeliaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features two prominent horn-like appendages. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in the understory of dense forests. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, adapted to conserve water in its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Lindleyella bicornaria is considered a conservation concern.</p>
