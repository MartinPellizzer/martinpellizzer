<p>Lacistema myricoides var. stipitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lacistema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
