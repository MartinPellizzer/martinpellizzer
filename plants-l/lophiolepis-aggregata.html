<p>Lophiolepis aggregata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, which helps it survive in arid coastal environments.</p>
<p>Lophiolepis aggregata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
