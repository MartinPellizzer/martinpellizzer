                    <h1>Liparis truncicola var. oblanceolata</h1>
<p>Liparis truncicola var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and dense spikes of pale green to white flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in a spiral pattern, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming compact clumps over time.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to other varieties within the Liparis genus.</p>
