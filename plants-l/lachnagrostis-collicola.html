                    <h1>Lachnagrostis collicola</h1>
<p>Lachnagrostis collicola, commonly known as the mountain grass or rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on slopes and cliffs, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is considered an important component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
