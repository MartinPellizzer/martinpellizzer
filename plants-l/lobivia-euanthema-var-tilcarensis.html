                    <h1>Lobivia euanthema var. tilcarensis</h1>
<p>Lobivia euanthema var. tilcarensis, commonly known as the Tilcarensis Lobivia, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded body and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features spiny, ribbed stems that are often covered in a fine, white coating. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
