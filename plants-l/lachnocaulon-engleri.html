<p>Lachnocaulon engleri, commonly known as the Engler's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure, and typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This lichen is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
