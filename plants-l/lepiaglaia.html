                    <h1>Lepiaglaia</h1>
<p>Lepiaglaia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant relies on specific fungal relationships for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its absence of chlorophyll. Its delicate structure makes it highly sensitive to environmental changes, contributing to its endangered status.</p>
<p>Botanists study Lepiaglaia to better understand its unique adaptations and conservation needs.</p>
