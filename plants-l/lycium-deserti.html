                    <h1>Lycium deserti</h1>
<p>Lycium deserti, commonly known as the desert枸杞, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow-orange berries. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that help it access underground water. Its leaves are typically narrow and thick, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The berries are edible and have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
