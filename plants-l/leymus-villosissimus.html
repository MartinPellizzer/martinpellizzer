<p>Leymus villosissimus, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that becomes increasingly hairy with age. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
