<p>Loricaria unduaviensis, commonly known as the Unduaviensis armored catfish, is a species of catfish native to the Amazon River basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bony plates that cover its body, providing protection against predators. The plant-like appearance of its armor has led to its classification within the Loricariidae family. It typically inhabits slow-moving freshwater environments with dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to both aquarists and researchers.</p>
