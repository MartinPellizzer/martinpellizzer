                    <h1>Lecanorchis tabugawaensis</h1>
<p>Lecanorchis tabugawaensis, commonly known as the Tabugawa orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers with a distinctive pink or purple hue.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
