                    <h1>Larix decidua var. sibirica</h1>
<p>Larix decidua var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a variant of the European larch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to cold climates, with needle-like foliage that reduces water loss in harsh environments. Its cones are typically woody and release seeds in the autumn.</p>
<p>This species is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
