                    <h1>Lebretonia</h1>
<p>Lebretonia, commonly known as the "sea holly," is a genus of flowering plants native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, often blue or violet, flower heads that resemble holly berries, surrounded by spiny bracts. Lebretonia species are typically found in sandy or rocky shores, where they thrive in saline and well-drained soils. They have adapted to harsh maritime conditions with their salt-tolerant properties and specialized root systems.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as *Lebretonia maritima* and *Lebretonia humifusa*, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems.</p>
