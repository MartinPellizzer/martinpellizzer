                    <h1>Loranthus scarlatinus</h1>
<p>Loranthus scarlatinus, commonly known as the scarlet mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found on oak and pine trees.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is adapted for a hemiparasitic lifestyle, relying on its host for survival while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
