                    <h1>Leontopodium forrestianum</h1>
<p>Leontopodium forrestianum, commonly known as the snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to low temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its unique appearance, with flower heads surrounded by soft, white bracts, makes it a striking addition to alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its native habitats.</p>
