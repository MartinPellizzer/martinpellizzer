                    <h1>Lysipomia acaulis</h1>
<p>Lysipomia acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage that help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lysipomia acaulis is adapted to cold, sunny conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
