                    <h1>Lithops mundii</h1>
<p>Lithops mundii, commonly known as the "Munro's ice plant," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a pair of fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, which help it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Lithops mundii is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal care once established.</p>
