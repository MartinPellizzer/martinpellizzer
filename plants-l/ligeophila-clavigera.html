<p>Ligeophila clavigera, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that function as traps for tiny aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Ligeophila clavigera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
