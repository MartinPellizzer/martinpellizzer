                    <h1>Lilium michiganense var. uniflorum</h1>
<p>Lilium michiganense var. uniflorum, commonly known as the Michigan lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the Upper Midwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a loose spiral, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing a fragrant flower that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
