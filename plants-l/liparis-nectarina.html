<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like aroma. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often clustering at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The orchid's roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
