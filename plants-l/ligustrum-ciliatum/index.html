                            <h1>Ligustrum Ciliatum</h1>
<p>Ligustrum ciliatum is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is known for its dense foliage and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its adaptability and ornamental value have led to its cultivation in various regions beyond its native habitat. Despite its beauty, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
