                    <h1>Lycopodium ovalifolium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant produces sporophytes that are often clustered at the base, with spore-bearing structures called strobila. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by wind, which is typical for many clubmoss species.</p>
<p>Lycopodium ovalifolium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
