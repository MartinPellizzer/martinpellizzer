                    <h1>Lepidaploa koelzii</h1>
<p>Lepidaploa koelzii, commonly known as the Koelz's lepidaploa, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on alpine flora and plant adaptation.</p>
