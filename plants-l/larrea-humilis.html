                    <h1>Larrea humilis</h1>
<p>Larrea humilis, commonly known as the creosote bush, is a shrub native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and can survive in poor soil conditions due to its deep root system. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Larrea humilis has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes and as a source of aromatic wood.</p>
