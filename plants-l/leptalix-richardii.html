                    <h1>Leptalix richardii</h1>
<p>Leptalix richardii, commonly known as the Richard's lepidocarpu, is a rare and little-known member of the Lepidocarpaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. Native to the humid, shaded understories of tropical and subtropical forests, it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
