                    <h1>Leymus secalinus</h1>
<p>Leymus secalinus, commonly known as red wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. The plant produces spikelets with awns, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Red wheatgrass is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop.</p>
