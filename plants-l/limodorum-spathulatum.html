                    <h1>Limodorum spathulatum</h1>
<p>Limodorum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved lily of the valley, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asparagaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a concern for livestock and pets. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is often balanced by its potential toxicity, making it a plant that requires careful handling.</p>
