                    <h1>Lechea major</h1>
<p>Lechea major, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring smooth, gray-green stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Lechea major plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for the monarch butterfly, which relies on its foliage as a host plant for its larvae.</p>
