<p>Lobelia dressleri, commonly known as the Saddleback Lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Lobelia dressleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions.</p>
