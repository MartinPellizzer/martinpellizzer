<p>Linum corymbiferum subsp.</p>
<p>corymbiferum, commonly known as the clustered flax or yellow flax, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stems and leaves are similar to other members of the Linaceae family, but it is distinguished by its dense inflorescences.</p>
