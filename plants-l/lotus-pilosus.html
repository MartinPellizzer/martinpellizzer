                    <h1>Lotus pilosus</h1>
<p>Lotus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss and provide stability. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats in still water bodies.</p>
<p>Lotus pilosus is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics.</p>
