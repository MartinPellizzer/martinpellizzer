<p>Lapeirousia uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in wet, boggy environments and has adapted to nutrient-poor soils through its mycorrhizal associations. Its leaves are grass-like and form a rosette, while its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several flowers.</p>
<p>Lapeirousia uliginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators.</p>
