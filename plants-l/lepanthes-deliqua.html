                    <h1>Lepanthes deliqua</h1>
<p>Lepanthes deliqua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, Lepanthes deliqua is considered a conservation concern.</p>
