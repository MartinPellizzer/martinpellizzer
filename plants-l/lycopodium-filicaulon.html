<p>Lycopodium filicaulon, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense clusters of scale-like leaves that form a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Lycopodium filicaulon is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult habitats.</p>
