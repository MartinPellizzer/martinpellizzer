                    <h1>Lastrea fragrans</h1>
<p>Lastrea fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its fragrant, showy blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and pleasant aroma.</p>
