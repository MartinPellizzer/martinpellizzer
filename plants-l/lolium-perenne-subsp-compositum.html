<p>Lolium perenne subsp.</p>
<p>compositum, commonly known as Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Timothy grass is valued for forage and has also been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
