<p>Linnaea borealis f. jockmockiensis, commonly known as the Jockmockien bog rose.</p>
<p>This rare variant of the twinflower is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers and trailing stems that often grow along the forest floor. It is native to specific, moist, acidic habitats in the boreal regions of North America. The plant exhibits unique morphological traits, including a more compact growth form and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
