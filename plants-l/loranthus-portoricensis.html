                    <h1>Loranthus portoricensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to the food web and providing shelter for small animals.</p>
