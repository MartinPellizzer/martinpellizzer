                    <h1>Lastrea scariosa</h1>
<p>Lastrea scariosa, commonly known as the rock pear, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, which are often followed by pear-shaped fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Lastrea scariosa is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is well adapted to full sun and minimal rainfall.</p>
