                    <h1>Lobivia oreopogon</h1>
<p>Lobivia oreopogon, commonly known as the rock lobivia, is a species of cactus native to South America, specifically Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines, which help protect it from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green and blue-gray foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is an excellent plant for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardening.</p>
