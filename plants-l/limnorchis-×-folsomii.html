<p>Limnorchis × folsomii, commonly known as the hybrid water lily, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Limnorchis fluitans* and *Limnorchis sanguinea*.</p>
<p>It is a perennial aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, muddy substrates. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often heart-shaped or rounded, with a waxy surface to repel water. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Limnorchis × folsomii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
