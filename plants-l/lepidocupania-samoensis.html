<p>Lepidocupania samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan ironwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has small, pale green leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique adaptations to the tropical climate of its native region.</p>
