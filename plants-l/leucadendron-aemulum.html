<p>Leucadendron aemulum, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking South African shrub or small tree characterized by its silvery-white, papery foliage.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. The plant features rounded, dense clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance.</p>
<p>Leucadendron aemulum is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
