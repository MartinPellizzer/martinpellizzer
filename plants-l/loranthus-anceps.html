                    <h1>Loranthus anceps</h1>
<p>Loranthus anceps, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus anceps is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
