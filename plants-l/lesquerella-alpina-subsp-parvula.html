<p>Lesquerella alpina subsp.</p>
<p>parvula, commonly known as the alpine lesquerella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces seeds encased in a unique, waxy coating that aids in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
