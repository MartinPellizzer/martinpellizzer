<p>Lycoseris denticulata, commonly known as the toothed lycoperd, is a species of fungus in the family Lycoperdaceae.</p>
<p>It is a saprophytic fungus that decomposes organic matter, playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. The fruiting bodies of Lycoseris denticulata are small, with a distinctive toothed or scalloped cap. It is typically found in damp, shaded areas, often associated with decaying wood or leaf litter.</p>
<p>This fungus is not considered edible and is more of a decomposer than a parasite.</p>
