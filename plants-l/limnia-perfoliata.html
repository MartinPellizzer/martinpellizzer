<p>Limnia perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate water-mint, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that often appear to be pierced by the stems of other plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in streams, ponds, and wetlands. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Limnia perfoliata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its oxygenating effects.</p>
