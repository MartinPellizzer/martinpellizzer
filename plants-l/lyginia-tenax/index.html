                            <h1>Lyginia Tenax</h1>
<p>Lyginia tenax, also known as the narrowleaf water smartweed, is a hardy aquatic plant commonly found in wetlands and shallow water habitats. It thrives in temperate regions and is known for its ability to tolerate both standing and flowing water. This plant features slender, grass-like leaves and small pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering pollutants. Lyginia tenax plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is a valuable species for wetland restoration projects.</p>
