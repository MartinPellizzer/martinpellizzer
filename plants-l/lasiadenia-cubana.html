<p>Lasiadenia cubana, commonly known as the Cuban star orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
