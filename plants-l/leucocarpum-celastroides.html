<p>Leucocarpum celastroides, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological interactions and limited distribution.</p>
