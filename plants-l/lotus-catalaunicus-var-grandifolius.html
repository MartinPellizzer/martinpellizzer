<p>Lotus catalaunicus var. grandifolius, commonly known as the Catalan lotus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn.</p>
