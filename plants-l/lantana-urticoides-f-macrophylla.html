<p>Lantana urticoides f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact shrub form, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a reddish or purple throat. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats.</p>
