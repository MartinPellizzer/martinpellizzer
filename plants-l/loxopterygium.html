                    <h1>Loxopterygium</h1>
<p>Loxopterygium, commonly known as the spurge or milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Loxopterygium species are typically shrubs or herbs with simple, alternate leaves and showy, cyathium-like inflorescences. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in dry, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Some species are used in traditional medicine, though caution is required due to their toxic properties.</p>
