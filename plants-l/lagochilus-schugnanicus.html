The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine pubescence, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
