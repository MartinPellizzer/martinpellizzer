                    <h1>Loranthus wyliei</h1>
<p>Loranthus wyliei, commonly known as the Wylie's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus wyliei plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing host tree health and supporting local wildlife.</p>
