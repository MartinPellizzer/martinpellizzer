<p>Limonium hibericum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in salty or brackish environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Limonium hibericum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and ability to tolerate coastal conditions.</p>
