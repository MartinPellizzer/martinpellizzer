                    <h1>Lepanthes velata</h1>
<p>Lepanthes velata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white or pale green flowers that often appear in clusters. Lepanthes velata has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
