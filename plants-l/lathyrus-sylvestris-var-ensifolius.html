                    <h1>Lathyrus sylvestris var. ensifolius</h1>
<p>Lathyrus sylvestris var. ensifolius, commonly known as the woodland vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, climbing stems that often twine around other vegetation, and its leaves are pinnately compound with slender, linear leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland and shaded environments.</p>
