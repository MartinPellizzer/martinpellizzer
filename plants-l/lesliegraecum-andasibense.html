<p>Lesliegraecum andasibense, commonly known as the Andasibe cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, a feature typical of cycads, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
