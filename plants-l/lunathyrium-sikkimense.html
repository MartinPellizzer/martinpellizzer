<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnate fronds that resemble a moon's shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
