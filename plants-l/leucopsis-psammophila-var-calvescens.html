                    <h1>Leucopsis psammophila var. calvescens</h1>
<p>Leucopsis psammophila var. calvescens, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to harsh, sandy environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandy soils, demonstrating strong resilience to drought and salinity.</p>
