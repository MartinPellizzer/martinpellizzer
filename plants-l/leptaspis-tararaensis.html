<p>Leptaspis tararaensis, commonly known as the Tarara leafhopper, is a small, winged insect belonging to the family Cicadellidae.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its slender body and elongated wings. The plant it feeds on is primarily the tarara tree, which is a type of mistletoe. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a host-specific herbivore, influencing the ecology of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and specific host plant, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
