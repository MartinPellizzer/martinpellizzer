                            <h1>Limnanthes Douglasii Subsp. Sulphurea</h1>
<p>Sulphur poppy, scientifically known as Limnanthes douglasii subsp. sulphurea, is a striking annual wildflower native to the western coast of North America. It is renowned for its vibrant yellow-orange blooms that resemble small suns, often appearing in late spring and early summer. This plant thrives in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and stream banks, where it plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike. Despite its beauty, the sulphur poppy faces threats from habitat loss and invasive species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
