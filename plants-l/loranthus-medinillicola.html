                    <h1>Loranthus medinillicola</h1>
<p>Loranthus medinillicola, commonly known as the Mediterranean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in ecological interactions, supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
