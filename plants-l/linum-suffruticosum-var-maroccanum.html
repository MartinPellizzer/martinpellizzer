                    <h1>Linum suffruticosum var. maroccanum</h1>
<p>Linum suffruticosum var. maroccanum, commonly known as the Moroccan flax, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its fibrous stems and leaves are similar to those of common flax, though it is less cultivated for fiber production.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
