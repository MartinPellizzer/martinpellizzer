                    <h1>Lathraea phelypea</h1>
<p>Lathraea phelypea, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It derives its nutrients from the roots of other plants, typically growing in association with grasses and shrubs. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil. It produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, it plays a specialized ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
