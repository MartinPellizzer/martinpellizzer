                    <h1>Limonium coombense</h1>
<p>Limonium coombense, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty coastal environments. Its fibrous roots and drought-resistant nature make it well-suited for harsh, maritime climates.</p>
<p>Limonium coombense is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
