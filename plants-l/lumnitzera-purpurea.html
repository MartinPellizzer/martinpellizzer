                    <h1>Lumnitzera purpurea</h1>
<p>Lumnitzera purpurea, commonly known as the purple mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline environments, such as tidal mudflats and mangrove swamps, due to its specialized adaptations to salt tolerance. The plant has aerial roots that help in gas exchange and provide structural support. Its small, dark purple flowers are followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain buoyant seeds for dispersal.</p>
<p>Lumnitzera purpurea plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
