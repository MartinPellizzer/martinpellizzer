<p>Lannea rubra var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated African leatherleaf, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.
