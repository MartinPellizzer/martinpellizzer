                    <h1>Loranthus oxyphyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus oxyphyllus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which contain toxic compounds, are consumed by birds that spread its seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing host tree health and providing food for specific wildlife.</p>
