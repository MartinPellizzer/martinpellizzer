                    <h1>Lingnania funghomii</h1>
<p>Lingnania funghomii, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the temperate rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the appearance of ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are typically found at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lingnania funghomii is considered an endangered species.</p>
