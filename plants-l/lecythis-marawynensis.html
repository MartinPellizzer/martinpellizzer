<p>Lecythis marawynensis, commonly known as the Amazonian starfruit, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The tree produces a thick, creamy latex that is used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its fruit, which resembles a starfruit, contains a sweet, edible pulp surrounded by a hard, woody shell.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>
