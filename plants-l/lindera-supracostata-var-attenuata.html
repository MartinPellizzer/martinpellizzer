The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
