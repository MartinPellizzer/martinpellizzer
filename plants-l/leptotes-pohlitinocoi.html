The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas, thriving in well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, elongated spur.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
