                    <h1>Lophiolepis czerkessica</h1>
<p>Lophiolepis czerkessica, commonly known as the Caucasian lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to its substrate. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of green algae, which contributes to its photosynthetic capabilities. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or tree bark.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
