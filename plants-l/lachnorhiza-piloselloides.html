                    <h1>Lachnorhiza piloselloides</h1>
<p>Lachnorhiza piloselloides, commonly known as the sticky lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks, soil, or tree bark in temperate climates, forming a crust-like structure that adheres tightly to its substrate. The plant's thallus is usually dark green to blackish in color, with a sticky surface that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
