                    <h1>Lophophora viridescens</h1>
<p>Lophophora viridescens, commonly known as peyote, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in North America.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem that often branches into multiple ribbed stems, which are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Its most notable characteristic is the presence of the psychoactive compound mescaline in its alkaloid-rich cactus buttons.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological and cultural significance, it is protected in many regions and is classified as an endangered species.</p>
