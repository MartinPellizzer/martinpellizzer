                    <h1>Lathraea amentacea</h1>
<p>Lathraea amentacea, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitat.</p>
