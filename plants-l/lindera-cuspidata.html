<p>Lindera cuspidata, commonly known as spicebush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its aromatic leaves and twigs release a spicy scent when crushed, which is the source of its common name.</p>
<p>Lindera cuspidata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
