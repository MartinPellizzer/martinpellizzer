                    <h1>Lyperia tortuosa</h1>
<p>Lyperia tortuosa, commonly known as the spiral lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in early spring. Lyperia tortuosa is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
