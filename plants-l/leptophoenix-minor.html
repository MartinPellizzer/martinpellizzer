<p>Leptophoenix minor, commonly known as the dwarf fan palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact size, typically reaching only about 2 meters in height, and its distinctive fan-shaped leaves that are light green and slightly serrated.

Leptophoenix minor thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
