<p>Leptochloa fusca subsp.</p>
<p>muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing sandy landscapes.</p>
