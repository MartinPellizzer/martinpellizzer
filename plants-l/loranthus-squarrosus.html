                    <h1>Loranthus squarrosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus squarrosus, commonly known as the squarrosus mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and ecological role make it an interesting subject in the study of plant-host interactions.</p>
