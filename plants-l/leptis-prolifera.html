                    <h1>Leptis prolifera</h1>
<p>Leptis prolifera, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It has a succulent, branched stem that often lies close to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Leptis prolifera is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in harsh environments.</p>
