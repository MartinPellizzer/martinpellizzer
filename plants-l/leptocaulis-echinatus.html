                    <h1>Leptocaulis echinatus</h1>
<p>Leptocaulis echinatus, commonly known as the spiny leathery plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to absorb water efficiently from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens and rockeries.</p>
