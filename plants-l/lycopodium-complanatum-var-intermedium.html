                    <h1>Lycopodium complanatum var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium complanatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on forest floors, with slender, wiry stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soils.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other lycopod species and plays a role in maintaining forest floor ecosystems.</p>
