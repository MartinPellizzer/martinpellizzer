                    <h1>Loranthus melanostenon</h1>
<p>Loranthus melanostenon, commonly known as the black-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, including South Africa, where it typically grows on acacia and other woody species. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are dark red or black, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
