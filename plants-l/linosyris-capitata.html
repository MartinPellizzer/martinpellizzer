                    <h1>Linosyris capitata</h1>
<p>Linosyris capitata, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Linosyris capitata is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for pollinators in its native range.</p>
