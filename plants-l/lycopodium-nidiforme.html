                    <h1>Lycopodium nidiforme</h1>
<p>Lycopodium nidiforme, commonly known as the nest clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit, with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, that contain the spores necessary for reproduction. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
