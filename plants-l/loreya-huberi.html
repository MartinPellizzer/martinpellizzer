<p>Loreya huberi, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Loreya huberi is adapted to survive in extreme heat and drought, storing water in its bulbous underground stem.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in desert flora.</p>
