                    <h1>Liponeurum alpinum</h1>
<p>Liponeurum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine liponeurum, is a rare and specialized fern found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are adapted to cold and moist conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in alpine regions, where it thrives in shaded, humid microhabitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Liponeurum alpinum is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats.</p>
