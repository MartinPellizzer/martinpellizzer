                    <h1>Loranthus poggei</h1>
<p>Loranthus poggei, commonly known as the Pogge's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus poggei is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
