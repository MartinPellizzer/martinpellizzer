                    <h1>Lycopodium pruinosum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium pruinosum, commonly known as the velvet clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. L. pruinosum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
