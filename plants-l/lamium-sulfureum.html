                    <h1>Lamium sulfureum</h1>
<p>Lamium sulfureum, commonly known as yellow dead nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are square in cross-section, a characteristic common among plants in the mint family.</p>
<p>Lamium sulfureum is often found in woodland areas, along paths, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
