                    <h1>Lonicera multiflora</h1>
<p>Lonicera multiflora, commonly known as Japanese honeysuckle, is a vigorous climbing vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can be invasive in non-native regions. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its berries provide food for birds.</p>
<p>The plant has been introduced to many parts of the world, often as an ornamental, but it can become a problematic weed in natural habitats.</p>
