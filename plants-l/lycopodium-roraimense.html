                    <h1>Lycopodium roraimense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths. Native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil, this plant thrives in the unique, nutrient-poor soils of these high-altitude plateaus. Its spore-producing structures, called strobili, are clustered at the tips of its branches, aiding in its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and fragile ecosystem, Lycopodium roraimense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
