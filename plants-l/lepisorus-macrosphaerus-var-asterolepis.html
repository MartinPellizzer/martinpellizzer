                    <h1>Lepisorus macrosphaerus var. asterolepis</h1>
<p>Lepisorus macrosphaerus var. asterolepis, commonly known as the star-leaf polypody, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often star-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
