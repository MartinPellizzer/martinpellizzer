                    <h1>Liparis deistelii</h1>
<p>Liparis deistelii, commonly known as the Deistel's orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its small size and specific habitat requirements make it particularly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
