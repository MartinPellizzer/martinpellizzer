                    <h1>Lecythis brancoensis</h1>
<p>Lecythis brancoensis, commonly known as the Branco rubber tree, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and striking yellow flowers. The plant produces a latex sap that has been historically used for rubber production, though its commercial use has declined. Its fruit is a thick-shelled, spiky capsule that contains edible seeds, which are sometimes consumed by local communities.</p>
<p>The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
