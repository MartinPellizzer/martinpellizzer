                    <h1>Leymus secalinus var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Leymus secalinus var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, pubescent leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing颖果, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and nutritional value, it is sometimes used in forage agriculture and ecological restoration projects.</p>
