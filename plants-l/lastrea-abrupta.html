<p>Lastrea abrupta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved rock fig, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
