                    <h1>Luvunga monophylla</h1>
<p>Luvunga monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its solitary, large, fan-shaped leaf that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces a tall, unbranched stem that bears a single, large, spherical cone at the top. Luvunga monophylla is a dioecious species, meaning it has separate male and female plants.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
