                <h1>Lycopodioides jenmanii</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, herbaceous stems that bear microphylls, which are simple leaves without veins. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered in cones. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Lycopodioides jenmanii is a relic of an ancient lineage, reflecting the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
