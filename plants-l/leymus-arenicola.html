                    <h1>Leymus arenicola</h1>
<p>Leymus arenicola, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has fine, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy habitats.</p>
