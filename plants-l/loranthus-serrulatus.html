                    <h1>Loranthus serrulatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalypts and acacias.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its presence can sometimes weaken the host tree, affecting its growth and health.</p>
