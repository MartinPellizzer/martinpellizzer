<p>Loxocarpus stapfii, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and yellowish-orange flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as pines and podocarps, using a specialized root system called a haustellum. It produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
