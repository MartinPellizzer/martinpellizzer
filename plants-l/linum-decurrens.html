<p>Linum decurrens, commonly known as creeping flax, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Linum decurrens is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional medicine.</p>
