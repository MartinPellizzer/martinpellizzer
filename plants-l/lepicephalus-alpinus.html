                    <h1>Lepicephalus alpinus</h1>
<p>Lepicephalus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine lepicephalus, is a rare and elusive plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the short growing season in alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
