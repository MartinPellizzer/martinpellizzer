                            <h1>Leontodon Taraxacum Subsp. Palustris</h1>
<p>Marsh dandelion, scientifically known as Leontodon taraxacum subsp. palustris, is a hardy perennial plant that thrives in wetland environments. It is commonly found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant is characterized by its delicate yellow flowers and basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. Its ability to flourish in moist soils makes it an important component of aquatic and wetland ecosystems. Despite its common name, the marsh dandelion is distinct from the typical dandelion and plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
