                    <h1>Lanessania turbinata</h1>
<p>Lanessania turbinata, commonly known as the turban lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, turban-shaped thallus that is typically bright yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to lichenologists and environmental scientists.</p>
