<p>Lycopodium bryophyllum, commonly known as the "liverwort plant," is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Ptycherellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. This plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. Lycopodium bryophyllum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
