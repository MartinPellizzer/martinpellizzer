                    <h1>Loranthus cuneatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus cuneatus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ecological role in supporting bird species that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategy make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
