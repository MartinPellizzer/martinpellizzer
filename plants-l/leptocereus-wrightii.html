<p>Leptocereus wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's night-blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, covered in spines and bearing clusters of white flowers that open at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats.</p>
<p>The cactus is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades.</p>
