<p>Lolium marschallii, commonly known as marsh grass or marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, meadows, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Lolium marschallii plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
