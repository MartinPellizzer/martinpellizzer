<p>Lucuma batten-poollii, commonly known as the golden fruit tree, is a rare and ancient species native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange fruit, which is rich in nutrients and has a sweet, nutty flavor. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces fruit during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lucuma batten-poollii is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
