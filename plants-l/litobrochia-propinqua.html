                    <h1>Litobrochia propinqua</h1>
<p>Litobrochia propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leafed brochidium, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, cylindrical stems covered in fine, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stem for survival in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Litobrochia propinqua is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
