                    <h1>Lycopodiella eichleri</h1>
<p>Lycopodiella eichleri, commonly known as the Eichler's clubmoss, is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on forest floors. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as along streams or in humid woodlands. Lycopodiella eichleri reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ancient lineage provide insights into the evolutionary history of early vascular plants.</p>
