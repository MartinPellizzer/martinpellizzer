                    <h1>Lavrania cactiformis</h1>
<p>Lavrania cactiformis, commonly known as the spiky leaf cactus, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a shrub-like structure with fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, adapting to its dry environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>
<p>Lavrania cactiformis is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in xerophytic gardens.</p>
