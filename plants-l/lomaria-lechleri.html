                    <h1>Lomaria lechleri</h1>
<p>Lomaria lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree or caucho, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its latex-producing properties, which have been historically used for rubber production. Its roots and bark contain compounds with medicinal properties, used traditionally by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in its natural range.</p>
