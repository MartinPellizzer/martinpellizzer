                    <h1>Laetia coriacea</h1>
<p>Laetia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-laetia, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater during prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Laetia coriacea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
