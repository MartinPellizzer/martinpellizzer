                    <h1>Lepturus fasciculatus</h1>
<p>Lepturus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered lichen, is a crustose lichen that forms a dense, tightly packed growth on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-brown thallus, which is often covered with a fine, powdery layer. This lichen thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found on calcareous substrates. Its morphology includes a well-developed medulla and a thin, continuous cortex.</p>
<p>Lepturus fasciculatus plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
