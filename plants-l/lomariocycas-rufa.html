                    <h1>Lomariocycas rufa</h1>
<p>Lomariocycas rufa, commonly known as the red cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a vulnerable species, requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Lomariocycas rufa is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
