                    <h1>Leptodactylon caespitosum</h1>
<p>Leptodactylon caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, cushion-like growths on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish-green thallus, which is often covered in short, upright lobes. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a symbiotic partnership between algae and fungi. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its structure provides habitat for various microorganisms and contributes to soil formation in rocky habitats.</p>
