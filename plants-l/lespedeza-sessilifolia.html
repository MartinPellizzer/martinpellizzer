<p>Lespedeza sessilifolia, commonly known as smallleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, oval leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, fields, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Lespedeza sessilifolia is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife.</p>
