<p>Lycomormium minus, commonly known as the small lycomormium, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae, which includes clubmosses and related species. The plant is characterized by its small, slender stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lycomormium minus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
