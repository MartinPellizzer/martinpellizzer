<p>Lissochilus alexandri, commonly known as the Alexander's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often hairy pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a distinctive shape resembling a slipper. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
