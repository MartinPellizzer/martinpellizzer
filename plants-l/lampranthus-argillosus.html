<p>Lampranthus argillosus, commonly known as the clayroot or clay lily, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lampranthus argillosus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
