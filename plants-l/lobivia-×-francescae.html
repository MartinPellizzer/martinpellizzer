                    <h1>Lobivia × francescae</h1>
<p>Lobivia × francescae, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Lobivia tenuis and Lobivia rhombifolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in many cacti of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
