                    <h1>Leucanthemum depressum</h1>
<p>Leucanthemum depressum, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Leucanthemum depressum is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
