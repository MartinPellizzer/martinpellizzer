<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Lastrea elegans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
