<p>Lychnis antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic willow, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in the extreme conditions of the continent's tundra environment. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss in the harsh climate.</p>
<p>Lychnis antarctica plays a vital role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for native invertebrates.</p>
