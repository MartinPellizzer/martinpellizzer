                    <h1>Loranthus bulawayensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus bulawayensis, commonly known as the Bulawayo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to southern Africa, particularly Zimbabwe. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are usually clustered in short inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially damaging.</p>
