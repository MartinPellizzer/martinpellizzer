<p>Lepisorus yamaokae, commonly known as the Yamaoka's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Lepisorus yamaokae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
