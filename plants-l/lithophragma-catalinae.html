                    <h1>Lithophragma catalinae</h1>
<p>Lithophragma catalinae, commonly known as the Catalina rockfoil, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on coastal bluffs and in coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Lithophragma catalinae is adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
