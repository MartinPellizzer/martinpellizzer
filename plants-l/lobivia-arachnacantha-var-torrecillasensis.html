                    <h1>Lobivia arachnacantha var. torrecillasensis</h1>
<p>Lobivia arachnacantha var. torrecillasensis, commonly known as the Torrecillas Lobivia, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular body with ribbed stems that develop a dense covering of white, woolly hairs, providing insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers during the spring, adding a subtle contrast to its rugged appearance. It is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
