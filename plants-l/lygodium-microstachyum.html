                    <h1>Lygodium microstachyum</h1>
<p>Lygodium microstachyum, commonly known as the small-stalked climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds and a unique climbing habit, often using its rhizomes to attach to trees or other structures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically clustered in strobila. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
