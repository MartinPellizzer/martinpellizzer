                    <h1>Loranthus viridiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Sapotaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces greenish-white flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in forested areas.</p>
