<p>Lupinus glabratus, commonly known as the smooth lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of spiny, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has palmately compound leaves with several leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Lupinus glabratus is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve soil fertility.</p>
