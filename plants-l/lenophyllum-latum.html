                    <h1>Lenophyllum latum</h1>
<p>Lenophyllum latum, commonly known as the broad-leafed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, flattened thallus with a pale to dark green or reddish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary photosynthetic function. Its structure includes a complex network of hyphae that anchor it to surfaces like bark or soil.</p>
<p>Lenophyllum latum is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
