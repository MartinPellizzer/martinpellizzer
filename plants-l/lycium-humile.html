<p>Lycium humile, commonly known as the dwarf wolfberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine.

Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it blooms in the spring.</p>
<p>Lycium humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
