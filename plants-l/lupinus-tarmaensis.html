<p>Lupinus tarmaensis, commonly known as the Tarma lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Lupinus tarmaensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity in its native habitat.</p>
