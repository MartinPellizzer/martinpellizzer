<p>Loranthus crassipetalus, commonly known as the thick-petaled mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches to its host tree through haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered white or yellowish flowers. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
