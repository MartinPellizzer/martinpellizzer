                    <h1>Linum broteri</h1>
<p>Linum broteri, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers and linear leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky soils or along riverbanks. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used traditionally for their strong fibers, similar to flax.</p>
<p>Linum broteri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in degraded areas.</p>
