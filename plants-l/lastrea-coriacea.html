                    <h1>Lastrea coriacea</h1>
<p>Lastrea coriacea, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Lastrea coriacea is often cultivated as a low-maintenance ornamental plant.</p>
