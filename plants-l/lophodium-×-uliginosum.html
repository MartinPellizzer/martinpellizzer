                    <h1>Lophodium × uliginosum</h1>
<p>Lophodium × uliginosum, commonly known as the bog lichen, is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and forest floors, where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of a thallus made up of the fungal mycelium and algal cells. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitive nature, it is often used as an indicator of environmental health and air quality.</p>
