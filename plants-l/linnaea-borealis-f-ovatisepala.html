                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. ovatisepala</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. ovatisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with broad, ovate sepals that are often pink or white in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>This form is less common than the typical twinflower and is often found in specific microhabitats where it thrives.</p>
