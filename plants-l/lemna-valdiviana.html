<p>Lemna valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian duckweed, is a small, floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the growth of stolons. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can form dense mats on the water surface, influencing local ecosystems and water quality.</p>
