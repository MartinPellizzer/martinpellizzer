<p>Lithocarpus braianensis, commonly known as the Bornean stoneæ Ž, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, inedible nuts enclosed in a thick, leathery shell, similar to other members of its genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary lowland and hill dipterocarp forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both ecological and botanical research.</p>
