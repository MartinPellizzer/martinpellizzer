<p>Lathraea squamaria subsp.</p>
<p>squamaria, commonly known as the moss-like broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, instead having a root system that attaches to the roots of its host.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in a spike-like structure. It is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited visibility, it is sometimes overlooked in ecological studies.</p>
