                    <h1>Landia astrographa</h1>
<p>Landia astrographa, commonly known as the starlight lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped petals that glow faintly under moonlight, a feature attributed to its high concentration of bioluminescent compounds. The plant's leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It blooms during the summer months, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, Landia astrographa is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
