                    <h1>Loranthus scurrula</h1>
<p>Loranthus scurrula, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaves. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Loranthus scurrula plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and other animals that disperse its seeds.</p>
