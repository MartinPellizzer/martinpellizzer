                    <h1>Leptogramma pilosa var. alabamensis</h1>
<p>Leptogramma pilosa var. alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama leathery fern, is a variant of the leathery fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
