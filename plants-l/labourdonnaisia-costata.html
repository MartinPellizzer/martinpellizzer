                    <h1>Labourdonnaisia costata</h1>
<p>Labourdonnaisia costata, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and it has a robust root system that helps it withstand salty sea air and strong winds.</p>
<p>Labourdonnaisia costata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
