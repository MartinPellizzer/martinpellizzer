<p>Lereschia flahaultii, commonly known as the Flahault's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a distinctive, leaf-like structure. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic partner, a green alga, and a fungal partner, which together form a composite organism. It is often found growing on bark and rock surfaces in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat.</p>
