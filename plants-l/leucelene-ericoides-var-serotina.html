                    <h1>Leucelene ericoides var. serotina</h1>
<p>Leucelene ericoides var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering heath, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its late blooming period, usually in late summer or early fall, distinguishes it from other heath species.</p>
<p>The leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
