<p>Lysimachia hillebrandii var. venosa, commonly known as the variegated yellow archangel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features spreading stems that produce small, lance-shaped leaves with striking variegation of white and green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
