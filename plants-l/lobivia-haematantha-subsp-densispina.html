<p>Lobivia haematantha subsp.</p>
<p>densispina, commonly known as the dense-spined lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
