<p>Lerchia heterocarpa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Lerchia heterocarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
