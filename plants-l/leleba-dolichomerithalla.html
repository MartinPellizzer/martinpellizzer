<p>Leleba dolichomerithalla, commonly known as the long-stemmed leleba, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leleba dolichomerithalla is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
