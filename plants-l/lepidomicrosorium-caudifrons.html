                    <h1>Lepidomicrosorium caudifrons</h1>
<p>Lepidomicrosorium caudifrons, commonly known as the long-headed water clover, is a small aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It has delicate, creeping rhizomes that form dense mats on the pond bottom. The plant produces small, bright green fronds with a distinctive elongated shape and a feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Lepidomicrosorium caudifrons plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
