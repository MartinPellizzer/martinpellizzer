                    <h1>Lobivia saltensis var. schreiteri</h1>
<p>Lobivia saltensis var. schreiteri, commonly known as the Schreiter's Lobivia, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.</p>
<p>It features a globular to cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green to grayish surface that develops a whitish coating over time. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, lateral pedicels. It is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
