                            <h1>Lupinus Martinetianus</h1>
<p>Lupinus martinetianus is a striking member of the legume family known for its vibrant blue and purple flowers. Native to the coastal regions of southern California, this plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the shoreline. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, enriching the soil for other plants. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats and is considered a rare species in its native range.</p>
