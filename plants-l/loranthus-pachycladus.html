                    <h1>Loranthus pachycladus</h1>
<p>Loranthus pachycladus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to a host tree, typically from the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is native to parts of India, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
