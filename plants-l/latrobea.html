                    <h1>Latrobea</h1>
<p>Latrobea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique member of the Proteaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lantern-like blooms that appear in late summer, often in shades of white and pink. The plant is typically low-growing, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly beetles, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Latrobea is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
