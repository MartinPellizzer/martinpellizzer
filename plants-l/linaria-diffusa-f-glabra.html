<p>Linaria diffusa f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth linaria, is a variant of the common toadflax.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and bright yellow flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs, though the 'glabra' form is distinguished by its smoother, hairless surface. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
