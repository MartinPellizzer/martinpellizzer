<p>Loxogramme elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Loxogramme elongata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
