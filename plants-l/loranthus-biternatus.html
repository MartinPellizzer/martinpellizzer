                    <h1>Loranthus biternatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus biternatus, commonly known as the three-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant has small, ovate leaves arranged in whorls of three, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The berries it bears are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
