                    <h1>Lepidesmia</h1>
<p>Lepidesmia, commonly known as the "silverleaf" or "silverbush," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. Lepidesmia species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce small, often showy flowers that are usually pink or white, and they are adapted to grow in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Lepidesmia glaberrima, which is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>
