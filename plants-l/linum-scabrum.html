                    <h1>Linum scabrum</h1>
<p>Linum scabrum, commonly known as rough flax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Linum scabrum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is not widely cultivated for its fibers like traditional flax, but it is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
