                    <h1>Larix × marschlinsii</h1>
<p>Larix × marschlinsii, commonly known as the hybrid larch, is a deciduous conifer that results from the cross between the European larch (Larix decidua) and the Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that release wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its natural range expansion. Its needles are typically bright yellow to golden in color, turning bronze in the fall before shedding, which adds to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Larix × marschlinsii is often planted in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
