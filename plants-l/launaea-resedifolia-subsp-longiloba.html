<p>Launaea resedifolia subsp.</p>
<p>longiloba, commonly known as the long-stemmed desert leaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, and its stems are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to extreme environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
