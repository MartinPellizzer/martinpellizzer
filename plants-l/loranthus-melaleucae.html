                    <h1>Loranthus melaleucae</h1>
<p>Loranthus melaleucae, commonly known as the mistletoe of the melaleuca tree, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for sustenance, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in Australia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, contributing to the ecological dynamics of the forest canopy.</p>
