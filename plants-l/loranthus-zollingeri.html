                    <h1>Loranthus zollingeri</h1>
<p>Loranthus zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
