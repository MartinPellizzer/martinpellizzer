<p>Lysimachia iniki, commonly known as the Kauai mountain chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p>
<p>It typically features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Lysimachia iniki plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects and birds.</p>
