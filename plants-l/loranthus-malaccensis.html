                    <h1>Loranthus malaccensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus malaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the families Myrtaceae and Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds and facilitate dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
