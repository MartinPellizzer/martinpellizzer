                    <h1>Limeum argute-carinatum</h1>
<p>Limeum argute-carinatum, commonly known as the spiny leaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, spiny leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often found in protected habitats and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
