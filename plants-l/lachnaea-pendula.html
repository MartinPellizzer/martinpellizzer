<p>Lachnaea pendula, commonly known as the hanging lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a flat, leaf-like structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in moist, shaded environments. The thallus is usually dark green to blackish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It lacks a distinct cortex and has a simple, branched rhizine system for attachment.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality.</p>
