<p>Limnophila costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, delicate leaves that are often submerged. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
<p>Limnophila costaricensis is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb pollutants from water.</p>
