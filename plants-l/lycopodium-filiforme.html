                    <h1>Lycopodium filiforme</h1>
<p>Lycopodium filiforme, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems that grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium filiforme typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early land plant evolution.</p>
