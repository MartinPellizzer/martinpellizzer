                    <h1>Loranthus farinosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus farinosus, commonly known as the sticky false mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily from the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's stems are woody and branched, with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky, waxy substance. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
