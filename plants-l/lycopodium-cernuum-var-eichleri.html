                    <h1>Lycopodium cernuum var. eichleri</h1>
<p>Lycopodium cernuum var. eichleri, commonly known as the Eichleri's clubmoss, is a variant of the common ground-pine.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a mat on the forest floor. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, typical of the Lycopodiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of understory plant communities in certain ecosystems.</p>
