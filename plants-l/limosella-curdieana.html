<p>Limosella curdieana, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, thriving in coastal dunes and salt marshes. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Limosella curdieana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
