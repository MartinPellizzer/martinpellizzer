<p>Lathyrus lanszwertii subsp.</p>
<p>aridus, commonly known as the desert pea, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers, typically ranging in color from pink to purple, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. Its leaves are compound and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
