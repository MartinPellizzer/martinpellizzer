<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often floating on the water's surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in shallow waters while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
