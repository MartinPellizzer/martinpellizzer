                <h1>Leptoglottis floridana</h1>
<p>Leptoglottis floridana, commonly known as the Florida leathery fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the wetlands of Florida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, broad, lance-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
