<p>Lepisorus tosaensis f. bifidus, commonly known as the Tosa spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its unique feature is the bifid (split) shape of its sporangia, which distinguishes it from other members of the genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
