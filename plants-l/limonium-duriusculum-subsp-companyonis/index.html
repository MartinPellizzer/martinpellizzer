                            <h1>Limonium Duriusculum Subsp. Companyonis</h1>
<p>Limonium duriusculum subsp. companyonis is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It thrives in sandy and calcareous soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores where it withstands harsh environmental conditions. The plant is known for its delicate, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Despite its beauty, this subspecies faces threats from habitat loss and climate change, highlighting the need for continued research and protection.</p>
