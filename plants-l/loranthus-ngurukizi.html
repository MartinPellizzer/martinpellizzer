                    <h1>Loranthus ngurukizi</h1>
<p>Loranthus ngurukizi, commonly known as the Ngurukizi mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the forests of East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis to some extent. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by berries that contain the seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive in shaded environments where competition for light is intense.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and unique adaptations.</p>
