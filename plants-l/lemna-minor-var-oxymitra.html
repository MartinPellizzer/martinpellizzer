<p>Lemna minor var. oxymitra, commonly known as water velvet, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Araceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, often appearing in clusters on the water's surface. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water bodies. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to absorb nutrients and heavy metals from the water.</p>
