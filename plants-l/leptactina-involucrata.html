                    <h1>Leptactina involucrata</h1>
<p>Leptactina involucrata, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent, showy ray florets, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered an important species in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
