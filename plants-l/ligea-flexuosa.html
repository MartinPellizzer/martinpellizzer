<p>Ligea flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping ligea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground in a mat-like formation. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Ligea flexuosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks.</p>
