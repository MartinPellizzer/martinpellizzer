                    <h1>Loranthus lobeliiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus lobeliiflorus, commonly known as the Florida mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in ecological interactions, supporting bird populations and influencing the health of its host trees.</p>
