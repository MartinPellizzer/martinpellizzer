<p>Lennea brunnescens var. novogalicensis, commonly known as the Galician brown lennea, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of Galicia, Spain.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a distinctive brownish bark, and its small, elliptical leaves that are pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
