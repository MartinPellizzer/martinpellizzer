                    <h1>Lycopodioides firmula</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides firmula, commonly known as the firmula clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Lycopodioides firmula thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ancient lineage make it a valuable indicator of undisturbed, ecologically rich habitats.</p>
