<p>Limnosipanea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water lily, is a water plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to repel water.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly beetles, which are attracted to the plant's scent and nectar.</p>
