                    <h1>Lepisanthes deficiens</h1>
<p>Lepisanthes deficiens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring a slender stem and a single, pale green or white flower. The plant lacks a visible root system and relies on symbiotic relationships with specific fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Lepisanthes deficiens is considered critically endangered.</p>
