                    <h1>Lactuca stanekii</h1>
<p>Lactuca stanekii, commonly known as the Stanek's lettuce, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by cylindrical, ribbed achenes. Lactuca stanekii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from other lettuce species, though it shares some morphological similarities with cultivated lettuce varieties.</p>
