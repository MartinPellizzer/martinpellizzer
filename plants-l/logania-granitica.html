<p>Logania granitica, commonly known as the granite logania, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often on granite outcrops. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Logania granitica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
