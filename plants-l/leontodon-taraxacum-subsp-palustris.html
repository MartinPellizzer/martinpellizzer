<p>Leontodon taraxacum subsp.</p>
<p>palustris, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that bears a single yellow composite flower head.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers develop into fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth form and longer flowering stems compared to other dandelion species.</p>
