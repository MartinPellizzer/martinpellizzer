                    <h1>Loranthus cycnei-sinus</h1>
<p>Loranthus cycnei-sinus, commonly known as the Sinus cycnei Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that aid in photosynthesis. Its flowers are small and usually clustered, with both male and female reproductive structures present on the same inflorescence.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, facilitating its dispersal by animals.</p>
