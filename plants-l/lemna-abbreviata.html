<p>Lemna abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf water shield, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length, with a waxy surface that helps it float. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
