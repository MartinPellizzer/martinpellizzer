                    <h1>Leymus littoralis</h1>
<p>Leymus littoralis, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Leymus littoralis plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
