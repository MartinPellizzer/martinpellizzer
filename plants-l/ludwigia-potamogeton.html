<p>Ludwigia potamogeton, commonly known as water thyme, is a floating aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green, often with a reddish or purple tint depending on light conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom in late summer. It spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species.</p>
<p>Ludwigia potamogeton plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
