                    <h1>Lycopodium trachyloma</h1>
<p>Lycopodium trachyloma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Native to regions of southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
