                            <h1>Launaea Pulchra</h1>
<p>Launaea pulchra is a striking succulent native to southern Africa, known for its unique, spiky appearance and vibrant green color. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive long periods without rain. Launaea pulchra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its eye-catching foliage and resilience. Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its sharp spines and toxic sap.</p>
