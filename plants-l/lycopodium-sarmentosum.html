                    <h1>Lycopodium sarmentosum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium sarmentosum, commonly known as the running clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, club-shaped sporophylls that bear spores, which are dispersed by wind. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution.</p>
