<p>Lycopodium × oellgaardii is a rare and intriguing species of clubmoss native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. This plant is known for its unique morphology and ecological significance within its habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it plays a vital role in soil stabilization. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes. Understanding and conserving Lycopodium × oellgaardii is essential for preserving biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
