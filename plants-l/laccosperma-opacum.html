<p>Laccosperma opacum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Laccosperma opacum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
