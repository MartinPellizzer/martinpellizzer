                    <h1>Loranthus exocarpi var. venulosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus exocarpi var. venulosus, commonly known as the veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a distinctive venation pattern that gives it its scientific name.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of its host trees.</p>
