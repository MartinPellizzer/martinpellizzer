                    <h1>Lygodesmia exigua</h1>
<p>Lygodesmia exigua, commonly known as the small green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found in shaded, humid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic nature and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
