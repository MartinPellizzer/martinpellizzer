<p>Lycopodiella subappressa, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lycopodiella subappressa is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for small organisms.</p>
