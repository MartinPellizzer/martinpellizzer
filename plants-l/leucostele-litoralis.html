                    <h1>Leucostele litoralis</h1>
<p>Leucostele litoralis, commonly known as the coastal leucostele, is a species of flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Leucostele litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for specialized invertebrates.</p>
