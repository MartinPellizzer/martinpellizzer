                    <h1>Lepisorus marginatus</h1>
<p>Lepisorus marginatus, commonly known as the marginate rock fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive marginal vein that runs along the edges of the leaflets. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky or wooded slopes in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
