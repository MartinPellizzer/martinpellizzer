                    <h1>Lathyrus helodes</h1>
<p>Lathyrus helodes, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive shape. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
