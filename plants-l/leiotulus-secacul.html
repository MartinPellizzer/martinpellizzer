                    <h1>Leiotulus secacul</h1>
<p>Leiotulus secacul, commonly known as the slender bladdergrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils effectively.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
