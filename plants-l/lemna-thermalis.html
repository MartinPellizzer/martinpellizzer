                    <h1>Lemna thermalis</h1>
<p>Lemna thermalis, commonly known as the thermal water lettuce, is a small, floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae) and is characterized by its tiny, rosette-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its high growth rate, it can be both a useful indicator of water quality and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
