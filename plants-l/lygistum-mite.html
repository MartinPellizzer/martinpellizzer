                    <h1>Lygistum mite</h1>
<p>Lygistum mite, commonly known as the red spider mite, is a tiny arachnid belonging to the family Tetranychidae.</p>
<p>It is a significant pest in agricultural and horticultural settings, feeding on the sap of plants and causing damage to leaves. The mite thrives in warm, dry conditions and can rapidly infest crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and ornamental plants. Its life cycle includes several stages, from egg to adult, with females laying hundreds of eggs on the undersides of leaves.</p>
<p>Botanically, it affects plant physiology by reducing photosynthetic efficiency and weakening overall plant health.</p>
