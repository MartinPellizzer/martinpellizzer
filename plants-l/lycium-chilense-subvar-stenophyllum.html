<p>Lycium chilense subvar. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrowleaf wolfberry, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in coastal areas and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The berries are edible and have been used traditionally for their nutritional and medicinal properties.</p>
