                    <h1>Lemna pleiorrhiza</h1>
<p>Lemna pleiorrhiza, commonly known as the greater duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It has flat, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, and it lacks true roots, instead having root-like structures called rhizoids. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of its fronds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems.</p>
