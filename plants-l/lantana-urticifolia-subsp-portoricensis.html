<p>Lantana urticifolia subsp.</p>
<p>portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican lantana, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom throughout the year. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
