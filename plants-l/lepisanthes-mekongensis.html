<p>Lepisanthes mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids. Its botanical features include a slender, wiry stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
