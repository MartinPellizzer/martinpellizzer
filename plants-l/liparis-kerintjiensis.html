                    <h1>Liparis kerintjiensis</h1>
<p>Liparis kerintjiensis, commonly known as the Kerintji orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, rhizomatous growth habit and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, featuring three sepals, three petals, and a specialized lip used in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
