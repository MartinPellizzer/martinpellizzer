                    <h1>Leptoloma syrticola</h1>
<p>Leptoloma syrticola, commonly known as the desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rock surfaces or soil in regions with low humidity. The plant's structure is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture and protect against extreme temperatures. Its photosynthetic partner, the alga, provides energy through sunlight, while the fungus offers structural support and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows Leptoloma syrticola to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions where most plants cannot.</p>
