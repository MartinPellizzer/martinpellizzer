<p>Lycopodium inundatum f. funiforme, commonly known as the floating clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss plant characterized by its unique growth habit.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant features small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats on the surface of water or moist soil. It thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant's rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called sporophylls, produce spores that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
