                    <h1>Luxemburgia major</h1>
<p>Luxemburgia major, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, crust-like thallus that can grow up to several centimeters in diameter. The plant consists of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
