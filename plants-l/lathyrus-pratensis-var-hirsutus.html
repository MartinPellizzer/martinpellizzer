                    <h1>Lathyrus pratensis var. hirsutus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus pratensis var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Lathyrus pratensis var. hirsutus is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
