<p>Limnochloa parvula, commonly known as the small-leaf watergrass, is a small aquatic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in late summer. Limnochloa parvula plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the freshwater ecosystems in its native range.</p>
