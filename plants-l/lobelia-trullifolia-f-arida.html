<p>Lobelia trullifolia f. arida, commonly known as the arid lobelia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens in arid climates.</p>
