<p>Lepidosperma, commonly known as the spike rush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wet or marshy environments, often in temperate regions. They are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Lepidosperma species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are important components of wetland ecosystems.</p>
