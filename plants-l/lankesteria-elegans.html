                    <h1>Lankesteria elegans</h1>
<p>Lankesteria elegans, commonly known as the velvet tunicate plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and striking, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating that gives it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance.</p>
<p>Lankesteria elegans is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add a tropical touch to indoor gardens.</p>
