                            <h1>Lastrea Calcarata Var. Ciliata</h1>
<p>Coralroot orchid, scientifically known as Lastrea calcarata var. ciliata, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in the understory of temperate forests. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrients, making it a unique example of mycoheterotrophy. Its delicate, coral-like roots give it its name, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are often overlooked despite their ecological importance. This orchid thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in the eastern United States. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
