                    <h1>Leucojum hernandezii</h1>
<p>Leucojum hernandezii, commonly known as the Hernandez's white squill, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Spain, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette near the ground.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
