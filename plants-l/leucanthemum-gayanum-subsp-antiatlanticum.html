<p>Leucanthemum gayanum subsp.</p>
<p>antiatlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic leucanthemum, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white ray florets and dark brown central disk florets, which give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along cliffs and rocky shores, thriving in coastal environments. It is a perennial herb that produces small, daisy-like flowers from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
