<p>Loxogramme cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize shallow water bodies.</p>
<p>Loxogramme cuspidata plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
