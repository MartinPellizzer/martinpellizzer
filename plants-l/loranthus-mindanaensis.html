<p>Loranthus mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It grows on various host trees, primarily in the Philippines, and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
