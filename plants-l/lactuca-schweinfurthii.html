<p>Lactuca schweinfurthii, commonly known as the desert lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Lactuca schweinfurthii is often found in sandy soils and is considered an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
