<p>Lycopodium clavatum var. nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Lycopodium clavatum.</p>
