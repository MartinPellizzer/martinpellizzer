<p>Linum usitatissimum var. flavescens, commonly known as yellow flax, is a variant of the common flax plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple hues of the standard flax species. The plant produces slender, fibrous stalks that are used in textile production, similar to its parent species. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This variety is also cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in dye-making and medicinal applications.</p>
