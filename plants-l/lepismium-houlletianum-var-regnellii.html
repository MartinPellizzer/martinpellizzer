<p>Lepismium houlletianum var. regnellii, commonly known as the Regnell's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It features long, slender stems covered in dense, velvety foliage and produces clusters of pale pink or white, fragrant flowers with intricate, lip-like structures. The plant thrives in high humidity and dappled shade, often growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
