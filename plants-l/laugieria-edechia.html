<p>Laugieria edechia, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Laugieria edechia is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
