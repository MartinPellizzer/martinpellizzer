                    <h1>Litobrochia breviloba</h1>
<p>Litobrochia breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-lobed litobrochium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or white, adapted to pollination by wind or specialized insects. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
