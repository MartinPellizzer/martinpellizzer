                    <h1>Lolium rigidum var. rottboellioides</h1>
<p>Lolium rigidum var. rottboellioides, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
