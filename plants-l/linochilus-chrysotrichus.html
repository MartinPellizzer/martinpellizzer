                    <h1>Linochilus chrysotrichus</h1>
<p>Linochilus chrysotrichus, commonly known as the golden-haired orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow inflorescence and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are relatively small but numerous, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
