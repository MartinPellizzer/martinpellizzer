<p>Lastrea spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Lastrea spinulosa is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient addition to xeriscapes.</p>
