                    <h1>Linaria arvensis var. glanduloso-viscosissima</h1>
<p>Linaria arvensis var. glanduloso-viscosissima, commonly known as the glandular-viscous common toadflax, is a variant of the common toadflax species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its glandular and viscid (sticky) surfaces, which are adaptations for deterring herbivores and reducing water loss. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, with two lips, and are arranged in racemes.</p>
<p>Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
