                    <h1>Loranthus viridizonatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus viridizonatus, commonly known as the green-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to a host tree through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is often found on trees such as Acacia and Euphorbia. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its berries are red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
