<p>Lithops turbiniformis var. elephina, commonly known as the "Elephant's Foot" lithops, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble miniature stone formations, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. Its leaves are thick and crinkled, storing water to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and collections.</p>
