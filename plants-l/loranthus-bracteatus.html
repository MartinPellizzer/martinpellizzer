                    <h1>Loranthus bracteatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus bracteatus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellow in color. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus bracteatus is found in various regions of Asia and is often associated with species of the genus Ficus.</p>
