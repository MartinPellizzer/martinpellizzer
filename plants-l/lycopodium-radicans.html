                    <h1>Lycopodium radicans</h1>
<p>Lycopodium radicans, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground and produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clustered structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium radicans thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
