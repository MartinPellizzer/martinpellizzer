<p>Leptochloa humilis, commonly known as the dwarf grass or small-leaved grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or tufts and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
