                    <h1>Lycopodium miniatosporum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium miniatosporum, commonly known as the miniature spore clubmoss, is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a short, upright stem that produces spore-bearing structures called strobila. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal via wind, a common trait among primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>Lycopodium miniatosporum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
