                    <h1>Leptogramma himalaica</h1>
<p>Leptogramma himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan leptogramma, is a rare fern species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
