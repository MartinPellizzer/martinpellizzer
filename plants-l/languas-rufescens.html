                    <h1>Languas rufescens</h1>
<p>Languas rufescens, commonly known as the red-hued mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or orange in color, which contain the seeds for propagation. Languas rufescens is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic relationship with host trees and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
