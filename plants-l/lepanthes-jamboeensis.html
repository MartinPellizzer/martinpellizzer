                    <h1>Lepanthes jamboeensis</h1>
<p>Lepanthes jamboeensis, commonly known as the Jamaican orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the humid forests of Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly colorful, showy flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lepanthes jamboeensis is considered a threatened species.</p>
