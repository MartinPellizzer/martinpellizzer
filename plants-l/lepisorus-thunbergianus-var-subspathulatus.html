                    <h1>Lepisorus thunbergianus var. subspathulatus</h1>
<p>Lepisorus thunbergianus var. subspathulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea, where it typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a compact, creeping growth habit with short, rhizomatous stems that produce clusters of small, bright green leaves. Its spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are borne on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
