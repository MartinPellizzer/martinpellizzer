<p>Lotus zemmouriensis, commonly known as the Zemmouriensis water-hemp, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant features floating leaves with a waxy surface and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
