                    <h1>Lotoxalis</h1>
<p>Lotoxalis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Lotoxalis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce showy, yellow or orange flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
