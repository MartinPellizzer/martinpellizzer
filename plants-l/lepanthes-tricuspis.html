<p>Lepanthes tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral structure.</p>
