                    <h1>Leucantha cyanifolia</h1>
<p>Leucantha cyanifolia, commonly known as the blue-leafed beauty, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant blue-green foliage, which is due to the presence of a unique pigment called cyanin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment.</p>
<p>Leucantha cyanifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
