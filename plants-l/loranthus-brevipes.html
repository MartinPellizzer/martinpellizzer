                    <h1>Loranthus brevipes</h1>
<p>Loranthus brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to various host trees, primarily in the families Rosaceae and Fagaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of the Americas, including parts of the southeastern United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant parasitism and ecological interactions.</p>
