<p>Linaria pelliceriana, commonly known as the desert snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and bright yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are tubular in shape with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family.</p>
<p>Linaria pelliceriana is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water.</p>
