<p>Lunathyrium lobatocrenatum, commonly known as the broad-crested lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically bright green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on rock surfaces or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
