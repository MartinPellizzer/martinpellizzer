                    <h1>Loranthus yadoriki</h1>
<p>Loranthus yadoriki, commonly known as the Japanese mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds to new host trees. Its hemiparasitic nature means it derives some nutrients from its host but can also photosynthesize.</p>
<p>Loranthus yadoriki is native to East Asia and is often found in forested areas.</p>
