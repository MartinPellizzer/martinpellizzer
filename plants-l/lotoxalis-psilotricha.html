                    <h1>Lotoxalis psilotricha</h1>
<p>Lotoxalis psilotricha, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a complex symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus that is covered with a fine, silky layer of fungal hyphae, which gives it its characteristic appearance. The algal component provides photosynthetic capability, while the fungal partner offers protection and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This symbiotic structure allows Lotoxalis psilotricha to thrive in nutrient-poor environments where other plants may struggle.</p>
