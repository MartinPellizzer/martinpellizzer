<p>Lycopodium fontinaloides var. mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican ground pine, is a species of clubmoss native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that forms dense mats on rocky or shaded soils. The plant has needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally around the stem, giving it a pine-like appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, typical of its ancient lineage in the lycophyte group.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, humid environments, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
