                    <h1>Leontopodium pusillum</h1>
<p>Leontopodium pusillum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a symbol of resilience in alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
