                    <h1>Loranthus ambiguus var. sulcatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ambiguus var. sulcatus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host trees through haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and typically grows on the branches of various hardwood trees. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. It produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
