                    <h1>Laphamia coronopifolia</h1>
<p>Laphamia coronopifolia, commonly known as the whiteleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white thallus, which is covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is often used as an indicator of air quality.</p>
