<p>Larix americana, commonly known as the American larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden yellow in the fall before shedding. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>The American larch is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
