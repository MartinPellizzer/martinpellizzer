                    <h1>Loranthus epigaeus</h1>
<p>Loranthus epigaeus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds. Its seeds are dispersed by these birds, which eat the berries and excrete the seeds onto other trees.</p>
<p>Loranthus epigaeus is found in various regions of the world, including Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
