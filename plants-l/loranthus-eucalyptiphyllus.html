                    <h1>Loranthus eucalyptiphyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus eucalyptiphyllus, commonly known as the eucalyptus mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to eucalyptus trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in spikes. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy berries.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is an important part of the ecological interactions within eucalyptus forests.</p>
