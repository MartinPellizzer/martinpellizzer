                    <h1>Lupinus deflexus</h1>
<p>Lupinus deflexus, commonly known as the bent lupin, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of pea-like, blue to violet flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Lupinus deflexus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
