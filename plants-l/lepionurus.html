                    <h1>Lepionurus</h1>
<p>Lepionurus, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive seed head called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Lepionurus is a hardy perennial that thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
