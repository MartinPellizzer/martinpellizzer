<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat.

<p>Lepidium tournefortii is adapted to thrive in harsh, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland environments.</p>
