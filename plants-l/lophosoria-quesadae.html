                    <h1>Lophosoria quesadae</h1>
<p>Lophosoria quesadae, commonly known as the Quezada's lophosoria, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other epiphytic ferns. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for hydration. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Lophosoria quesadae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
