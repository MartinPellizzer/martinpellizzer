                    <h1>Lewisia rediviva var. minor</h1>
<p>Lewisia rediviva var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf Lewisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Oregon and northern California.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Lewisia rediviva, with shorter stems and compact growth habits.</p>
