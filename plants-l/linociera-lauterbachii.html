<p>Linociera lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linociera lauterbachii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
