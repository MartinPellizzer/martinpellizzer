<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually large and革质 (leathery), adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its environment.</p>
