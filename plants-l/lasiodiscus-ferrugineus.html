                    <h1>Lasiodiscus ferrugineus</h1>
<p>Lasiodiscus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty disc lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive reddish-brown coloration due to the presence of ferruginous pigments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in humid, temperate environments. The thallus is loosely structured with a thick, leathery upper layer and a spongy lower cortex. It is characterized by its irregularly shaped lobes and a granular texture.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in shaded areas and is used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
