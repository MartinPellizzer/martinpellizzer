<p>Lampranthus leightoniae, commonly known as the Orange Carpet, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, thick, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lampranthus leightoniae is popular in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
