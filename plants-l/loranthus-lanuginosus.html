                    <h1>Loranthus lanuginosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
