                    <h1>Lycopodium empetrifolium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium empetrifolium, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique plant that belongs to the class Lycophyta, which includes clubmosses and their relatives.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has specialized structures called rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. This species is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, scale-like leaves are clustered around the stem, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native habitats.</p>
