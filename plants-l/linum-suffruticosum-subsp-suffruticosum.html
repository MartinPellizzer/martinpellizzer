<p>Linum suffruticosum subsp.</p>
<p>suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers with five petals, typical of the Linaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
