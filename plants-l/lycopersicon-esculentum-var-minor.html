                    <h1>Lycopersicon esculentum var. minor</h1>
<p>Lycopersicon esculentum var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf tomato, is a compact variety of the domesticated tomato plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller size, typically reaching only a few inches in height, making it ideal for container gardening and small spaces. The plant produces small, often cherry-sized fruits that are typically red, though some cultivars may exhibit yellow or orange hues. It shares the same botanical features as the common tomato, including a fleshy fruit with a central core and a thick, fibrous mesocarp.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its early maturity and high yield in confined environments.</p>
