<p>Lycopodium alopecuroides var. nettoanum, commonly known as the Nettoanum clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with closely arranged, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, or cone-like structures, that bear the sporangia containing spores. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its small size and unique reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
