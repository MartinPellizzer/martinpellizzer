                            <h1>Lithocarpus Cyrtocarpus</h1>
<p>Lithocarpus cyrtocarpus is a rare and enigmatic evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. Known for its hard, dense wood and distinctive elliptical leaves, this species plays a vital role in its native ecosystems. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and chestnuts, though it is less well-known than its more common relatives. The tree's unique floral structure and slow growth rate make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lithocarpus cyrtocarpus faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
