<p>Linaria uralensis, commonly known as the Ural toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in alpine and steppe environments. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, resembling those of the common toadflax species. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Linaria uralensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>
