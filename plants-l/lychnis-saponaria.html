                    <h1>Lychnis saponaria</h1>
<p>Lychnis saponaria, commonly known as soapwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs and produces clusters of pink or red, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and slightly succulent. Soapwort is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its common name derives from the sap's historical use in making soap due to its saponin content.</p>
