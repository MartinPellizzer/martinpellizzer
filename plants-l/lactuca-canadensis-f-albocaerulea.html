                    <h1>Lactuca canadensis f. albocaerulea</h1>
<p>Lactuca canadensis f. albocaerulea, commonly known as the Canadian blue lettuce, is a botanical variant of the common lettuce species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-tinged leaves, which result from a unique genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. This form is typically smaller than the standard Lactuca canadensis, with a more compact growth habit. The plant is native to North America and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialty collections.</p>
