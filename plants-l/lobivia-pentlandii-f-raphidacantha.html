<p>Lobivia pentlandii f. raphidacantha, commonly known as the Raphidacantha Lobivia, is a compact, branching cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features short, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, adorned with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring.

Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to thrive in full sun with minimal water.</p>
