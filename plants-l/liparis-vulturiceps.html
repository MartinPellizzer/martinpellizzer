                    <h1>Liparis vulturiceps</h1>
<p>Liparis vulturiceps, commonly known as the vulture's beak orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a vulture's beak, with a prominent, downward-curving lip. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of green and white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis vulturiceps is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
