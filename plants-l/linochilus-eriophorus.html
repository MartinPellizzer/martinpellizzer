<p>Linochilus eriophorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved linochilus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Its small size and specialized morphology make it a unique subject of study in alpine botany.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
