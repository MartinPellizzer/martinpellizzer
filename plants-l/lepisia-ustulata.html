                    <h1>Lepisia ustulata</h1>
<p>Lepisia ustulata, commonly known as the fireplant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lepisia ustulata is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
