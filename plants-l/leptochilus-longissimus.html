<p>Leptochilus longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear leaves, which help it thrive in moist environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, typical of many orchid species. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to survive in wetland conditions.</p>
<p>Leptochilus longissimus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
