                    <h1>Lycopodium selago var. saururoides</h1>
<p>Lycopodium selago var. saururoides, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it forms dense mats on the ground. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, releasing them from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in stabilizing soil in woodland ecosystems.</p>
