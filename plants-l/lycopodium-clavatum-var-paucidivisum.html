                    <h1>Lycopodium clavatum var. paucidivisum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium clavatum var. paucidivisum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss family (Lycopodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features compact, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branching stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its reduced number of divisions in its sporophyte structure, which is a key botanical feature distinguishing it from other lycopodium species.</p>
