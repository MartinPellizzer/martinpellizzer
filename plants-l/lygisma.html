<p>Lygisma, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are found in wetland habitats across the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have tall, erect stems with showy, often violet or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Lygisma species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth and ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
