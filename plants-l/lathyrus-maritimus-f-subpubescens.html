                    <h1>Lathyrus maritimus f. subpubescens</h1>
<p>Lathyrus maritimus f. subpubescens, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant in coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>The subspecies subpubescens is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which provides protection against salt spray and wind.</p>
