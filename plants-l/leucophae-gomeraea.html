                    <h1>Leucophae gomeraea</h1>
<p>Leucophae gomeraea, commonly known as the Gomera lichen, is a rare and endemic lichen species found exclusively on the island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its pale, whitish to pale yellowish thallus. The lichen forms a crustose growth on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, humid microhabitats. It is considered a relict species, surviving in isolated pockets due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and vulnerable organism.</p>
