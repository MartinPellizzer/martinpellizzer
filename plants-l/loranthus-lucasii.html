                    <h1>Loranthus lucasii</h1>
<p>Loranthus lucasii, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both a beneficial and potentially harmful species.</p>
