<p>Lastrea mollissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range.</p>
