                    <h1>Lenophyllum</h1>
<p>Lenophyllum, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants that belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Lenophyllum species are native to tropical and temperate regions around the world, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes, while their leaves form a floating mat on the water's surface.</p>
<p>The flowers of Lenophyllum typically open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
