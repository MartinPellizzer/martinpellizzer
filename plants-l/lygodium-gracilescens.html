<p>Lygodium gracilescens, commonly known as the slender climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that form a dense, climbing structure. The plant typically grows along forest floors or on tree trunks, utilizing its rhizomes to spread horizontally. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Lygodium gracilescens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
