                    <h1>Lechea surculosa</h1>
<p>Lechea surculosa, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its thick, spongy thallus that can grow up to several centimeters in diameter. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients and sunlight. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable indicator species for environmental health.</p>
