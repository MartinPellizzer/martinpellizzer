                    <h1>Lithospermum graminifolium</h1>
<p>Lithospermum graminifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved lithospermum, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, giving it a distinctive appearance among other members of the Boraginaceae family.</p>
<p>Lithospermum graminifolium is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
