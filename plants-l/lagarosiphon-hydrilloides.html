<p>Lagarosiphon hydrilloides, commonly known as water thistle, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It has long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often forming dense mats in still or slow-moving water. The plant features small, whorled leaves that are usually narrow and pointed, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, floating fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting water ecosystems.</p>
