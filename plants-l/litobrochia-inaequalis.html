                    <h1>Litobrochia inaequalis</h1>
<p>Litobrochia inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal-stemmed brochidium, is a rare and specialized cactus species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in late winter or early spring. Its adaptations include a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently in its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Litobrochia inaequalis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
