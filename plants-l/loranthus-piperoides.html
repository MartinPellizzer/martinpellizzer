                    <h1>Loranthus piperoides</h1>
<p>Loranthus piperoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to the Indian subcontinent and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
