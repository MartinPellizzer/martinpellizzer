                            <h1>Lupinus Latifolius Var. Columbianus</h1>
<p>Columbian lupine, scientifically known as Lupinus latifolius var. columbianus, is a striking member of the legume family native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. This plant is characterized by its tall, erect growth and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in open meadows and disturbed areas. The lupine's ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it an important pioneer species in ecological restoration projects. Its ecological and ornamental value has made it a subject of both scientific study and horticultural interest.</p>
