                    <h1>Lonchocarpus muehlbergianus f. angustifoliolata</h1>
<p>Lonchocarpus muehlbergianus f. angustifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed serpentine bean, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with the terminal leaflet being notably narrower than the lateral ones. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils, particularly serpentine soils, and is often found in rocky, open habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies related to plant adaptation and soil chemistry.</p>
