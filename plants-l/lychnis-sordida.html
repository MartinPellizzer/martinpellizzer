                    <h1>Lychnis sordida</h1>
<p>Lychnis sordida, commonly known as the stinking roseroot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers are in full bloom.</p>
