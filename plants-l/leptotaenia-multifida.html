                    <h1>Leptotaenia multifida</h1>
<p>Leptotaenia multifida, commonly known as the fragrant fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Leptotaenia multifida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
