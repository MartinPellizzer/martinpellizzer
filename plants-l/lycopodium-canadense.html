                    <h1>Lycopodium canadense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium canadense, commonly known as the Canadian clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its production of spore-bearing cones called strobili. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are spirally arranged and have a needle-like appearance, contributing to its resemblance to a miniature pine tree.</p>
<p>Lycopodium canadense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
