<p>Lemna polyrhiza, commonly known as watermeal, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the order Alismatales.</p>
<p>It is a free-floating species that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having specialized structures called fronds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped fronds that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter. It reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Lemna polyrhiza is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
