                            <h1>Linum Spicatum</h1>
<p>Linum spicatum is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is commonly known as the spiny flax or prickly flax due to its distinctive bristly stems and leaves. This plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Linum spicatum is not only ornamental but also has historical uses in dye production and traditional herbal medicine.</p>
