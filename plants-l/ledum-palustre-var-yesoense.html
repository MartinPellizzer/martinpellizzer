<p>Ledum palustre var. yesoense, commonly known as the Yesoese Labrador tea, is a variant of the broad-leafed Labrador tea native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, leathery, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its medicinal uses by indigenous peoples, who have traditionally used it for its antiseptic and analgesic properties.</p>
