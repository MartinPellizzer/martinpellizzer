                    <h1>Lycium glossophyllum</h1>
<p>Lycium glossophyllum, commonly known as the desert枸杞, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and red berries that mature in the fall. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against intense sunlight and drought.</p>
<p>Lycium glossophyllum plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
