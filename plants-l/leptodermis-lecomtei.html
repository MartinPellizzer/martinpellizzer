<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a compact cluster of leaves.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds.</p>
