                    <h1>Loranthus lepidaria</h1>
<p>Loranthus lepidaria, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds by birds, which consume the fleshy, sticky aril surrounding the seeds.</p>
