                    <h1>Lathyrus fruticosus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Lathyrus fruticosus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
