                    <h1>Leptogramma mollissima var. yakusimensis</h1>
<p>Leptogramma mollissima var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakusim fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in cool, humid forests at high elevations. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are positioned on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
