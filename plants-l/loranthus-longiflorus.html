                    <h1>Loranthus longiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and its leaves are simple and opposite. It is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open forest habitats.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
