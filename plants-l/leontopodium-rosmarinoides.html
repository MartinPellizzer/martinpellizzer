<p>Leontopodium rosmarinoides, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow flowers, which are surrounded by a layer of fuzzy, bract-like leaves. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and beauty in alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and vulnerability to climate change, it is also a protected species in many regions.</p>
