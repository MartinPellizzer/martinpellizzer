<p>Levenhookia leptantha, commonly known as the slender-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
