<p>Leptospermum paludosum, commonly known as swamp tea, is a shrub native to Australia, particularly found in swampy and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its flowers are attractive to insects, making it an important plant for pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
