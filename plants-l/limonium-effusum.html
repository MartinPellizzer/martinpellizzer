                    <h1>Limonium effusum</h1>
<p>Limonium effusum, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Limonium effusum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
