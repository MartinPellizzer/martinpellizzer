<p>Lasiopogon ponticulus, commonly known as the Pontic rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, riverbanks, and damp woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Lasiopogon ponticulus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
