                    <h1>Loranthus peralatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus peralatus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Asia and is often associated with species of the family Rutaceae.</p>
