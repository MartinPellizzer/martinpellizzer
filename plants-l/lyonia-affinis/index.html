                            <h1>Lyonia Affinis</h1>
<p>Lyonia affinis is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Known for its small, bell-shaped white flowers, it blooms in late spring and early summer. The plant is also called the "flowering azalea" due to its resemblance to azaleas. Its unique beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
