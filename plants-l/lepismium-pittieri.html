                    <h1>Lepismium pittieri</h1>
<p>Lepismium pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the萝藦科 (Asclepiadaceae) family.</p>
<p>Native to the Andean regions of South America, it is characterized by its unique, ghostly white flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant is a climbing vine with tuberous roots, adapted to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Lepismium pittieri is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
