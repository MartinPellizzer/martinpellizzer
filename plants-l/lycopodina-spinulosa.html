<p>Lycopodina spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny lycopod, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodina spinulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
