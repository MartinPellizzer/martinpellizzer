                    <h1>Lingoum erinaceum</h1>
<p>Lingoum erinaceum, commonly known as the hedgehog lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety thallus covered in small, rounded lobes that resemble the spines of a hedgehog. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, and soil in shaded, moist areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
