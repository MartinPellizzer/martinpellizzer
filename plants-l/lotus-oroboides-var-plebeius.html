                    <h1>Lotus oroboides var. plebeius</h1>
<p>Lotus oroboides var. plebeius, commonly known as the small lotus or the dwarf water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and pinkish-white, emerging on slender stalks above the water.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
