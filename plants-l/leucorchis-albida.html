                    <h1>Leucorchis albida</h1>
<p>Leucorchis albida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white petals and sepals, which give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers are small and clustered, often blooming in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucorchis albida is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
