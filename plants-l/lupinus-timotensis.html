<p>Lupinus timotensis, commonly known as the Timot lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in the spring. Lupinus timotensis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
