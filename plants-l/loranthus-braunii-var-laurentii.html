                    <h1>Loranthus braunii var. laurentii</h1>
<p>Loranthus braunii var. laurentii, commonly known as the laurentii mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming a hemiparasitic relationship. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions and is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations.</p>
