<p>Leonurus marrubiastrum var. simplicissimus, commonly known as lesser hedgehogweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are hairy and branching, with opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
