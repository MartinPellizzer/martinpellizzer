<p>Lotodes capitatum, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that support a dense cluster of showy, fragrant flowers. The plant has a short rhizome that anchors it in shallow water, and its roots absorb nutrients from the surrounding water. Its flowers typically open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms.</p>
