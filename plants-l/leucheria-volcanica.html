<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor volcanic soils and requires cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
