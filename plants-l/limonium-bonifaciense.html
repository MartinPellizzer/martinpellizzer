                    <h1>Limonium bonifaciense</h1>
<p>Limonium bonifaciense, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Limonium bonifaciense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh, coastal conditions.</p>
