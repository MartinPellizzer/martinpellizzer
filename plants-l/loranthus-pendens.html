                    <h1>Loranthus pendens</h1>
<p>Loranthus pendens, commonly known as the hanging mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a pendulous manner from its host.</p>
