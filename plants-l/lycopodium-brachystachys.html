<p>Lycopodium brachystachys, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Lycopodium brachystachys is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices, where it plays a role in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
