<p>Lycium cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered toxic to humans. Lycium cooperi thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a decorative plant in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
