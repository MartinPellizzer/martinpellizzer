                    <h1>Lasianthera secundiflora</h1>
<p>Lasianthera secundiflora, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and adapted for water storage, making it resilient to drought.</p>
<p>Lasianthera secundiflora is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry landscapes.</p>
