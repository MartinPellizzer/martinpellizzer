<p>Lobivia chrysacantha, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a succulent native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with a crown of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has spiny, segmented stems that help it store water, adapting to its arid environment. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
