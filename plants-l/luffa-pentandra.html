<p>Luffa pentandra, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, spongy fruit that matures into a lightweight, porous structure. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters.

<p>Luffa pentandra thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
