                    <h1>Lycopodium × sabinifolium var. sharonense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium × sabinifolium var. sharonense, commonly known as the Sharon Clubmoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. It is native to specific regions in the eastern Mediterranean, particularly in Israel and the West Bank, where it grows in rocky soils and forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
