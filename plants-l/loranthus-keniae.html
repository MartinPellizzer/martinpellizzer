                    <h1>Loranthus keniae</h1>
<p>Loranthus keniae, commonly known as the Kenia mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the fleshy, yellowish berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus keniae is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and woodland regions.</p>
