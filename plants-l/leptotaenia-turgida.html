                    <h1>Leptotaenia turgida</h1>
<p>Leptotaenia turgida, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. These bladders are filled with air and help the plant float on the water's surface. The plant is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and specialized adaptations make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
