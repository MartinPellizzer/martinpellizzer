                <h1>Lasiacis rhizophora</h1>
<p>Lasiacis rhizophora, commonly known as the mangrove tree, is a halophyte species that thrives in saline coastal environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. The plant exhibits a unique ability to excrete excess salt through its leaves, enabling survival in brackish water conditions. Its prop roots provide structural support and aid in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Lasiacis rhizophora plays a crucial role in preventing erosion and supporting biodiversity in mangrove forests.</p>
