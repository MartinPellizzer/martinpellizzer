                    <h1>Ledum palustre f. denudatum</h1>
<p>Ledum palustre f. denudatum, commonly known as the naked alder or slender labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its distinctive, often hairless foliage.</p>
<p>It typically features small, dark green, oval leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form of Ledum palustre.</p>
