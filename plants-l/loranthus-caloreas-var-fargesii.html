                    <h1>Loranthus caloreas var. fargesii</h1>
<p>Loranthus caloreas var. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, primarily in the genus Betula.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China and is often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its hemiparasitic nature, relying on the host for essential nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
