                    <h1>Leptonychia semlikensis</h1>
<p>Leptonychia semlikensis, commonly known as the Semlikensis lichen, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crust-like thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. This lichen thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate forest regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological health.</p>
