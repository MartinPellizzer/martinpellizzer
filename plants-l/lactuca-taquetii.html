                    <h1>Lactuca taquetii</h1>
<p>Lactuca taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's lettuce, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of northern Africa, particularly Morocco and Algeria, where it thrives in rocky and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, pale green leaves that are generally not cultivated for consumption due to its limited availability and specific growing conditions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Despite its botanical interest, Lactuca taquetii remains poorly studied and is not widely recognized in horticultural practices.</p>
