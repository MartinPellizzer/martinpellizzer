<p>Lasiorrhiza salinae, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in soils with high salt content, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate extreme conditions make it a resilient species.</p>
<p>Lasiorrhiza salinae plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
