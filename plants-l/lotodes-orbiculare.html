<p>Lotodes orbiculare, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are rounded and often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, which open during the day and close at night. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still water bodies, and it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in water makes it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and water gardens.</p>
