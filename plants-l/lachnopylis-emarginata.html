                    <h1>Lachnopylis emarginata</h1>
<p>Lachnopylis emarginata, commonly known as the marginated lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale to dark green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on rocks and tree bark in humid environments. It is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
<p>Its morphology and chemical composition make it valuable for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
