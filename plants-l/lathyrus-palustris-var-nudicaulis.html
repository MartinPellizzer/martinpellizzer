<p>Lathyrus palustris var. nudicaulis, commonly known as the slender marsh vetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats in moist soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.
