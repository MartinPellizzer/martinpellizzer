                    <h1>Lobivia nealeana</h1>
<p>Lobivia nealeana, commonly known as the Neale's lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a common adaptation in desert plants to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Lobivia nealeana is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
