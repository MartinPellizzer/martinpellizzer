                    <h1>Liebigia dissimilis</h1>
<p>Liebigia dissimilis, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adhering layer on rock surfaces, typically in humid and shaded environments. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on limestone or sandstone substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
