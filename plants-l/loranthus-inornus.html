                    <h1>Loranthus inornus</h1>
<p>Loranthus inornus, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through itshausts, which are specialized structures that penetrate the host's bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on native trees such as eucalyptus or acacia.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on the health of its host tree.</p>
