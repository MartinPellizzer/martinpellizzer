<p>Linosyris maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, spiny bracts around its flower heads. It is often found growing on dunes and rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Linosyris maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions.</p>
