                    <h1>Loranthus exocarpi var. spathulatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus exocarpi var. spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, and typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress on its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
