<p>Lagerstroemia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy ligustrum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The hairy hirsuta refers to the soft, hairy texture of its young stems and leaves.</p>
