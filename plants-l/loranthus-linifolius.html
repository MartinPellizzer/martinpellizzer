                    <h1>Loranthus linifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus linifolius, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus linifolius is found in various regions of Asia and is often associated with specific host species such as citrus and mulberry trees.</p>
