<p>Lundia nitidula var. virginalis, commonly known as the white-flowered lundia, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white petals that contrast with its green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
