                    <h1>Lycopodium trichiatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium trichiatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Lycopodium trichiatum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many ancient plant species.</p>
<p>Its structure and life cycle provide insights into the evolution of early terrestrial plants.</p>
