<p>Lindsaea parkeri subsp.</p>
<p>steyermarkiana, commonly known as the Steyermark's lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Central America. It features a wiry, creeping rhizome with lanceolate, acuminate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
