<p>Lophophora alberto-vojtechii, commonly known as the "Alberto-Vojtechii Peyote," is a species of cactus native to the Mexican state of Coahuila.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a milky sap that contains psychoactive alkaloids, primarily mescaline. It thrives in arid, rocky environments and requires minimal water, making it well-adapted to its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and chemical composition, it is of interest to both botanists and ethnobotrists.</p>
