                    <h1>Leiphaimos parasitica</h1>
<p>Leiphaimos parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a unique flowering plant that exhibits hemiparasitic traits, deriving some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can access suitable host species. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually green or white in color, adapting to its low-light habitat. Its roots are specialized to attach to host plants, forming a symbiotic relationship that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Leiphaimos parasitica plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by influencing host plant populations and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
