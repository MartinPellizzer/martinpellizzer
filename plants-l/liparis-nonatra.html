<p>Liparis nonatra, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its flowers are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Liparis nonatra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
