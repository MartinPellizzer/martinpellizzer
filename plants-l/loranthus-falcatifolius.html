                    <h1>Loranthus falcatifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus falcatifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are usually inconspicuous and followed by small, fleshy berries. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
