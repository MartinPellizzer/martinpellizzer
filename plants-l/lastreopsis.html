<p>Lastreopsis, commonly known as the "spoon liverwort," is a genus of small, terrestrial liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They are characterized by their simple, thalloid structure with a leaf-like body that is often segmented. The leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern and may have a distinct, spoon-shaped appearance.</p>
<p>Lastreopsis species are important in ecological studies due to their role in soil stabilization and as indicators of environmental conditions.</p>
