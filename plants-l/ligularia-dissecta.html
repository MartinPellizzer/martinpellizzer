                    <h1>Ligularia dissecta</h1>
<p>Ligularia dissecta, commonly known as the heartleaf arrowhead, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are often green with a metallic sheen, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
<p>Ligularia dissecta is well-suited for water gardens and bog gardens due to its preference for consistently damp soil.</p>
