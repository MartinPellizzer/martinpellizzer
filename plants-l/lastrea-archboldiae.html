<p>Lastrea archboldiae, commonly known as the Florida starlingflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal hammocks and sandy soils, adapting to the unique environmental conditions of its habitat. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
