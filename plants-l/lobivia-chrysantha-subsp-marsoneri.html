<p>Lobivia chrysantha subsp.</p>
<p>marsoneri, commonly known as the Sonoran Desert lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Sonoran Desert region. It features dense, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It has small, spiny areoles and is adapted to thrive in arid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and succulent gardens.</p>
