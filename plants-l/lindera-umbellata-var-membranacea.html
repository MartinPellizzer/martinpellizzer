                    <h1>Lindera umbellata var. membranacea</h1>
<p>Lindera umbellata var. membranacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweet pepper tree, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Lindera umbellata.</p>
