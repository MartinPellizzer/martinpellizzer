<p>Lapeirousia erythrantha var. setifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered bulbous orchid, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Iridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces underground bulbs that store nutrients for the flowering season. Native to the Western and Northern Cape provinces, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected in its natural habitat.</p>
