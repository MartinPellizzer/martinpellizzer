                            <h1>Lomatium Dasycarpum Subsp. Tomentosum</h1>
<p>Lomatium dasycarpum subsp. tomentosum is a lesser-known member of the parsley family native to the western United States. This subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage and robust root system. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in high elevation areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it has become a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated and overlooked in mainstream horticulture.</p>
