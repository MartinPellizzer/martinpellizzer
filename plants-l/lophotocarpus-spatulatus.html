<p>Lophotocarpus spatulatus, commonly known as the flat-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Roccellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is often found on rocks and tree trunks in humid, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Its morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species for certain forest ecosystems.</p>
