<p>Lindsaea taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Taiwan and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in montane forests. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Lindsaea taiwaniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
