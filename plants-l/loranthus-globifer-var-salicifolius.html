                    <h1>Loranthus globifer var. salicifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus globifer var. salicifolius, commonly known as the willow-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily willows.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stem-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by small, fleshy berries containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in temperate forest environments.</p>
