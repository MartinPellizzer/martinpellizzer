<p>Lomaria palustris, commonly known as the marsh lomatia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, with its slender, wiry stems often lying close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Lomaria palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
