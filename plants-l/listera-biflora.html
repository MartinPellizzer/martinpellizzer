<p>Listera biflora, commonly known as the twin-flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals that resemble small bells. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas, often forming a rosette of lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dark blue or black berries in the summer.</p>
<p>Listera biflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
