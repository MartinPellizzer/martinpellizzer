<p>Loxogramme suberosa, commonly known as the rough water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features submerged, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss and enhances buoyancy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for aquatic ecosystems, supporting a variety of invertebrates and fish.</p>
