                    <h1>Liparis clareae var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Liparis clareae var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to moist, shaded habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a slender, creeping rhizome with erect, linear leaves that are often narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is usually narrower than the other petals. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wet meadows, along stream banks, and in damp woodlands where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
