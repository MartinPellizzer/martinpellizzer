                    <h1>Lasiospora eriolaena</h1>
<p>Lasiospora eriolaena, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly growth of white to pale yellow filaments, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on rock surfaces in temperate and arctic regions. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
