<p>Lygoplis horridum, commonly known as the rough horkstall, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
