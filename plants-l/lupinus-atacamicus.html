                    <h1>Lupinus atacamicus</h1>
<p>Lupinus atacamicus, commonly known as the Atacama lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is adapted to extreme drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. The plant produces tall, spindly stems with clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Lupinus atacamicus plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and is an important species for ecological studies in harsh environments.</p>
