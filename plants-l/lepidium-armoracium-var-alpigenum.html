<p>Lepidium armoracium var. alpigenum, commonly known as alpine peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, harsh environments. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its resilience and is often found in mountainous habitats where few plants can survive.</p>
