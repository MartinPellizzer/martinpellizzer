                    <h1>Lecanopteris ampla</h1>
<p>Lecanopteris ampla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in rice paddies and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize water bodies and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance that aids in light absorption for photosynthesis.</p>
