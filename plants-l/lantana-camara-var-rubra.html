                    <h1>Lantana camara var. rubra</h1>
<p>Lantana camara var. rubra, commonly known as red lantana, is a flowering shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically red, orange, or yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
