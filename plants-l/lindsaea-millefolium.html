                    <h1>Lindsaea millefolium</h1>
<p>Lindsaea millefolium, commonly known as the feather-leaf tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it capture moisture from the air. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>Its unique structure allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments where it can absorb nutrients through its leaves.</p>
