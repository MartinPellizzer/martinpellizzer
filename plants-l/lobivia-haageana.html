<p>Lobivia haageana, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is a small, compact cactus with a short, thick stem and a cluster of spiny, ribbed stems that form a dense, globular shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has adapted to survive in extreme arid conditions with minimal water requirements and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
