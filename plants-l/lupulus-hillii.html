                    <h1>Lupulus hillii</h1>
<p>Lupulus hillii, commonly known as the Hill's hops, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its fibrous, rhizomatous root system and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which develop into dry, three-lobed fruits. Lupulus hillii is notable for its use in traditional medicine, where its leaves and roots are employed for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Its cultivation is limited due to its specific ecological requirements and the challenges of its natural habitat.</p>
