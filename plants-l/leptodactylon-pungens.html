                    <h1>Leptodactylon pungens</h1>
<p>Leptodactylon pungens, commonly known as the spiny lichen, is a unique species that exhibits both lichen and moss-like characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has leaf-like lobes that are typically flattened and broad. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its surface is often covered with small, spiny structures that provide protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Leptodactylon pungens is commonly found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forest regions.</p>
