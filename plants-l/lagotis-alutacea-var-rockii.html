                    <h1>Lagotis alutacea var. rockii</h1>
<p>Lagotis alutacea var. rockii, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
