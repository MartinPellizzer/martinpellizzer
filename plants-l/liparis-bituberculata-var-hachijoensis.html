                    <h1>Liparis bituberculata var. hachijoensis</h1>
<p>Liparis bituberculata var. hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo Islands orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Hachijo Islands in Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent, spurred petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
