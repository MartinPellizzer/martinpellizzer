                    <h1>Litchi chinensis f. glomeriflora</h1>
<p>Litchi chinensis f. glomeriflora, commonly known as the clustered-flowered litchi, is a botanical variant of the litchi tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of flowers, which are typically more compact than those of the standard litchi. The plant produces small, red, hairy fruits that are typically smaller than the common litchi. It is native to southern China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variety make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and genetic studies.</p>
