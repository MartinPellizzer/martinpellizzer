                    <h1>Lagenophora lechleri</h1>
<p>Lagenophora lechleri, commonly known as the Amazonian rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a milky latex sap that has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is closely related to the hevea brasiliensis, another rubber-producing species. Its latex contains natural rubber and has traditional medicinal uses.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
