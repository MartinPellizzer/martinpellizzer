                    <h1>Lycopodium tetrapterygium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium tetrapterygium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that grows from a rhizome, typically in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Lycopodium tetrapterygium is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its structure and life cycle provide insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
