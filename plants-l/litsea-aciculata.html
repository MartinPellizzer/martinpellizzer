                    <h1>Litsea aciculata</h1>
<p>Litsea aciculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved litsea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that give it a pine-like appearance, though it is not a true conifer. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Litsea aciculata is also valued for its aromatic wood and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
