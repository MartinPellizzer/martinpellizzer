<p>Lazarum wilbertii, commonly known as the Wilbert's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots forming a network that helps it absorb moisture from the humid environment. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Lazarum wilbertii is listed as critically endangered by conservation organizations.</p>
