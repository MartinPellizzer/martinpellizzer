                    <h1>Lachnaea globulifera var. coerulescens</h1>
<p>Lachnaea globulifera var. coerulescens, commonly known as the blue globular lichen, is a type of foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive blue-green coloration due to the presence of specific pigments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on calcareous rock surfaces in temperate regions, forming dense, cushion-like growths. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes small, rounded lobes with a smooth upper surface and a more textured lower surface.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for monitoring air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
