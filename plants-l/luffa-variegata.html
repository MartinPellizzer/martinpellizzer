                    <h1>Luffa variegata</h1>
<p>Luffa variegata, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and large, asymmetrical fruits that mature to a yellowish or greenish color. The fruit's sponge-like interior develops from a fibrous outer layer, making it useful for exfoliation. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for both culinary and ornamental purposes.</p>
