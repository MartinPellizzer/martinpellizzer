The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it blooms during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils in Mediterranean climates.</p>
