                    <h1>Lomaria decurrens</h1>
<p>Lomaria decurrens, commonly known as the spreading lomaria, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>Lomaria decurrens is often used in rock gardens due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
