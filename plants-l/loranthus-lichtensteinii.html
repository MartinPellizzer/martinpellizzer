                    <h1>Loranthus lichtensteinii</h1>
<p>Loranthus lichtensteinii, commonly known as the Lichtenstein's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the African savanna.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife.</p>
