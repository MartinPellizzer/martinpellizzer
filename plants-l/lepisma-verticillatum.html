                    <h1>Lepisma verticillatum</h1>
<p>Lepisma verticillatum, commonly known as the tufted moss spider, is a small, delicate plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, moss-like growth pattern and small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed. The plant lacks true stems and roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It is often found in humid, forested areas where it contributes to the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is typically overlooked in ecological studies despite its role in soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
