                    <h1>Lewisia rupicola</h1>
<p>Lewisia rupicola, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers in the spring, which bloom on slender stems above the foliage. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to alpine and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
