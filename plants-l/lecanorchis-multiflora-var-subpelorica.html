                    <h1>Lecanorchis multiflora var. subpelorica</h1>
<p>Lecanorchis multiflora var. subpelorica, commonly known as the purple-stemmed twayblade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with a single spike of small, pale yellow or greenish flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette and are covered in a fine, hairy layer that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in shaded, humid forest environments.</p>
