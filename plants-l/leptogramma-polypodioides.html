<p>Leptogramma polypodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Leptogramma polypodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
