<p>Liparis reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, with petals that curve backward, giving it its common name.
