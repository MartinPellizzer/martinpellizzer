<p>Lappa vulgaris var. major, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface and a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white flowers, which are followed by long, slender fruits containing seeds. It is characterized by its milky, photosensitive sap that can cause severe skin irritation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
