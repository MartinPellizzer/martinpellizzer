                    <h1>Leopoldia</h1>
<p>Leopoldia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and its unique ability to grow on trees rather than in soil. The plant has no leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
