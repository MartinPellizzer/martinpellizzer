<p>Lobelia heterophylla subsp.</p>
<p>pilbarensis, commonly known as the Pilbara lobelia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky soils or on sand dunes. Its flowering period typically occurs during the cooler months, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
