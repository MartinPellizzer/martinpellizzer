                    <h1>Lepanthes uribei</h1>
<p>Lepanthes uribei, commonly known as the Urib√© slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several flowers arranged in a spiral. Lepanthes uribei is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the biodiversity of tropical ecosystems.</p>
