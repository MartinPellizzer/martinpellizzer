<p>Lindsaea odontolabia, commonly known as the toothed lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
