                    <h1>Loranthus clusiifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus clusiifolius, commonly known as the red or yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily from the Clusiaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the sunlight that reaches its leaves. The plant has small, alternate leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an ecological role in supporting biodiversity by providing food and habitat for various wildlife.</p>
