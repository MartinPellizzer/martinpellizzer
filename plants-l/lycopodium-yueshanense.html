<p>Lycopodium yueshanense, commonly known as the Yueshan clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing strobila, which is typically clustered at the tips of its stems. The plant has a creeping growth habit with small, scale-like leaves that form a dense mat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
