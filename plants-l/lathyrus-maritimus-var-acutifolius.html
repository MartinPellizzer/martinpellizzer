                    <h1>Lathyrus maritimus var. acutifolius</h1>
<p>Lathyrus maritimus var. acutifolius, commonly known as the sharp-leaved field bean, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with sharply pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in coastal ecosystems.</p>
