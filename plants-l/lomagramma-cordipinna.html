                    <h1>Lomagramma cordipinna</h1>
<p>Lomagramma cordipinna, commonly known as the heart-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive success.</p>
