<p>Lycopodium obscurum f. brevispicatum, commonly known as the short-spored clubmoss, is a rare and compact form of the common clubmoss.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely spaced spore cones and reduced spore leaves. This fern ally typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte structure includes a short, stout stem with whorled leaves.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on evolutionary botany and plant morphology.</p>
