<p>Lotus corniculatus f. longepedunculatus, commonly known as the long pedunculate bird's-foot trefoil, is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically arranged in elongated, drooping clusters. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its longer peduncles, which give it a more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Lotus corniculatus.</p>
