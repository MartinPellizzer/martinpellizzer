                    <h1>Leontopodium haplophylloides</h1>
<p>Leontopodium haplophylloides, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in rocky or alpine meadows. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions.</p>
