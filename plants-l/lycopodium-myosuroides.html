                    <h1>Lycopodium myosuroides</h1>
<p>Lycopodium myosuroides, commonly known as the horse-tail clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched stems that are often covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear spores instead of flowers, a feature typical of ancient plant groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, reflecting its evolutionary history as a primitive vascular plant.</p>
