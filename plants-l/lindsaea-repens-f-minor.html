<p>Lindsaea repens f. minor, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are typically linear to ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged in a dense, carpet-like formation. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
