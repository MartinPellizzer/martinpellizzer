<p>Lasiospora eriophora, commonly known as the woolly moss or hairy lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. This lichen typically grows on tree bark, especially on conifers, in moist and shaded environments. Its thallus is crust-like and often forms a compact, foliose structure.</p>
<p>Lasiospora eriophora plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
