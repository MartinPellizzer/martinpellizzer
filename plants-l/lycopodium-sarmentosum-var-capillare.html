                    <h1>Lycopodium sarmentosum var. capillare</h1>
<p>Lycopodium sarmentosum var. capillare, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to moist, shaded environments in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, spiral clusters of spore-bearing structures called strobila at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are linear, pointed, and often crowded along the stems, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions and its ornamental appeal.</p>
