                <h1>Lophodium uliginosum</h1>
<p>Lophodium uliginosum, commonly known as the bog lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>It forms a thin, dark green to blackish crust on the substrate, often resembling a layer of moss. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
