                            <h1>Lithocarpus Arisanensis</h1>
<p>Lithocarpus arisanensis is a unique evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, though it is often mistaken for a type of stone栎 due to its hard, woody fruit. This species is known for its striking foliage and ecological importance in its native habitat. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure in global botanical discussions. Its conservation status highlights the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>
