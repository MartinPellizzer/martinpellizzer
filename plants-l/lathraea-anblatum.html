                    <h1>Lathraea anblatum</h1>
<p>Lathraea anblatum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a specialized root system that attaches to the roots of other plants, allowing it to absorb water and minerals. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rare and elusive nature, it is considered a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
