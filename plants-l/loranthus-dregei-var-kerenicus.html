                    <h1>Loranthus dregei var. kerenicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus dregei var. kerenicus, commonly known as the Kerenicus mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is native to southern Africa and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
