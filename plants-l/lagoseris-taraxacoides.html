<p>Lagoseris taraxacoides, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and resemble those of true dandelions.</p>
