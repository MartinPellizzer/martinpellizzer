                    <h1>Lathyrus hexaedrus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus hexaedrus, commonly known as the Greek grasspea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a climbing legume that produces small, pea-like flowers and cylindrical pods containing toxic seeds. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species. However, its seeds contain the neurotoxin Î²-N-oxalyl-L-amino acid (BOAA), which can cause neurological damage if consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>Due to this toxicity, it is considered a potential health hazard in certain agricultural contexts.</p>
