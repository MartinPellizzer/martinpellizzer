                    <h1>Linaria arabiniana</h1>
<p>Linaria arabiniana, commonly known as the desert snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Linaria arabiniana is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
