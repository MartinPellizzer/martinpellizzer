<p>Lolium multiflorum subsp.</p>
<p>gaudinii, commonly known as the Gaudini's ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is both a valuable forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
