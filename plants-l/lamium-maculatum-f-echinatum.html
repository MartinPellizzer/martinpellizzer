<p>Lamium maculatum f. echinatum, commonly known as the purple heart plant, is a decorative foliage plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically purple or reddish in color, with a contrasting white or cream border. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale purple or pink, appearing in clusters during the spring. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes primarily from its vibrant foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
