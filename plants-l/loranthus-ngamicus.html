                    <h1>Loranthus ngamicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ngamicus, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus ngamicus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
