                    <h1>Lotus australis f. subhirsuta</h1>
<p>Lotus australis f. subhirsuta, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features robust, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and also bear a similar hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
