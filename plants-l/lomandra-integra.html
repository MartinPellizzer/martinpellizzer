                    <h1>Lomandra integra</h1>
<p>Lomandra integra, commonly known as the common lomandra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and robust rhizomatous growth. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers in summer, followed by dark blue or black berries.</p>
<p>Lomandra integra is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils and is often used in native landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
