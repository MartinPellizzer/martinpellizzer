                    <h1>Lobivia haematantha subvar. elongata</h1>
<p>Lobivia haematantha subvar. elongata, commonly known as the Long-leaved Lobivia, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the growing season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardening.</p>
