                    <h1>Lepanthes panope</h1>
<p>Lepanthes panope, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with intricate patterns, which are often adorned with red or purple markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Lepanthes panope is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
