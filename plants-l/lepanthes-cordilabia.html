<p>Lepanthes cordilabia, commonly known as the heart-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a contrasting lip.

Its leaves are usually dark green and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Lepanthes cordilabia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
