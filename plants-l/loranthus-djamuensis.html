                    <h1>Loranthus djamuensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus djamuensis, commonly known as the Djamuensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches to its host tree, typically in the genus Ficus, through a specialized root system called a haustellum, which allows it to draw water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus djamuensis is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
