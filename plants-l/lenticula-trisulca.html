                    <h1>Lenticula trisulca</h1>
<p>Lenticula trisulca, commonly known as the three-ridged lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive three-ridged structure on its upper surface, which gives it its scientific name. The thallus is typically greenish to yellowish in color, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It forms dense mats on tree trunks and rocks, often in temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is an indicator species for air quality and ecological health in its habitat.</p>
