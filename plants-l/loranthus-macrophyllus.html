                    <h1>Loranthus macrophyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant's leaves are large, fleshy, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish, and its berries are red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest ecosystems where it plays a role in nutrient cycling.</p>
