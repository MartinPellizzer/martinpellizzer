<p>Leptopus adiantoides, commonly known as the feather-fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green color and a soft, leathery texture.</p>
