                    <h1>Lepicephalus brevipaleus</h1>
<p>Lepicephalus brevipaleus, commonly known as the short-pale leafy spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils and harsh environments.</p>
<p>Lepicephalus brevipaleus is often considered an invasive species in areas where it is not native, due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
