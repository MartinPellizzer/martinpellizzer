<p>Lemna aequinoctialis, commonly known as the floating heart, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its high growth rate, it can significantly impact water ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
