                    <h1>Lepisorus intermedius</h1>
<p>Lepisorus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across suitable substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species.</p>
