                    <h1>Ledum latifolium</h1>
<p>Ledum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf cowberry, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that typically thrives in moist, acidic soils found in boreal and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red berries that are edible for wildlife but toxic to humans. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its medicinal uses by indigenous peoples, though its toxicity requires caution in handling.</p>
