<p>Lepismium pacheco-leonis, commonly known as the Pacheco's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and unique, ghost-like flowers that are typically pale green or white with intricate veining. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly specialized, often opening at night, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
