                    <h1>Lazarum nudibaccatum</h1>
<p>Lazarum nudibaccatum, commonly known as the naked leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus that lacks distinct lobes, giving it a smooth and delicate appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
