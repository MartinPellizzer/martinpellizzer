                    <h1>Loncomelos visianicum</h1>
<p>Loncomelos visianicum, commonly known as the Visianic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and toxic compounds, it plays a complex role in its ecosystem, both as a plant and a potential hazard to livestock and humans.</p>
