                    <h1>Lobaria orientalis</h1>
<p>Lobaria orientalis, commonly known as the orange lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive orange to reddish-brown thallus, which is often covered in a layer of fine, branched hairs. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, specifically a member of the genus *Lobaria*. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in nutrient cycling and its use in ecological assessments of air quality.</p>
