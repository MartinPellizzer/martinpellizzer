                    <h1>Loranthus filifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus filifolius, commonly known as the filifoliate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
