<p>Lithocardium perrottetii, commonly known as the Cape sugarbush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and fragrant, white flowers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp.</p>
<p>Lithocardium perrottetii is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
