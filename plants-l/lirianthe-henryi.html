<p>Lirianthe henryi, commonly known as Henry's lirianthe, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique blend of white and purple hues. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lirianthe henryi is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
