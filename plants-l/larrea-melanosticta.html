<p>Larrea melanosticta, commonly known as greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-gray leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its stems are often covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Larrea melanosticta plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
