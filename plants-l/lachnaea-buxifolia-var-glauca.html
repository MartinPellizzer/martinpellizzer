                    <h1>Lachnaea buxifolia var. glauca</h1>
<p>Lachnaea buxifolia var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous boxleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive bluish-gray coating on its upper surface.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, particularly in humid, shaded environments. The plant's thallus is leathery and has a dense, compact structure with a prominent, leaf-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including apothecia, are usually embedded within the thallus.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
