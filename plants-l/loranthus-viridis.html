                    <h1>Loranthus viridis</h1>
<p>Loranthus viridis, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fagaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often inconspicuous, and its berries are typically red or yellow, containing sticky seeds that aid in dispersal by birds. Loranthus viridis is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, growing in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategies make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
