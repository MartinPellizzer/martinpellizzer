                    <h1>Lastrea diaphana</h1>
<p>Lastrea diaphana, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lastrea diaphana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
