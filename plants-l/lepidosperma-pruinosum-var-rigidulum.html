                    <h1>Lepidosperma pruinosum var. rigidulum</h1>
<p>Lepidosperma pruinosum var. rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid-leaved swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, narrow leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in wetland environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist or submerged soils, typically found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
