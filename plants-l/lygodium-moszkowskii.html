<p>Lygodium moszkowskii, commonly known as the Moskowii climbing fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, flexible fronds that can reach several meters in length. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist, shaded environments.</p>
