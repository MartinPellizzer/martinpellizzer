                    <h1>Liparis kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Liparis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in the cool, moist, and shaded environments of the mountain's cloud forests, often growing on moss-covered tree trunks or rocks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
