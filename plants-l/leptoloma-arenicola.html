                    <h1>Leptoloma arenicola</h1>
<p>Leptoloma arenicola, commonly known as the sandhill puffball, is a small, non-photosynthetic fungus that forms symbiotic relationships with certain plants.</p>
<p>It is typically found in sandy soils, often associated with grasses and other low-growing vegetation. The fungus produces a distinctive, white, spherical fruiting body that becomes dry and brittle as it matures. It plays a role in nutrient cycling by decomposing organic matter in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized environment, it is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive.</p>
