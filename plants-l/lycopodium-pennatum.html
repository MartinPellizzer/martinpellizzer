<p>Lycopodium pennatum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a species of clubmoss that belongs to the family Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that give it a pine-like appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophytes are often found in dense clusters on the ground.</p>
<p>Lycopodium pennatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions.</p>
