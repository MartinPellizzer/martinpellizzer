<p>Lamottea arenosa, commonly known as the sand lamottea, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lamottea arenosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to flourish in harsh environments.</p>
