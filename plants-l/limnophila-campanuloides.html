<p>Limnophila campanuloides, commonly known as the water bellflower, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic settings. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in shallow water habitats.</p>
<p>Limnophila campanuloides plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
