<p>Lachnaea elsieae, commonly known as the Elsie's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lachnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crust-like growth form and is typically found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, and it lacks distinct lobes or rhizines. It is a relatively rare and specialized lichen, often growing in specific microhabitats with particular substrate and climate conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to lichenologists and conservationists.</p>
