                    <h1>Lemna arrhiza</h1>
<p>Lemna arrhiza, commonly known as the water velvet, is a small, floating aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family.</p>
<p>It has tiny, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to the water surface. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Lemna arrhiza is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
