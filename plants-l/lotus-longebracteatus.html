                    <h1>Lotus longebracteatus</h1>
<p>Lotus longebracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces striking pink or purple flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often submerged, helping to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Lotus longebracteatus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
