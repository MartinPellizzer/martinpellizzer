<p>Lotus involucratus, commonly known as the white lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking white flowers that bloom in late summer, often floating on the water's surface. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
