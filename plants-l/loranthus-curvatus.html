                    <h1>Loranthus curvatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus curvatus, commonly known as the curved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive, elongated, and often curved stem with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, and it produces fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Australia and is known for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
