                    <h1>Lonchocarpus ehrenbergii</h1>
<p>Lonchocarpus ehrenbergii, commonly known as the yellow cowpea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces woody pods containing small, edible seeds that are rich in protein. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems.</p>
