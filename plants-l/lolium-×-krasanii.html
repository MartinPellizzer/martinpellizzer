                    <h1>Lolium × krasanii</h1>
<p>Lolium × krasanii, commonly known as the hybrid ryegrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Lolium perenne and Lolium multiflorum.</p>
<p>It is notable for its rapid establishment and dense growth habit, making it a valuable forage crop in agricultural settings. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Lolium × krasanii is often used in pasture and turfgrass management for its resilience and productivity.</p>
