                    <h1>Lellingeria organensis</h1>
<p>Lellingeria organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
