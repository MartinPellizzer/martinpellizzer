                    <h1>Lemurella sarcanthoides</h1>
<p>Lemurella sarcanthoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are usually small and waxy, adapted to conserve water in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Lemurella sarcanthoides is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
