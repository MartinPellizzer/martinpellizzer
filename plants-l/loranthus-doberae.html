                    <h1>Loranthus doberae</h1>
<p>Loranthus doberae, commonly known as the Dobera mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus doberae is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is considered a significant component of the ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
