<p>Lamprococcus warasii, commonly known as the Warasii scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, flattened body covered in a waxy, protective shield. The plant it infests is typically a member of the family Rubiaceae, such as certain species of shrubs and vines. The insect feeds on the sap of its host plant, which can lead to weakened growth and yellowing of leaves.</p>
<p>Its presence is often detected by the honeydew it excretes, which can attract sooty mold.</p>
