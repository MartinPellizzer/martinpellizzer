                    <h1>Lahaya aristata</h1>
<p>Lahaya aristata, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lahaya aristata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and ecological benefits make it a valuable plant in desert landscapes.</p>
