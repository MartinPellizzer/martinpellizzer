                    <h1>Loranthus mangheensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus mangheensis, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria, while it also performs photosynthesis. It typically produces small, fleshy berries that are red or orange in color, which serve as a food source for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range.</p>
