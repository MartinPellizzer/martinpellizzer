                    <h1>Latania glaucophylla</h1>
<p>Latania glaucophylla, commonly known as the silver-leafed palm, is a striking evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dune environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare in the wild and requires specific conditions to grow successfully.</p>
