                    <h1>Lepidophyllum teretiusculum</h1>
<p>Lepidophyllum teretiusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, contributing to its unique appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by fleshy, red berries that are attractive to birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in arid environments and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
