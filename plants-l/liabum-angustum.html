<p>Liabum angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>Liabum angustum is typically found in moist to wet habitats, including swamps and along stream banks.</p>
