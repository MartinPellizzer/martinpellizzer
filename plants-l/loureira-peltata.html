<p>Loureira peltata, commonly known as the broadleaf lily or velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellowish throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
