                    <h1>Lantana camara var. flava</h1>
<p>Lantana camara var. flava, commonly known as yellow lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically green with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
