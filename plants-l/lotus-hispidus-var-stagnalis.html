                    <h1>Lotus hispidus var. stagnalis</h1>
<p>Lotus hispidus var. stagnalis, commonly known as the hairy water lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has broad, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and provide buoyancy. Its showy pink or white flowers bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The roots of this species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
