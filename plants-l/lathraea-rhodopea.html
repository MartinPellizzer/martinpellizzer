                    <h1>Lathraea rhodopea</h1>
<p>Lathraea rhodopea, commonly known as the Greek flame flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a vivid splash of color to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Lathraea rhodopea is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for various ailments.</p>
