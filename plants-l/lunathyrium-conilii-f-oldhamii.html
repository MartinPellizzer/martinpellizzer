                    <h1>Lunathyrium conilii f. oldhamii</h1>
<p>Lunathyrium conilii f. oldhamii, commonly known as the Oldham's sea holly, is a rare and striking coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-blue, spoon-shaped leaves and striking, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It is often found in dunes and along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
