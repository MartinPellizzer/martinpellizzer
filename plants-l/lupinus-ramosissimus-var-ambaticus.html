                    <h1>Lupinus ramosissimus var. ambaticus</h1>
<p>Lupinus ramosissimus var. ambaticus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
