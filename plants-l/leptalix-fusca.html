                    <h1>Leptalix fusca</h1>
<p>Leptalix fusca, commonly known as the dark leathery lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus and a complex structure composed of fungal and algal components. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator species for ecological health.</p>
