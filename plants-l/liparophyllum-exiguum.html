                    <h1>Liparophyllum exiguum</h1>
<p>Liparophyllum exiguum, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, coastal environments and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
