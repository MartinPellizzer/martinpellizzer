                    <h1>Lathraea japonica var. miqueliana</h1>
<p>Lathraea japonica var. miqueliana, commonly known as the Japanese ghost flower, is a rare and unique parasitic plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are specialized to attach to the roots of other plants, often grasses or shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
