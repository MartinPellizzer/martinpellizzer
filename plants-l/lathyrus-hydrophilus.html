<p>Lathyrus hydrophilus, commonly known as water pea, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Lathyrus hydrophilus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
