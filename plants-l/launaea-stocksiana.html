                    <h1>Launaea stocksiana</h1>
<p>Launaea stocksiana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a hairy, succulent stem and leaves that are often lobed or divided, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Launaea stocksiana is well-suited to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
