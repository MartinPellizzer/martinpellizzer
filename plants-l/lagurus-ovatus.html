<p>Lagurus ovatus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, yellow flower heads that resemble a goat’s beard, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a soft, hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Lagurus ovatus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks, where it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators.</p>
