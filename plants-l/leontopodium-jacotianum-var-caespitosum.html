                    <h1>Leontopodium jacotianum var. caespitosum</h1>
<p>Leontopodium jacotianum var. caespitosum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale green foliage and its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Its unique morphology helps it retain heat and reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its beauty and ecological significance, it is a symbol of the Alps and is protected in many regions.</p>
