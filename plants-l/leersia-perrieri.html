<p>Leersia perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Leersia perrieri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
