                            <h1>Linaria Elatine Var. Commutata</h1>
<p>Yellow sandwort, scientifically known as Linaria elatine var. commutata, is a resilient and striking plant that thrives in harsh environments. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils where few other plants can survive. Its bright yellow flowers, which resemble small daisies, bloom in late spring and early summer, adding a splash of color to its arid surroundings. The plant's unique adaptations, including its deep root system and hairy leaves, help it conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures. Despite its tough conditions, Yellow sandwort plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
