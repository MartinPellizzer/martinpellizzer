                    <h1>Lomariocycas insularis</h1>
<p>Lomariocycas insularis, commonly known as the island cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of La RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
