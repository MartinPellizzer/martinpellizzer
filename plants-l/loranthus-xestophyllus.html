                    <h1>Loranthus xestophyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus xestophyllus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, such as oaks and apple trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that contain seeds. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategy make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
