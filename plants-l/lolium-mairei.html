                    <h1>Lolium mairei</h1>
<p>Lolium mairei, commonly known as the Maire's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, greenish-blue leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Lolium mairei thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it is primarily valued for its ecological role in mountain ecosystems.</p>
