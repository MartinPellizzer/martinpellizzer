<p>Leptinella traillii subsp.</p>
<p>pulchella, commonly known as the Alpine Snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to rocky habitats. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
