                    <h1>Lacmellea arborescens var. muelleri</h1>
<p>Lacmellea arborescens var. muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's tree moss, is a rare and unique species of liverwort.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, tree-like growth form, which is unusual for liverworts. The plant has a dense, cushion-like structure with closely packed, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological significance in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
