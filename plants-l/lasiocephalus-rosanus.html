                    <h1>Lasiocephalus rosanus</h1>
<p>Lasiocephalus rosanus, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock heath, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available.</p>
