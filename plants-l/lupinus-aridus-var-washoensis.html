<p>Lupinus aridus var. washoensis, commonly known as the Wasatch lupine, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>

The plant features upright stems with clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
