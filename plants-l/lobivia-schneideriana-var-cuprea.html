                    <h1>Lobivia schneideriana var. cuprea</h1>
<p>Lobivia schneideriana var. cuprea, commonly known as the Copper Lobivia, is a compact, flowering cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white or silver hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its grey-green foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique coloration and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
