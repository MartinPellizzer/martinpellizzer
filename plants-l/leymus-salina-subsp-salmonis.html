<p>Leymus salina subsp.</p>
<p>salmonis, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and its ability to thrive in high-salt conditions.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dense, low mats, often forming a dominant vegetation type in salt marshes and dunes. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation across coastal regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a crucial role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
