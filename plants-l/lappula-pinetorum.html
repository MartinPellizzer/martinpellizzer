<p>Lappula pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest lappula, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. This species is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils within pine woodlands and open forests. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Lappula pinetorum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivorous insects.</p>
