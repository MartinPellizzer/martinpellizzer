<p>Lasiocladus anthospermifolius var. anthospermifolius, commonly known as the desert flax, is a shrub-like plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is a member of the Ephedraceae family, which includes plants adapted to harsh, dry climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptations to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
