<p>Leea solomonensis, commonly known as Solomon's leeah, is a flowering plant native to the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically found at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments within its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research.</p>
