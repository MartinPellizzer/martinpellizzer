                    <h1>Loranthus cupulatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus cupulatus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus cupulatus is often found in temperate regions and can be a significant parasite on various hardwood trees.</p>
