                    <h1>Loranthus brideliae</h1>
<p>Loranthus brideliae, commonly known as the Bridel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its roots.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The plant has broad, ovate leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth and health of its host trees if not managed.</p>
