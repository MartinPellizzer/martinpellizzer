                    <h1>Lucilia subspicata</h1>
<p>Lucilia subspicata, commonly known as the green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive, elongated abdominal segments. The plant-like appearance of its larvae, which are often found in decaying organic matter, has led to its association with certain plant-based environments. While not a true plant, it plays a role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable substrates for egg-laying and larval development.</p>
