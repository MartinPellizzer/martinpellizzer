                    <h1>Lepidocoryphantha</h1>
<p>Lepidocoryphantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lepidocoryphantha is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary strategies for thriving in desert conditions.</p>
