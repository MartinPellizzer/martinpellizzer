                    <h1>Leptogonum</h1>
<p>Leptogonum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly the Andes region. The plants typically have basal leaves that are silver-gray due to dense pubescence, and they produce small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. Leptogonum species are often found in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their attractive foliage and flowering habits.</p>
