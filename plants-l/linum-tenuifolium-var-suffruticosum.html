                    <h1>Linum tenuifolium var. suffruticosum</h1>
<p>Linum tenuifolium var. suffruticosum, commonly known as creeping flax, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense ground cover. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically less than 1 inch in width, and the plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stems and leaves have been historically used for textile production and as a source of linseed oil.</p>
