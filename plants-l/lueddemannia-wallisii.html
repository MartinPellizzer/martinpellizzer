                    <h1>Lueddemannia wallisii</h1>
<p>Lueddemannia wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's lichen, is a species of foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green to pale green thallus with a finely granular texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga, and a fungal component, usually a member of the Ascomycota. It is typically found growing on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Lueddemannia wallisii is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
