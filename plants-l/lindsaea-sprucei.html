<p>Lindsaea sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant in the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern ally that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a prostrate or erect growth habit, with slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches.</p>
<p>Lindsaea sprucei is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
