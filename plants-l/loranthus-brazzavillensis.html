                    <h1>Loranthus brazzavillensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus brazzavillensis, commonly known as the Central African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting various wildlife species.</p>
