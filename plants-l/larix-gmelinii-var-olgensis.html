                    <h1>Larix gmelinii var. olgensis</h1>
<p>Larix gmelinii var. olgensis, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a variant of the Siberian larch native to eastern Siberia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves in the fall, making it unique among larch species. The tree has a slender, conical shape with a smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This hardy species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in taiga and tundra regions.</p>
