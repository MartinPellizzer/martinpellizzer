                    <h1>Lunellia</h1>
<p>Lunellia, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Lunellia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to the plant's reproductive strategy.</p>
