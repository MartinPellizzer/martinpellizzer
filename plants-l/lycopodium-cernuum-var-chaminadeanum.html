<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like clusters on the ground. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically reddish-brown and clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
