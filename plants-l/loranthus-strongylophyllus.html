                    <h1>Loranthus strongylophyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus strongylophyllus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalypts.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in pairs, and it produces small, white or yellow flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are red and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in supporting native wildlife and maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
