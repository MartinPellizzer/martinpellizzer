<p>Lissochilus subintegris, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lissochilus subintegris is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
