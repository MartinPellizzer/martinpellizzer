<p>Loranthus variifolius, commonly known as the variable leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found on species such as acacia and eucalyptus. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain sticky seeds. Its leaves are usually alternate and vary in shape, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Loranthus variifolius plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
