<p>Leioligo, commonly known as the lace fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid environments. Its leaves are usually light green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>Leioligo thrives in shady, moist conditions and is often found in rainforests.</p>
