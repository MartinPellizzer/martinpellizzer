                    <h1>Leptocarpus distachyos</h1>
<p>Leptocarpus distachyos, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces distinctive, two-flowered fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to tolerate and even benefit from high salinity levels.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
