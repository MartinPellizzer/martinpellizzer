                    <h1>Loranthus quercicola</h1>
<p>Loranthus quercicola, commonly known as the oak dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to oak trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots, leaves, and stems, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can germinate on the bark of suitable host trees.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Asia and is an example of a hemiparasitic plant that can weaken its host over time.</p>
