                    <h1>Lupinus tatei</h1>
<p>Lupinus tatei, commonly known as the Kauai lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has small, compound leaves and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Lupinus tatei plays an important ecological role in its environment, providing nectar for native pollinators and contributing to soil nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
