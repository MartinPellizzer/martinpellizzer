                    <h1>Leucheria cerberoana</h1>
<p>Leucheria cerberoana, commonly known as the Cerberus lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species that thrives in specific, often harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to its substrate. The lichen's symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi is essential for its survival, allowing it to colonize rocky and barren surfaces. Its distribution is limited to certain regions, making it a subject of interest for botanical and ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is often used as an indicator of environmental health and stability.</p>
