                    <h1>Loxogramme macrophylla</h1>
<p>Loxogramme macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf water clover, is a member of the water fern family, Salviniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, delicate fronds that are divided into small, spoon-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are absent, and it anchors itself using rootless rhizomes that spread along the water's surface.</p>
<p>Loxogramme macrophylla plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
