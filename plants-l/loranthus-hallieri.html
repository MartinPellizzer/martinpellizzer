                    <h1>Loranthus hallieri</h1>
<p>Loranthus hallieri, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and has a unique symbiotic relationship with its host, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters, thriving in temperate and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
