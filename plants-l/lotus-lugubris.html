                    <h1>Lotus lugubris</h1>
<p>Lotus lugubris, commonly known as the mourning lotus, is a rare and enigmatic aquatic plant found in the marshes and wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrate, and it plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Lotus lugubris is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
