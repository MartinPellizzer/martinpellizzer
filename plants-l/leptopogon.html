<p>Leptopogon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in temperate regions, often in alpine or subalpine environments. They are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, tussock-forming growth habit. Leptopogon species are often adapted to harsh climates, with some exhibiting cold tolerance and resistance to drought.</p>
<p>Their ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
