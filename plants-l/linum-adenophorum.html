                    <h1>Linum adenophorum</h1>
<p>Linum adenophorum, commonly known as the woolly flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous stalks have been used traditionally for cordage and textiles, similar to other flax species.</p>
<p>Linum adenophorum is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
