<p>Liparia, commonly known as the "buttercup grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and often have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. They are typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Liparia species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which is a common trait among members of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Their ecological importance includes supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization in their native environments.</p>
