                    <h1>Lycopodium alopecuroides f. polyclavatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium alopecuroides f. polyclavatum, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a rare fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
