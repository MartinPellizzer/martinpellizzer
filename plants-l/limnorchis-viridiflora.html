                    <h1>Limnorchis viridiflora</h1>
<p>Limnorchis viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered water orchid, is a striking aquatic plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to aquatic life and its role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
