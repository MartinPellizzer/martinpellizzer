                    <h1>Lotus balticus</h1>
<p>Lotus balticus, commonly known as the Baltic lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, contributing to water purification.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and pollution, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
