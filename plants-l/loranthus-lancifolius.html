                    <h1>Loranthus lancifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some sugars through photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
