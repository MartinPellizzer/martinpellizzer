<p>Lysianthius, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in dry, arid environments. Lysianthius species are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often resemble small lanterns, with vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The flowers are typically tubular and clustered in inflorescences, which attract pollinators like birds and insects.</p>
