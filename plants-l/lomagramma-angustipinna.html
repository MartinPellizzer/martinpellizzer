                    <h1>Lomagramma angustipinna</h1>
<p>Lomagramma angustipinna, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lomagramma, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it attaches to tree bark or rock surfaces. Its small, clustered sporangia are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
