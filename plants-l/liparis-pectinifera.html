<p>Liparis pectinifera, commonly known as the hairy lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
