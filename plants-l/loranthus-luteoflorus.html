                    <h1>Loranthus luteoflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus luteoflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
