The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Loeseneriella urceolus is often found in nutrient-rich habitats and is considered an indicator species for certain water conditions.</p>
