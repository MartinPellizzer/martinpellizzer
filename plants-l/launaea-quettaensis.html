<p>Launaea quettaensis, commonly known as the Quetta dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant has a rosette-forming habit with silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Launaea quettaensis is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky habitats.</p>
