<p>Linosyris repens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Linosyris repens is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
