                    <h1>Lycium elliotii</h1>
<p>Lycium elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Lycium elliotii is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
