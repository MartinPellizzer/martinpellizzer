                    <h1>Linum flexuosum</h1>
<p>Linum flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its fibrous stems were historically used for fiber production, similar to other flax species, though it is less commercially valuable than Linum usitatissimum.</p>
<p>Linum flexuosum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environment.</p>
