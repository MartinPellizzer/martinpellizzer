<p>Lepisorus nigripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome that supports the growth of its leafy structures. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Lepisorus nigripes is often found in slow-moving streams and marshy areas, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics.</p>
