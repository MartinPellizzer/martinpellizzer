<p>Lipocarpha kernii, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters.
