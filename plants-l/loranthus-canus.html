                    <h1>Loranthus canus</h1>
<p>Loranthus canus, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
