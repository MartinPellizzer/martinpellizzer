                    <h1>Lycopodium verticillatum var. apertum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium verticillatum var. apertum, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems, a feature that distinguishes it from other clubmoss species. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation.</p>
