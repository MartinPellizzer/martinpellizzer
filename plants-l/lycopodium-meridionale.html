                    <h1>Lycopodium meridionale</h1>
<p>Lycopodium meridionale, commonly known as the southern clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves. Native to regions of southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of ancient plant groups.</p>
<p>Its structure and physiology reflect its evolutionary history as a primitive vascular plant.</p>
