                    <h1>Ledebouria coriacea</h1>
<p>Ledebouria coriacea, commonly known as the hard-leaved bulbous plant, is a species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the warmer months. It is typically grown as a succulent due to its ability to store water in its bulbous base.</p>
<p>Ledebouria coriacea is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscapes.</p>
