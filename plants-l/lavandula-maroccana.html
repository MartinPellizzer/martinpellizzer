                    <h1>Lavandula maroccana</h1>
<p>Lavandula maroccana, commonly known as Moroccan lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, spike-like flower clusters that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, extracted from the flowers, are valued for their fragrance and use in aromatherapy and perfumery.</p>
