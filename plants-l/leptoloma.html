                    <h1>Leptoloma</h1>
<p>Leptoloma, commonly known as the ghost mushroom, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are typically found in forested areas, where they form symbiotic relationships with the roots of various trees. Leptoloma species are characterized by their delicate, often translucent caps and slender stems. They are saprophytic, decomposing organic matter in the soil and contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to their subtle appearance, they are often mistaken for other similar-looking mushrooms, making accurate identification challenging.</p>
