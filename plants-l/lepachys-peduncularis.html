<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal.</p>
<p>Lepachys peduncularis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
