<p>Lycopodioides mittenii, commonly known as the Mitten's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Native to the moist, shaded environments of the Pacific Northwest, it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect sunlight.</p>
