                    <h1>Limnorchis saccata</h1>
<p>Limnorchis saccata, commonly known as the sac-like liver fluke, is a parasitic trematode that primarily infects the liver of various mammals, including humans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fasciolidae and is characterized by its distinctive, sac-like body shape. The adult fluke attaches to the bile ducts using a muscular oral sucker and a ventral sucker. Its life cycle involves intermediate hosts such as snails and freshwater crustaceans, before reaching the definitive host.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of its body has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant but a parasitic flatworm.</p>
