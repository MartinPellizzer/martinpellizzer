                    <h1>Loranthus gjellerupii</h1>
<p>Loranthus gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant has a distinctive, flattened, disc-like shape with small, scale-like leaves and white or pale green berries. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
