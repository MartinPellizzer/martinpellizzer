                    <h1>Lemna oblonga</h1>
<p>Lemna oblonga, commonly known as the broad waternymph, is a small, floating aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae).</p>
<p>It has simple, oval-shaped leaves that are typically 3â€“8 mm in length and lack true roots, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with new shoots forming at the nodes of the existing fronds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its fast growth rate, it can form dense mats on the water surface, impacting water quality and light penetration.</p>
