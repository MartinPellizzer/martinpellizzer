<p>Lathyrus nivalis subsp.</p>
<p>sahinii, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
