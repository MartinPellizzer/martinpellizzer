                    <h1>Lycopodium verticillatum var. filiforme</h1>
<p>Lycopodium verticillatum var. filiforme, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its finely branched, thread-like leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to regions of North America, particularly in forested areas with moist, well-drained soil. The plant forms dense mats close to the ground, with sporophylls arranged in whorls around the central axis. Its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures are typical of the clubmosses, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slender, filamentous foliage compared to other varieties of Lycopodium verticillatum.</p>
