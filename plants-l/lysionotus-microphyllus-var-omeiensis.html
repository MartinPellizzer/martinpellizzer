<p>Lysionotus microphyllus var. omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei Mountain star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
