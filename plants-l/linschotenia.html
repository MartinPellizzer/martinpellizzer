                    <h1>Linschotenia</h1>
<p>Linschotenia, commonly known as the "buttercup lichen," is a type of foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which often has a distinctive central umbilicate structure. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, Linschotenia is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
