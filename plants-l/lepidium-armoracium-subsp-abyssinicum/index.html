                            <h1>Lepidium Armoracium Subsp. Abyssinicum</h1>
<p>Abyssinian cress, scientifically known as Lepidium armoracium subsp. abyssinicum, is a small yet resilient plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. This member of the Brassicaceae family is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and tiny yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high altitudes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it has become a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
