                    <h1>Lannea grandis</h1>
<p>Lannea grandis, commonly known as the African wild rubber tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree's bark is thick and fissured, providing a natural defense against herbivores. Lannea grandis is also notable for its ability to produce latex, similar to rubber trees, though it is less commercially exploited.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for various wildlife species.</p>
