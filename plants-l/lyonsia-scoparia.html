<p>Lyonsia scoparia, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lyonsia scoparia is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powder that helps reduce water loss and protect against UV radiation.</p>
