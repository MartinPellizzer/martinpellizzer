                    <h1>Lychnodiscus reticulatus</h1>
<p>Lychnodiscus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers with intricate net-like venation on its petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
