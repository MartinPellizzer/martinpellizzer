                    <h1>Leucheria glacialis var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Leucheria glacialis var. longifolia, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. This variety is distinguished by its longer leaves compared to the typical form, which contributes to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
