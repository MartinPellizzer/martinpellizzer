<p>Lycopodium dichotomum subsp.</p>
<p>mollicomum, commonly known as the soft-fruited clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern. It produces small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral along the stems.</p>
<p>The plant bears sporangia in clusters at the tips of the branches, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its soft, fleshy sporophylls, distinguishing it from other members of the genus.</p>
