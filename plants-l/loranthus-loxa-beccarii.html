                    <h1>Loranthus loxa-beccarii</h1>
<p>Loranthus loxa-beccarii, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable component of its native forest ecosystems.</p>
