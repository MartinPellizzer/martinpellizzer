                    <h1>Loranthus granularis</h1>
<p>Loranthus granularis, commonly known as the rough mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its hemiparasitic relationship with its host. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus granularis is found in various parts of Asia and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
