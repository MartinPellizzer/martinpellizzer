                    <h1>Lathyrus prostratus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate pea, is a low-growing annual legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which are typically borne in clusters. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Lathyrus prostratus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
