<p>Luffa hederacea, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, hairy leaves and elongated, ridged fruits that mature to a light green or yellowish color. The plant produces both male and female flowers, with the female flowers developing into the edible or fibrous fruit depending on cultivation practices. The fruit's inner cavity becomes spongy and fibrous when mature, making it useful for scrubbing or as a natural sponge.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun and well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
