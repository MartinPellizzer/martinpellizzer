                    <h1>Lomatium tracyi</h1>
<p>Lomatium tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's lomatium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to persist through harsh environmental conditions, and it is often found in areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Lomatium tracyi is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use by Indigenous peoples.</p>
