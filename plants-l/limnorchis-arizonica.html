<p>Limnorchis arizonica, commonly known as Arizona marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and riparian zones, where it relies on consistent moisture. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive spurred structure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Limnorchis arizonica is considered endangered and is protected in several states.</p>
