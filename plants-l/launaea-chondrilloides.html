<p>Launaea chondrilloides, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Launaea chondrilloides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
