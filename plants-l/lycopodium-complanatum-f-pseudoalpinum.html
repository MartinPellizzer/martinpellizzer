                    <h1>Lycopodium complanatum f. pseudoalpinum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium complanatum f. pseudoalpinum, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a rare and low-growing fern ally native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a dense, mat-forming structure with small, scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change.</p>
