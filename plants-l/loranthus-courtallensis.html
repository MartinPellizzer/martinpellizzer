                    <h1>Loranthus courtallensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus courtallensis, commonly known as the Courtallense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its fruit is a globose capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
