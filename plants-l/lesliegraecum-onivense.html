<p>Lesliegraecum onivense, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blossoms that bloom in the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in the shaded, humid environment of the canopy. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help in nutrient absorption from the nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Lesliegraecum onivense is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts.</p>
