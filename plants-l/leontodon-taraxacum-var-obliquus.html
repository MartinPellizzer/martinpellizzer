<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that curve outward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, hollow seed stalks. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
