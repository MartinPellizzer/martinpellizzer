                    <h1>Leptochilus ovatus</h1>
<p>Leptochilus ovatus, commonly known as the oval-leaved liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to the substrate. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in specialized leaf-like structures called gametophores.</p>
<p>Leptochilus ovatus is typically found on damp rocks or soil in temperate regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of moss and liverwort communities.</p>
