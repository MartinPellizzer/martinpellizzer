                    <h1>Lilium leichtlinii var. majus</h1>
<p>Lilium leichtlinii var. majus, commonly known as the giant white lily, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and southern Siberia. This variety is distinguished by its large, white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
