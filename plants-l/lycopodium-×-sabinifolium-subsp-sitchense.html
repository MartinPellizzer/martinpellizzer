<p>Lycopodium × sabinifolium subsp.</p>
<p>sitchense, commonly known as the Sichuan clubmoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally native to China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves that form a dense, compact rosette.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, a feature typical of the Lycopodiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
