<p>Lecythis corrugata subsp.</p>
<p>rosea, commonly known as the rosewood or red lecythis, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The tree produces yellowish flowers followed by large, woody fruits that split open to reveal edible seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
