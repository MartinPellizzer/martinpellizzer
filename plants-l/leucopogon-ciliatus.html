<p>Leucopogon ciliatus, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Leucopogon ciliatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
