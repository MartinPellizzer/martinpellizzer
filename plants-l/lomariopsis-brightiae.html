<p>Lomariopsis brightiae, commonly known as the Bright's lomariopsis, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Lomariopsis brightiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
