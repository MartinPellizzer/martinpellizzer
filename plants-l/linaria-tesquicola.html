                    <h1>Linaria tesquicola</h1>
<p>Linaria tesquicola, commonly known as the desert toadflax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Linaria tesquicola thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom from spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
