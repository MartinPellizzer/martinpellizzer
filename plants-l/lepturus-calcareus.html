                    <h1>Lepturus calcareus</h1>
<p>Lepturus calcareus, commonly known as the limestone lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in calcareous (limestone) environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, crust-like growths on rock surfaces, often in temperate and subarctic regions. The lichen consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which together perform photosynthesis. Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor, alkaline soils makes it an indicator species for calcium-rich substrates.</p>
<p>The plant's slow growth and long lifespan contribute to its ecological significance in stable, undisturbed habitats.</p>
