                    <h1>Lycopodium monosporum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium monosporum, commonly known as the narrowleaf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, erect, branching stems that are typically less than 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces microphylls, which are small, simple leaves that lack veins, a defining feature of the lycophytes. Lycopodium monosporum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, releasing them from sporangia that are clustered in strobila.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors, where it contributes to the understory vegetation.</p>
