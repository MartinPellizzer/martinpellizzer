                    <h1>Lycopersicon pennellii var. puberulum</h1>
<p>Lycopersicon pennellii var. puberulum, commonly known as the hairy wild tomato, is a wild relative of the domesticated tomato.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a distinguishing feature from other tomato species. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are not typically consumed by humans but are valuable in genetic research.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity makes it an important resource for breeding programs aimed at improving tomato resilience and yield.</p>
