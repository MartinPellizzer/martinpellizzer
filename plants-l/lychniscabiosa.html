                    <h1>Lychniscabiosa</h1>
<p>Lychniscabiosa, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its succulent leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Lychniscabiosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
