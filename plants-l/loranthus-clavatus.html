                    <h1>Loranthus clavatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus clavatus, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced foliage and a reliance on host plants for survival.</p>
