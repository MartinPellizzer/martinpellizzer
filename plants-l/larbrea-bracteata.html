<p>Larbrea bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
