                    <h1>Lasiandra strigillosa</h1>
<p>Lasiandra strigillosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to penetrate the host's vascular system and extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating further colonization.</p>
