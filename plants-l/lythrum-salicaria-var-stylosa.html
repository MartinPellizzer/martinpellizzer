                    <h1>Lythrum salicaria var. stylosa</h1>
<p>Lythrum salicaria var. stylosa, commonly known as narrow-leaved rosebay, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of showy pink to purple flowers. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical rosebay but shares similar ecological roles and ornamental value.</p>
