                    <h1>Loranthus kerberi</h1>
<p>Loranthus kerberi, commonly known as the Kerberâ€™s mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus kerberi is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
