<p>Luzula sylvatica f. olympica, commonly known as the Olympic sedge, is a striking ornamental grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its dense, upright clumps of bright green, grass-like foliage that often turns coppery red in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are followed by clusters of dark blue berries.</p>
<p>Its unique coloration and graceful form make it a popular choice for adding texture and visual interest to shaded landscapes.</p>
