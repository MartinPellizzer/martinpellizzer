                    <h1>Limonium subglabrum</h1>
<p>Limonium subglabrum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, spike-like flower heads composed of numerous small blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the subspecies subglabrum is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Limonium subglabrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions.</p>
