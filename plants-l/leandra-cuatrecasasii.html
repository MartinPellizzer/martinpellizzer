                    <h1>Leandra cuatrecasasii</h1>
<p>Leandra cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's arum, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often white or pale green, with a strong, musky scent that attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
