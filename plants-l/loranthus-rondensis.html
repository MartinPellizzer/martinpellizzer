                    <h1>Loranthus rondensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus rondensis, commonly known as the Rond√¥nia mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in Brazil. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are typically visited by insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
