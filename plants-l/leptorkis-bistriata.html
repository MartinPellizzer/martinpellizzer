                    <h1>Leptorkis bistriata</h1>
<p>Leptorkis bistriata, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that display a distinctive two-toned pattern, typically with dark purple or brown markings on a lighter background. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Leptorkis bistriata is considered a conservation concern.</p>
