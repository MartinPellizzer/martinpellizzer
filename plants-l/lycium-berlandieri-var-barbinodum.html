<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals, though they contain toxic compounds in high quantities. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
