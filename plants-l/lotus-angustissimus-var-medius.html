                    <h1>Lotus angustissimus var. medius</h1>
<p>Lotus angustissimus var. medius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces striking white to pink flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in maintaining water quality in its native habitats.</p>
