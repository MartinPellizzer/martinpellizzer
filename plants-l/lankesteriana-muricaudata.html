<p>Lankesteriana muricaudata, commonly known as the hairy-tailed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hairy appendages on the base of its petals, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a contrasting green or yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
