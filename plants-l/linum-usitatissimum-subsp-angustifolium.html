<p>Linum usitatissimum subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved flax, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, angular stems and lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the common flax.</p>
<p>The plant produces blue or violet flowers in racemes, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its fibrous stalks are used for fiber production, similar to common flax, though it is less economically significant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its historical use in textile and oil production.</p>
