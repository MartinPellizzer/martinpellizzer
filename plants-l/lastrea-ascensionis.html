                    <h1>Lastrea ascensionis</h1>
<p>Lastrea ascensionis, commonly known as the Ascension Island liverwort, is a unique moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It thrives in the arid and rocky environments of Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. This plant is characterized by its small, tightly packed leaves and a lack of true stems, typical of many liverworts. It plays a vital role in stabilizing the soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
