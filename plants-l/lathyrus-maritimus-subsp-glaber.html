<p>Lathyrus maritimus subsp.</p>
<p>glaber, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple.</p>
<p>The plant has pinnately compound leaves with stipules, and its root system is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion due to its extensive root network.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
