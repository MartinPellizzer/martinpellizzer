                    <h1>Lotus repens</h1>
<p>Lotus repens, commonly known as the water lentil, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, while its leaves are broad and flat, forming a floating mat on the water's surface. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in shallow water, and its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas. Lotus repens is known for its ability to purify water by absorbing nutrients and heavy metals.</p>
<p>It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
