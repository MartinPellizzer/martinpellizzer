<p>Lachnostoma gonoloboides, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms large, flat, leaf-like thalli.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, temperate forests. The lichen has a bright green to yellowish-green upper surface and a white to pale yellow lower surface. It is composed of a fungal partner and a cyanobacterial or algal partner, forming a mutualistic relationship.</p>
<p>This species is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
