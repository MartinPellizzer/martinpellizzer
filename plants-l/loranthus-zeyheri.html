                    <h1>Loranthus zeyheri</h1>
<p>Loranthus zeyheri, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats across southern Africa.</p>
