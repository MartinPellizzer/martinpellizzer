                    <h1>Lithops bromfieldii</h1>
<p>Lithops bromfieldii, commonly known as the "Pebble Plant," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its two fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, which help it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its thick, rounded leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Lithops bromfieldii is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
