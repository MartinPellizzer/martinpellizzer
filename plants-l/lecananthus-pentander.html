<p>Lecananthus pentander, commonly known as the broadleaf waterwheel, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged in water. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that helps it spread along the water's surface and substrate. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often floating on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Lecananthus pentander plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
