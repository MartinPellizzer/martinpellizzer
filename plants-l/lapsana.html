                    <h1>Lapsana</h1>
<p>Lapsana, commonly known as common cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender stems and small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Lapsana is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
