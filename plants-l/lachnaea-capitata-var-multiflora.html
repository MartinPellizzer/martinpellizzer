                    <h1>Lachnaea capitata var. multiflora</h1>
<p>Lachnaea capitata var. multiflora, commonly known as the clustered lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dense, cushion-like growth form with a dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, granular underside. The thallus is composed of a complex network of hyphae, with specialized structures for absorbing nutrients from the substrate. It often grows on tree bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is notable for its ability to form dense clusters, which provide habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
