                    <h1>Limnas</h1>
<p>Limnas, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, waterborne flowers that are typically white or pink, with petals that open during the day. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems support the foliage above the water.</p>
<p>Limnas plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
