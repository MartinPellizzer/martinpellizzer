                    <h1>Limonium cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Limonium cuspidatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. Limonium cuspidatum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions.</p>
