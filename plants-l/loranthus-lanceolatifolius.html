                    <h1>Loranthus lanceolatifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus lanceolatifolius, commonly known as the lanceolate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
