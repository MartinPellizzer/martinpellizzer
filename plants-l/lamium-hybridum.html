<p>Lamium hybridum, commonly known as dead nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant is characterized by its lack of stinging hairs, distinguishing it from true nettles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Lamium hybridum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
