<p>Lepanthopsis densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, erect growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Lepanthopsis densiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
