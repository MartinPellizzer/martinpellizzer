                    <h1>Lotus brunneri var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Lotus brunneri var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lotus or small lotus, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to specific regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, bean-like fruits. Its leaves are finely divided and often float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
