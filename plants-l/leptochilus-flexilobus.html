                    <h1>Leptochilus flexilobus</h1>
<p>Leptochilus flexilobus, commonly known as the flexible-leaved liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the environment. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and specialized adaptations make it an important indicator species for assessing the health of moist, undisturbed habitats.</p>
