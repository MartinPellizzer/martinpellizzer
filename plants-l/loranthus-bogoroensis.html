                    <h1>Loranthus bogoroensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus bogoroensis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients directly from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are typically small and clustered.</p>
<p>Loranthus bogoroensis produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its propagation.</p>
