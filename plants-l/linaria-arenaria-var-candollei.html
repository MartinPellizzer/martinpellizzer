                    <h1>Linaria arenaria var. candollei</h1>
<p>Linaria arenaria var. candollei, commonly known as the sand everlasting or sand linaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss and aid in survival in sandy soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
