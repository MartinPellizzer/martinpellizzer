                    <h1>Lagynias monteiroi</h1>
<p>Lagynias monteiroi, commonly known as the Monteiro's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base of its pale green, fleshy stems. The plant produces small white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, round berries that are dispersed by birds. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Lagynias monteiroi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
