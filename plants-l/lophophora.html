                    <h1>Lophophora</h1>
<p>Lophophora, commonly known as peyote, is a small, spineless cacti native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, blue-green foliage and the presence of alkaloid-rich buttons on its stems. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in arid, well-drained soils. It is known for containing mescaline, a psychoactive compound, which has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Lophophora is also valued for its slow growth and unique appearance, making it a popular choice among succulent collectors.</p>
