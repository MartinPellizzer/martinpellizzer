<p>Lipocarpha comosa, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in brackish or saline water, making it a common sight in coastal marshes and estuaries. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment.</p>
<p>Lipocarpha comosa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
