<p>Lindsaea jamesoniiformis, commonly known as the Jameson's lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, linear segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Lindsaea jamesoniiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
