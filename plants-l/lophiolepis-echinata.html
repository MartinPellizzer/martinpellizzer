<p>Lophiolepis echinata, commonly known as the rough-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. The plant's thallus is typically crustose, forming a dense, leathery coating on rocks or soil surfaces. Its surface is often rough and covered with small, spine-like structures called pseudopores.</p>
<p>Lophiolepis echinata is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
