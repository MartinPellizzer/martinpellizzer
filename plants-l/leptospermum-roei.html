<p>Leptospermum roei, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments.</p>
