<p>Lankesterella ceracifolia, commonly known as the leafy liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, branched structure and small, scale-like leaves that are typically clustered in dense tufts. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are hidden beneath the leafy layers, making it less visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Lankesterella ceracifolia plays a vital role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its natural habitat.</p>
