<p>Lophopappus, commonly known as the pappus-bearing sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. The most distinctive feature of Lophopappus species is their pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal of seeds. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Lophopappus species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
