                    <h1>Loranthus cuspidatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus cuspidatus, commonly known as the prickly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant's stems are woody and often have small, sharp spines, giving it its common name. Its small, white or greenish flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
