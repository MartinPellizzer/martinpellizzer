<p>Lacosteopsis latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually submerged, with some reaching above the water surface for photosynthesis.</p>
