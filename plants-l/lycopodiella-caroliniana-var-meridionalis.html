                    <h1>Lycopodiella caroliniana var. meridionalis</h1>
<p>Lycopodiella caroliniana var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, branching structure and scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte generation produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from other forms of Lycopodiella caroliniana by its geographic distribution and slightly different morphological features.</p>
