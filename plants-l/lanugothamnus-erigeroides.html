<p>Lanugothamnus erigeroides, commonly known as the woolly thamnus, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, gray-green leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is often found in rocky soils and coastal areas, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an important component of Mediterranean flora.</p>
