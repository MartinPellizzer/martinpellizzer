                    <h1>Leucorchis albida f. breviloba</h1>
<p>Leucorchis albida f. breviloba, commonly known as the dwarf white orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
