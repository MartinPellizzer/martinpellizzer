                    <h1>Lysiphyllum strychnifolium</h1>
<p>Lysiphyllum strychnifolium, commonly known as the poison leaf or strychnifolium, is a rare and striking plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the wet season. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids, particularly strychnine, which are concentrated in its leaves and seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires careful handling by humans.</p>
