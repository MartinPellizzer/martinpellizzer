                    <h1>Loranthus hirsutiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus hirsutiflorus, commonly known as the hairy-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Rutaceae and Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
