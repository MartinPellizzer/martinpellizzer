<p>Lamprococcus farinosus var. discolor, commonly known as the pink scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Diaspididae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pink or reddish coloration, which becomes more pronounced as the insects mature. The plant it infests is typically a host-specific species, often found on various species of Eucalyptus. The female adults are sessile and covered in a waxy, powdery coating that gives them their characteristic appearance.</p>
<p>This plant is primarily of interest in entomology and plant pathology due to its impact on its host plants.</p>
