                    <h1>Leucotrichum schenckii</h1>
<p>Leucotrichum schenckii, commonly known as the silver hair lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to grayish upper surface and a white, woolly lower surface covered in fine, hair-like structures. The thallus is typically 1â€“3 cm in diameter, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. It is often found growing on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is notable for its slow growth and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality.</p>
