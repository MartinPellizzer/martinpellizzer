<p>Lipotriche, commonly known as the "crown vetch," is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the species. Lipotriche species are typically shrubs or perennial herbs, often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
