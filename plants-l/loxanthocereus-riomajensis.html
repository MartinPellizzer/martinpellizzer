                    <h1>Loxanthocereus riomajensis</h1>
<p>Loxanthocereus riomajensis, commonly known as the Riomaja night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species.</p>
<p>The cactus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens.</p>
