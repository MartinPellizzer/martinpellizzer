                    <h1>Loranthus tribracteatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus tribracteatus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Rutaceae and Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or greenish in color. Its fruits are typically red or yellow berries containing one or two seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa.</p>
