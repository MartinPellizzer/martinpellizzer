                    <h1>Lechea stricta</h1>
<p>Lechea stricta, commonly known as the rigid milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, branching stems that often remain green throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is known for its milky sap, which is a defining feature of the genus Asclepias.</p>
<p>Lechea stricta plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
