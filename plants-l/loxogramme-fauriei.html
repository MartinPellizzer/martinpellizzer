                    <h1>Loxogramme fauriei</h1>
<p>Loxogramme fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Loxogramme fauriei plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
