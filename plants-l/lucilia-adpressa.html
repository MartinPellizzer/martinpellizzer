                    <h1>Lucilia adpressa</h1>
<p>Lucilia adpressa, commonly known as the common green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its metallic green body and prominent, red eyes. The plant-like appearance of its larvae, which are often found on decaying organic matter, has led to its association with certain botanical environments. While not a plant itself, it plays a significant role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable substrates, making it an important indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
