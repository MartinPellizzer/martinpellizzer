This plant is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, which stand out against its grassy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in open meadows at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species.</p>
