<p>Lathyrus vestitus subsp.</p>
<p>puberulus, commonly known as the hairy pea or puberulous vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) leaves and stems, which provide a distinctive texture. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
