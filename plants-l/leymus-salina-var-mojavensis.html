                    <h1>Leymus salina var. mojavensis</h1>
<p>Leymus salina var. mojavensis, commonly known as the Mojave alkali grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in desert environments such as the Mojave Desert. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny seeds. It is adapted to withstand extreme drought and high salt concentrations, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in its habitat.</p>
