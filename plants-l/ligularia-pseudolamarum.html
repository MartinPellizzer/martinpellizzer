                    <h1>Ligularia pseudolamarum</h1>
<p>Ligularia pseudolamarum, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking perennial plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for water gardeners and wetland restoration projects.</p>
