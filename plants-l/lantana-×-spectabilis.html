                    <h1>Lantana × spectabilis</h1>
<p>Lantana × spectabilis, commonly known as the showy lantana, is a hybrid shrub native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It features clusters of small, brightly colored flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
