                    <h1>Larnalles dichotoma</h1>
<p>Larnalles dichotoma, commonly known as the split-stemmed lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive dichotomous branching pattern.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, especially in moist, shaded environments. The thallus is composed of a dense layer of fungal hyphae intertwined with algae, which provide the photosynthetic function. Its structure allows it to efficiently absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and substrate.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
