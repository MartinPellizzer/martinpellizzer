<p>Lycopodium herteri, commonly known as the Herter's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium herteri is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
