                    <h1>Leptobalanus diegogomezii</h1>
<p>Leptobalanus diegogomezii, commonly known as the Diego Gomez's evergreen tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and unique floral structures. The plant exhibits a high degree of morphological variability, which may be an adaptation to its specific microhabitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
