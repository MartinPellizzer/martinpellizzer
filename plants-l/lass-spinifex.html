                    <h1>Lass spinifex</h1>
<p>Lass spinifex, commonly known as spinifex grass, is a hardy perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively and stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Lass spinifex plays a crucial role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native environment.</p>
