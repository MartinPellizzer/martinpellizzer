                    <h1>Lycopodium clavatum var. megastachyon</h1>
<p>Lycopodium clavatum var. megastachyon, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a primitive vascular plant with characteristics resembling both ferns and true mosses.</p>
