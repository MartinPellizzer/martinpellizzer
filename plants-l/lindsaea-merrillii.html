                    <h1>Lindsaea merrillii</h1>
<p>Lindsaea merrillii, commonly known as the Merrillâ€™s spikemoss, is a member of the family Lindsaeaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. Lindsaea merrillii reproduces through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
