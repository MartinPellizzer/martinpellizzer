                    <h1>Lasius</h1>
<p>Lasius, commonly known as the ant genus, is a group of ground-nesting ants found primarily in temperate regions.</p>
<p>These ants are characterized by their small size, typically ranging from 2 to 6 millimeters in length, and their ability to form large colonies. They play a significant role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling through their foraging and nest-building activities. Many species of Lasius are known for their symbiotic relationships with蚜虫 (aphids), which they tend for honeydew.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 130 species, with some exhibiting complex social behaviors and division of labor.</p>
