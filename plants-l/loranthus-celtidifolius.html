                    <h1>Loranthus celtidifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus celtidifolius, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that contain seeds. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Its presence can sometimes weaken the host tree if left unchecked.</p>
