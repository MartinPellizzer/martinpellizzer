<p>Lycium woodii, commonly known as the "Desert枸杞" or "Caucasian boxthorn," is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Lycium woodii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes.</p>
