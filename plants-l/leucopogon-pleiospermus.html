                    <h1>Leucopogon pleiospermus</h1>
<p>Leucopogon pleiospermus, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or white, which attract nectar-feeding insects. It has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its often salty and windy environment.</p>
<p>Leucopogon pleiospermus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
