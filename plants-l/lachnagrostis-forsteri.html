<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range.</p>
<p>Lachnagrostis forsteri is often found in open grasslands and along the edges of desert scrub habitats.</p>
