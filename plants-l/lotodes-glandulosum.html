                    <h1>Lotodes glandulosum</h1>
<p>Lotodes glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give the plant its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in shallow water, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The sticky hairs on the leaves also aid in trapping small particles, contributing to water filtration.</p>
