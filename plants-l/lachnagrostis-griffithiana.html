                    <h1>Lachnagrostis griffithiana</h1>
<p>Lachnagrostis griffithiana, commonly known as Griffith's wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or arid soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments with low moisture and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
