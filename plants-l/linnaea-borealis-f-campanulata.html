                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. campanulata</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The plant features small, opposite leaves and produces two small, clustered flowers on each stem, which is a hallmark of the genus Linnaea. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>This form is less common than the typical twinflower and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology.</p>
