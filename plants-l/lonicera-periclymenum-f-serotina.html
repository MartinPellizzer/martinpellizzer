                    <h1>Lonicera periclymenum f. serotina</h1>
<p>Lonicera periclymenum f. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom later in the season compared to other honeysuckle species, typically from late summer to early autumn. The flowers are usually yellow or orange-red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This form is notable for its extended blooming period, which provides a longer nectar source for wildlife.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks.</p>
