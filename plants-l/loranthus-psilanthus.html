                    <h1>Loranthus psilanthus</h1>
<p>Loranthus psilanthus, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Loranthus psilanthus plays an ecological role in supporting bird populations by providing food through its berries.</p>
