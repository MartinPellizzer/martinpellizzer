                    <h1>Loranthus globifer var. verrucosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus globifer var. verrucosus, commonly known as the rough-fruited mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or reddish in color, and its berries are typically yellow or red, containing sticky seeds that aid in dispersal by birds. It is native to regions of southern Africa and is often found in coastal forests and woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
