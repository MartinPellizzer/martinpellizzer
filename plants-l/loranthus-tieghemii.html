                    <h1>Loranthus tieghemii</h1>
<p>Loranthus tieghemii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are important food sources for birds and other animals. Its growth is seasonal, with the most visible development occurring during the wetter months.</p>
<p>Loranthus tieghemii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and supporting local wildlife.</p>
