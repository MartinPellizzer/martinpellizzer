<p>Lilium pardalinum subsp.</p>
<p>wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins' lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking red to orange flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a single, tall stem bearing the showy flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
