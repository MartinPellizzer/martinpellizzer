                    <h1>Loranthus quinquangulus</h1>
<p>Loranthus quinquangulus, commonly known as the five-angled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in groups of five. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forested areas where it forms a symbiotic relationship with its host trees.</p>
