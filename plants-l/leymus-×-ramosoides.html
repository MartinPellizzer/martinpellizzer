                    <h1>Leymus × ramosoides</h1>
<p>Leymus × ramosoides, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often reddish-colored stems. The plant produces inflorescences that are typically panicle-like, bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between Leymus arenarius and Leymus triticoides.</p>
