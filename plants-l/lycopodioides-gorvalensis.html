                    <h1>Lycopodioides gorvalensis</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides gorvalensis, commonly known as the Gorvalen clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and its morphological resemblance to other clubmosses. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are spiral-shaped and lack true vascular bundles, a feature common in primitive plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lycopodioides gorvalensis is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
