<p>Limeum viscosum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the sticky lime tree, is a variant of the sticky lime plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, resinous sap, which gives it its common name and contributes to its unique botanical properties. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing fragrant, yellowish blooms that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, yellowish drupe, which is edible but has a mildly acidic and sometimes bitter taste.</p>
