                    <h1>Lepidomicrosorium superficiale</h1>
<p>Lepidomicrosorium superficiale, commonly known as the floating moss, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lepidocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that form a dense mat on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant lacks true roots and instead anchors itself using rhizoids, which help it adhere to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are small and inconspicuous, producing spores that are dispersed by water currents.</p>
<p>Lepidomicrosorium superficiale plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
