                    <h1>Lapeirousia manuleiflora</h1>
<p>Lapeirousia manuleiflora, commonly known as the Kleinmann's rain lily, is a striking South African bulbous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white to pale pink, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that die back after flowering, allowing the bulb to store energy for the next blooming season. Native to the Western Cape province, it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
