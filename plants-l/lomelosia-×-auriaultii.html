<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Lomelosia alpina and Lomelosia stenophylla, showcasing a combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
