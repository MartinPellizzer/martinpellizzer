                    <h1>Leucoptera subcarnosa</h1>
<p>Leucoptera subcarnosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered threatened in its natural range.</p>
