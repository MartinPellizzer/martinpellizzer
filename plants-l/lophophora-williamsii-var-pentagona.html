                    <h1>Lophophora williamsii var. pentagona</h1>
<p>Lophophora williamsii var. pentagona, commonly known as the "peyote cactus," is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth pattern and the presence of a single, short stem that often produces multiple offsets. The plant is notable for its bright green color and the presence of areoles, which are specialized structures that bear the plant's characteristic spines and flowers. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its alkaloid content, including mescaline, makes it significant in both cultural and medicinal contexts.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species.</p>
