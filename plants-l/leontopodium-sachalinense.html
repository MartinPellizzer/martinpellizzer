<p>Leontopodium sachalinense, commonly known as the Sachalin edelweiss, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Korean Peninsula and parts of northeastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking, showy flower heads that resemble the edelweiss. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually white or pale pink, surrounded by a cluster of bracts that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
