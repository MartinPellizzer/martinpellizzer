<p>Leptocereus prostratus, commonly known as the low cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a sprawling, low-growing plant with cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its stems are adapted for storing water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The low cholla is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can provide habitat for various desert animals.</p>
