                    <h1>Loranthus cistoides</h1>
<p>Loranthus cistoides, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, leathery leaves and white, waxy flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
