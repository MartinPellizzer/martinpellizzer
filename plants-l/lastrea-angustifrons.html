<p>Lastrea angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lastrea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant features linear, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
