                    <h1>Lachnopylis terminalioides</h1>
<p>Lachnopylis terminalioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a leathery, crust-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish-green upper surface. The plant exhibits a complex structure with distinct layers, including the upper cortex, algal layer, and lower cortex. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
