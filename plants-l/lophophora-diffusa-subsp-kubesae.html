<p>Lophophora diffusa subsp.</p>
<p>kubesae, commonly known as the Kubes ghost flower, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its pale yellow to pink flowers that appear in late spring, often resembling ghostly apparitions against the desert landscape.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, cylindrical stem covered in white to pale green spines, and it produces small, rounded, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a unique addition to arid garden environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
