                    <h1>Leptonium</h1>
<p>Leptonium, commonly known as the common leptonium, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. Leptonium species are native to various regions in Europe and Asia, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>They are not widely cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological roles.</p>
