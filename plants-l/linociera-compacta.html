<p>Linociera compacta, commonly known as the compact rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it well adapted to harsh coastal environments.</p>
<p>Linociera compacta is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
