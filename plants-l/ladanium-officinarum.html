                    <h1>Ladanium officinarum</h1>
<p>Ladanium officinarum, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-blue hue due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically ranging from white to pale purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies.</p>
