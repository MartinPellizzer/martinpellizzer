<p>Liparis gerrardii, commonly known as the Florida panther orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a slender, wiry stem and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in pine flatwoods and wetlands, often in shaded environments. Its reproductive cycle is closely tied to specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its germination and growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
