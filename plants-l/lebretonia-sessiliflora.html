                    <h1>Lebretonia sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Lebretonia sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates.</p>
