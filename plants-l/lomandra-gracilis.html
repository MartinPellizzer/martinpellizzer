                    <h1>Lomandra gracilis</h1>
<p>Lomandra gracilis, commonly known as slender lomandra, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a compact rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late summer, which are borne on spikes rising from the center of the plant. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it suitable for erosion control and ground cover in gardens.</p>
<p>Lomandra gracilis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for native landscaping.</p>
