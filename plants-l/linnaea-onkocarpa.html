<p>Linnaea onkocarpa, commonly known as the red-flowered twinleaf, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Actinidiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, opposite leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink to red in color, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are fleshy berries that mature to a deep orange or red hue, containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linnaea onkocarpa is considered an endangered species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
