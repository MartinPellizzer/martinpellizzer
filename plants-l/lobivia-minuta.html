                    <h1>Lobivia minuta</h1>
<p>Lobivia minuta, commonly known as the miniature lobivia, is a small succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features compact, cylindrical stems with a short, thick caudex and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
