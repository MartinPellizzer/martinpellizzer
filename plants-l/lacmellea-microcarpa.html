<p>Lacmellea microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf star moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-like thallus structure. The plant has a low-growing habit with a dense, cushion-like appearance, often carpeting the forest floor. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in small clusters on the thallus surface.</p>
<p>Lacmellea microcarpa thrives in cool, humid climates and is often used as an indicator species for undisturbed, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
