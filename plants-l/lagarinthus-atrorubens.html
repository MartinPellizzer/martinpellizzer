                    <h1>Lagarinthus atrorubens</h1>
<p>Lagarinthus atrorubens, commonly known as the red-bellied spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>This perennial herbaceous plant features slender, hairy stems and produces showy, spider-like flowers with distinctive red and orange markings. The flowers bloom in late summer, typically from July to September, and are pollinated by specific flies and wasps. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
