                    <h1>Lolium ambiguum</h1>
<p>Lolium ambiguum, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Lolium ambiguum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also serves as forage for livestock.</p>
