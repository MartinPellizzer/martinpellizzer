                            <h1>Lithocarpus Grandifolius</h1>
<p>Lithocarpus grandifolius is a striking evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. Known for its large, glossy leaves and distinctive fruit, it plays a vital role in its ecosystem. This species is often found in shaded, humid environments where it thrives under the canopy of taller trees. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. Despite its beauty and utility, Lithocarpus grandifolius faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
