                    <h1>Leptospermum aquaticum</h1>
<p>Leptospermum aquaticum, commonly known as the swamp tea tree, is a low-growing shrub native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist, often acidic habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, usually from late winter to early spring. Its roots are fibrous and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Leptospermum aquaticum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
