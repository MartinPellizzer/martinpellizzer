                    <h1>Laguncularia racemosa</h1>
<p>Laguncularia racemosa, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often found in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant has specialized structures called pneumatophores, which help it breathe in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in saline conditions.</p>
<p>Laguncularia racemosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life.</p>
