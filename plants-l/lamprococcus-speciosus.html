                    <h1>Lamprococcus speciosus</h1>
<p>Lamprococcus speciosus, commonly known as the golden wax scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, golden-brown body covered in a waxy, protective coating. The plant hosts of this species are typically broad-leaved evergreens, particularly species within the family Ericaceae. Lamprococcus speciosus feeds on the sap of its host plants, causing deformation and discoloration of leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for a decorative plant rather than a pest.</p>
