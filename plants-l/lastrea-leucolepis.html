                    <h1>Lastrea leucolepis</h1>
<p>Lastrea leucolepis, commonly known as the silver leaf cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure composed of cylindrical, spiny stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, giving it its common name. The plant's leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its adaptations include thick, water-storing stems and a waxy coating that reduces water loss, making it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and distinctive appearance.</p>
