<p>Lappa × rehmannii, commonly known as the hybrid giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other members like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy umbels of white flowers. The plant can grow up to 5 meters in height, with a thick, hairy stem that exudes a milky sap when broken. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
