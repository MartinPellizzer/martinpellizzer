                    <h1>Limonium xerophilum</h1>
<p>Limonium xerophilum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions by reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Limonium xerophilum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
