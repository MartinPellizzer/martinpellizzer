<p>Lepironia articulata, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Lepironia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from water. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its roots are aquatic, anchoring it in wetland environments, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form colonies.</p>
<p>Lepironia articulata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
