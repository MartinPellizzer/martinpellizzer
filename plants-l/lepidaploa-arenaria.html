                    <h1>Lepidaploa arenaria</h1>
<p>Lepidaploa arenaria, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a member of the Lichenes family and is characterized by its unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and coastal environments, where it forms a thin, crust-like growth on rocky surfaces or sandy soils. The plant's structure is primarily composed of the fungal component, with the alga contributing to photosynthesis. It is typically light green to yellowish in color and lacks distinct leaves or stems.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat, it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
