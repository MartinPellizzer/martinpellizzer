                    <h1>Ligustrum vulgare var. buxifolium</h1>
<p>Ligustrum vulgare var. buxifolium, commonly known as the boxleaf privet, is a variant of the common privet characterized by its dense, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and resemble those of boxwood, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often used as a hedge or ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate pruning.</p>
<p>This variety is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to various regions around the world.</p>
