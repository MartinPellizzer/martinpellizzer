                    <h1>Lagenandra peradeniyae var. speciosa</h1>
<p>Lagenandra peradeniyae var. speciosa, commonly known as the Sri Lankan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the wet zone of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a complex structure typical of orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
