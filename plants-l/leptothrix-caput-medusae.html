                    <h1>Leptothrix caput-medusae</h1>
<p>Leptothrix caput-medusae, commonly known as the "Medusa's head" bacterium, is a type of filamentous bacterium that forms gelatinous sheaths around its cells.</p>
<p>It is a member of the order Acidobacteriales and is often found in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers. The organism is characterized by its long, twisted filaments that resemble the tentacles of a medusa, giving it its common name. It is capable of forming biofilms and plays a role in the microbial community by contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological function make it an interesting subject in microbiology and environmental studies.</p>
