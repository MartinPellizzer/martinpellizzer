                <h1>Lepisorus longifolius</h1>
<p>Lepisorus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved wood moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Lepisorus longifolius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
