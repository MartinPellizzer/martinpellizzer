                            <h1>Lobelia Decurrens</h1>
<p>Blue lobelia, scientifically known as Lobelia decurrens, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This perennial herb thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate leaves and striking blooms make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a natural, wildflower look. Despite its beauty, it requires careful cultivation to thrive in garden settings.</p>
