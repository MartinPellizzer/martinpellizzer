<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pendant flowers that often display vibrant colors such as pink, white, or yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by specific insects, and it is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy cultivation.</p>
