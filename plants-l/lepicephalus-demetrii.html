                    <h1>Lepicephalus demetrii</h1>
<p>Lepicephalus demetrii, commonly known as the Demetrius's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, ghostly white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, tubular stem and possesses a single, elongated leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, making it highly dependent on its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Lepicephalus demetrii is considered critically endangered.</p>
