                    <h1>Lachnaea glomerata</h1>
<p>Lachnaea glomerata, commonly known as the clustered lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, compact growths on tree trunks and bark, often appearing as a greenish or yellowish crust. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air. It is typically found in temperate regions and is known for its slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Lachnaea glomerata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
