                    <h1>Loranthus multiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, including South Africa, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and its berries are typically red or yellow, attracting birds for seed dispersal. It is often found in forested areas, growing on trees such as acacias and eucalyptus.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
