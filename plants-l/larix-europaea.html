                    <h1>Larix europaea</h1>
<p>Larix europaea, commonly known as the European larch, is a deciduous conifer native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to shed its needle-like leaves in the fall, making it one of the few evergreen trees that lose its foliage annually. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against pests and environmental stress.</p>
<p>The European larch is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
