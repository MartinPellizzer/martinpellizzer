<p>Lindsaea hainaniana, commonly known as the Hainan maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Lindsaea hainaniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
