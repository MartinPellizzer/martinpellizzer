                    <h1>Lacinaria vittata</h1>
<p>Lacinaria vittata, commonly known as the spotted lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lichenes, and is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant's thallus is usually crust-like, forming a dense, adherent layer on surfaces such as bark or stone. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance, marked by a spotted or mottled pattern, makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat.</p>
