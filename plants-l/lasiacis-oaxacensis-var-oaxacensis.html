<p>Lasiacis oaxacensis var. oaxacensis, commonly known as the Oaxacan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus *Pseudolmedia*, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. It produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
