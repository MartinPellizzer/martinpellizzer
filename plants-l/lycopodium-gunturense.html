                    <h1>Lycopodium gunturense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium gunturense, commonly known as the Guntur clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Lycopodium gunturense is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
