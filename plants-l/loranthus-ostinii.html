                    <h1>Loranthus ostinii</h1>
<p>Loranthus ostinii, commonly known as the Italian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and other broadleaf species, through a specialized structure called a haustellum. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus ostinii plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for various bird species and contributing to the nutrient cycle of its host tree.</p>
