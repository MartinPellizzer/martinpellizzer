                    <h1>Loxanthocereus gracilis</h1>
<p>Loxanthocereus gracilis, commonly known as the slender night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white spines. The plant produces striking, large, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Loxanthocereus gracilis is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a resilient plant in desert environments.</p>
