<p>Lampranthus glaucoides, commonly known as the blue ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.

Its leaves are typically small and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lampranthus glaucoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
