<p>Lemmaphyllum drymoglossoides, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a woody shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in plant ecology and biodiversity.</p>
