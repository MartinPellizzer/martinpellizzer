                    <h1>Loranthus medinensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus medinensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, spherical growth that can weigh several kilograms, often leading to the death of its host if left unchecked. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds that can cause severe illness.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Loranthus medinensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
