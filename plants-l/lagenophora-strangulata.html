                    <h1>Lagenophora strangulata</h1>
<p>Lagenophora strangulata, commonly known as the strangler fig, is a tropical plant belonging to the Moraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiepiphytic vine that begins its life as an epiphyte growing on the branches of a host tree. As it matures, it sends down aerial roots that encircle the host, eventually causing it to suffocate and die. The plant's unique growth habit allows it to thrive in dense forest canopies where light is limited.</p>
<p>Its fruit, which is a small, fleshy berry, plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by providing food for various animals.</p>
