                    <h1>Loranthus neocaledonicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It relies on a variety of host trees, primarily from the Myrtaceae family, for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to the biodiversity of the forest canopy.</p>
