                    <h1>Loranthus odontocalyx</h1>
<p>Loranthus odontocalyx, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind or birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
