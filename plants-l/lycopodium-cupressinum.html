                    <h1>Lycopodium cupressinum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium cupressinum, commonly known as the club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte structure that resembles a small tree or shrub. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Lycopodium cupressinum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
