<p>Liparis neoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in shaded, moist environments within tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate, which is typical for many orchid species.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually short-lived but play an important role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
