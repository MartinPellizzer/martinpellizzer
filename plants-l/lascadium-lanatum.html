                    <h1>Lascadium lanatum</h1>
<p>Lascadium lanatum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that help in trapping small aquatic insects. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in nutrient-poor environments by digesting its prey to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for studying plant evolution and ecological interactions.</p>
