                    <h1>Lilium batemanniae</h1>
<p>Lilium batemanniae, commonly known as Bateman's lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and erect.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
