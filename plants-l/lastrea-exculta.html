                    <h1>Lastrea exculta</h1>
<p>Lastrea exculta, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hair. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warm season, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in dry environments.</p>
<p>Lastrea exculta is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
