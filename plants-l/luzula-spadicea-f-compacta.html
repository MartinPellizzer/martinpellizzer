The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in humid climates.</p>
