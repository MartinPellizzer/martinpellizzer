                    <h1>Loranthus alternifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus alternifolius, commonly known as the alternate-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has opposite, alternate leaves that are usually oval or elliptical in shape. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are an important food source for birds and other animals.</p>
