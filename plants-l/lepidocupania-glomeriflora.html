                    <h1>Lepidocupania glomeriflora</h1>
<p>Lepidocupania glomeriflora, commonly known as the clustered-flowered lepidocupania, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are adapted to its moist, shaded habitats. Its reproductive structures are particularly noteworthy for their unique arrangement and specialized pollination mechanisms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
