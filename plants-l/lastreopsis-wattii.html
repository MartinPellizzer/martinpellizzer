                    <h1>Lastreopsis wattii</h1>
<p>Lastreopsis wattii, commonly known as the New Zealand lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish-green thallus with a smooth, leathery surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterial partner, which contributes to its ability to photosynthesize. It typically grows on rock surfaces in humid, temperate environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
