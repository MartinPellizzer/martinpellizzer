                    <h1>Lycopodium hohenackeri</h1>
<p>Lycopodium hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's clubmoss, is a species of small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of whorled leaves that form a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium hohenackeri is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studying ancient plant lineages and their ecological adaptations.</p>
