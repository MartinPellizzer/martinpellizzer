                    <h1>Loranthus spraguei</h1>
<p>Loranthus spraguei, commonly known as the Spragueâ€™s mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects, and its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its berries.</p>
<p>This species is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
