                    <h1>Limonium caspium var. patens</h1>
<p>Limonium caspium var. patens, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that release seeds through a mechanism triggered by wind or touch. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Limonium caspium var. patens is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
