<p>Ligusticum cusickii, commonly known as Cusick's lovage, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly found in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a distinctive scent when crushed. Its small white to greenish flowers appear in umbrella-shaped clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
