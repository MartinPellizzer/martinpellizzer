<p>Lysimachia peploides, commonly known as carpet bugle or golden thread, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors, and is often found in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in wetland restoration projects.</p>
