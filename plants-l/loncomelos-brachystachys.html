                    <h1>Loncomelos brachystachys</h1>
<p>Loncomelos brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and gelatinous, sticky berries that aid in seed dispersal by birds. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
