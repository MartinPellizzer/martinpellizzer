                    <h1>Loranthus sagittifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus sagittifolius, commonly known as the arrowleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees for germination.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
