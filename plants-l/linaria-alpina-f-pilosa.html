<p>Linaria alpina f. pilosa, commonly known as the Alpine toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Linaria alpina f. pilosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments.</p>
