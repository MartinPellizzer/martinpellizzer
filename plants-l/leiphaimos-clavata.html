<p>Leiphaimos clavata, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the spores. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its habitat.</p>
<p>Leiphaimos clavata plays a role in the ecological balance by providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
