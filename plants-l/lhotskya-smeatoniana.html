                    <h1>Lhotskya smeatoniana</h1>
<p>Lhotskya smeatoniana, commonly known as the Smeaton's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
