<p>Ligularia frigida, commonly known as the Arctic groundsel, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, arranged in a dense, clustered inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
