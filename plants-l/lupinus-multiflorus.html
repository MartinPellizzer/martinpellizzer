<p>Lupinus multiflorus, commonly known as the multibloom lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces numerous small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Lupinus multiflorus is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules.</p>
