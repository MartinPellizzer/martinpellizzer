                    <h1>Liparis fantastica</h1>
<p>Liparis fantastica, commonly known as the celestial orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, iridescent petals that shift in color depending on light conditions, a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators. The plant's roots are highly sensitive to moisture, requiring a consistently damp yet well-draining environment to thrive. Its flowering season occurs during the rainy season, producing delicate, fragrant blooms that last only a few days.</p>
<p>Botanists are particularly interested in its genetic makeup due to its unusual resistance to certain fungal diseases.</p>
