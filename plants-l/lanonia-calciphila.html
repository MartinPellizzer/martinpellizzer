                    <h1>Lanonia calciphila</h1>
<p>Lanonia calciphila, commonly known as the limestone lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in calcareous environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose growth form, with a leathery, leaf-like structure that is typically light green to yellowish in color. This lichen is often found on rocks, soil, or tree trunks in areas with high calcium content. Its ability to survive in such conditions makes it an important indicator of limestone-rich habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized organism.</p>
