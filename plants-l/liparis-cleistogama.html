                    <h1>Liparis cleistogama</h1>
<p>Liparis cleistogama, commonly known as the closed flower orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, often leafless stems and its unique reproductive strategy, producing cleistogamous flowers that remain closed and self-pollinate. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories. Its flowers are small and greenish, lacking the showy petals of many other orchid species.</p>
<p>Liparis cleistogama is valued for its ecological role in supporting specific pollinators and its resilience in disturbed environments.</p>
