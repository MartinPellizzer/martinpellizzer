                    <h1>Leersia mexicana</h1>
<p>Leersia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican leersia, is a perennial grass species native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Leersia mexicana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
