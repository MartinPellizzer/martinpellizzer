                    <h1>Lobivia atrovirens var. yuquinensis</h1>
<p>Lobivia atrovirens var. yuquinensis, commonly known as the Yuquinensis Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dark green to bluish-green coloration, often marked with faint, irregular lines. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific environmental requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
