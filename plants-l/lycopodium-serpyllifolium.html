                    <h1>Lycopodium serpyllifolium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium serpyllifolium, commonly known as ground pine, is a small evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with closely clustered, scale-like leaves that give it a pine-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the leaf clusters. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, particularly in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Lycopodium serpyllifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy, low-maintenance nature.</p>
