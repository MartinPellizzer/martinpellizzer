<p>Lysinema spicatum, commonly known as the spicate lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota division. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Lysinema spicatum plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
