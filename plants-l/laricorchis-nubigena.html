                    <h1>Laricorchis nubigena</h1>
<p>Laricorchis nubigena, commonly known as the cloud orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in the shadow of mountain forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from the poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and climate change, this species is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
