<p>Lobivia higginsiana var. carnea, commonly known as the pink lobivia, is a compact, branching cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features pale green to bluish-gray stems that are ribbed and covered in short, white spines. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
