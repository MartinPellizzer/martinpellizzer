                    <h1>Loranthus molliflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus molliflorus, commonly known as the soft-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered in small groups. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Africa and is often associated with specific host trees like acacias and eucalyptus.</p>
