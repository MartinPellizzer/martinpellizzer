<p>Limosella ciliata, commonly known as the threadleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Limosella ciliata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
