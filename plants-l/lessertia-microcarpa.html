                    <h1>Lessertia microcarpa</h1>
<p>Lessertia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf silver tree, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Lessertia microcarpa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in coastal gardens.</p>
