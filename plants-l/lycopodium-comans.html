<p>Lycopodium comans, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium comans thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
