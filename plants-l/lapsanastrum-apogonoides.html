                    <h1>Lapsanastrum apogonoides</h1>
<p>Lapsanastrum apogonoides, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its antifungal and antiseptic qualities.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
