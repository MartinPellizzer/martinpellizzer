                    <h1>Leucoma</h1>
<p>Leucoma, commonly known as the "blindweed," is a small, annual plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, linear leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and borne in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Leucoma is notable for its ability to produce a milky latex when its stems are broken, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
