<p>Limnia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water flea, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce different leaf shapes depending on light and nutrient conditions. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and can form dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are usually filamentous or blade-like, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Limnia heterophylla plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
