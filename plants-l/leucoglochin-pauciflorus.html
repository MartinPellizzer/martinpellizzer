<p>Leucoglochin pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered white glochidion, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a soft, velvety texture, while its flowers are pale white with five petals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
