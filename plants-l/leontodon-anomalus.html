                    <h1>Leontodon anomalus</h1>
<p>Leontodon anomalus, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Leontodon anomalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions.</p>
