                    <h1>Lycopodium clavatum f. nanum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium clavatum f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a low-growing fern ally characterized by its compact, mat-forming structure.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, which are typically less than 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, at the tips of its stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This fern ally is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability.</p>
