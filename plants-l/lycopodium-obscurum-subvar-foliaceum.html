                    <h1>Lycopodium obscurum subvar. foliaceum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium obscurum subvar. foliaceum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically clustered around the stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are cone-like and often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors, and is commonly found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
