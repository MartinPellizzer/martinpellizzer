                    <h1>Lecaniodiscus cupanioides</h1>
<p>Lecaniodiscus cupanioides, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a common adaptation for reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Lecaniodiscus cupanioides is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established.</p>
