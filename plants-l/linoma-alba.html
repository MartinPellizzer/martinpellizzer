<p>Linoma alba, commonly known as the white lichen, is a type of lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces in temperate and arctic regions. The plant exhibits a whitish or grayish color due to the presence of the algal component. Linoma alba is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and slow growth make it an important subject in ecological studies.</p>
