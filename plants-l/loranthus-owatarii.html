                    <h1>Loranthus owatarii</h1>
<p>Loranthus owatarii, commonly known as the Japanese mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily members of the Rutaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem-like structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Loranthus owatarii is native to East Asia and is often found in temperate forests where its host trees thrive.</p>
