                    <h1>Leucopogon oblongifolius</h1>
<p>Leucopogon oblongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in heathlands or coastal areas, and is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
