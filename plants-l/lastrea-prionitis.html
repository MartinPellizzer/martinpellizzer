<p>Lastrea prionitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant features narrow, upright leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
