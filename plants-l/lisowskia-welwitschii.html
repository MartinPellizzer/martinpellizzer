<p>Lisowskia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its two large, paddle-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody trunk and can live for over 2,000 years, making it one of the oldest living organisms on Earth. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access underground water sources.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary uniqueness and its role as an indicator of ancient plant lineages.</p>
