                    <h1>Loranthus terrestris</h1>
<p>Loranthus terrestris, commonly known as the creeping mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often overlooked. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Europe and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
