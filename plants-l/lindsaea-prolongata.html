<p>Lindsaea prolongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a distinctive, narrow and elongated shape. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spore sacs called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically arranged in lines along the veins. Lindsaea prolongata thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in the study of epiphytic plant life.</p>
