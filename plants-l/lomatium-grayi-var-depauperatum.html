                    <h1>Lomatium grayi var. depauperatum</h1>
<p>Lomatium grayi var. depauperatum, commonly known as the sparse-stemmed lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streambanks. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced floral structure and smaller, more sparse leaves compared to other lomatium species.</p>
