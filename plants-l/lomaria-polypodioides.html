<p>Lomaria polypodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Lomaria polypodioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
