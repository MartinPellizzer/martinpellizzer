                <h1>Lobivia haagei</h1>
<p>Lobivia haagei, commonly known as the "Hager's lobivia," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that helps it absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Lobivia haagei is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
