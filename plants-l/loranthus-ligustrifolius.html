                    <h1>Loranthus ligustrifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus ligustrifolius, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, influencing tree growth and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
