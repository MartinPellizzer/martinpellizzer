<p>Linum suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping flax or wild flax, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 20â€“60 cm, featuring slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Linum suffruticosum is known for its fibrous stems, which have been historically used for textile production, similar to its more famous relative, flax.</p>
