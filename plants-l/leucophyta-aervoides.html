                    <h1>Leucophyta aervoides</h1>
<p>Leucophyta aervoides, commonly known as the silverleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its showy, daisy-like flowers bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Leucophyta aervoides is often found in open woods and along streambanks, thriving in partial shade to full sun.</p>
