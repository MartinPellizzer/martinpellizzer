<p>Lupinus xenophytus, commonly known as the ghost lupin, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Lupinus xenophytus is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological resilience make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
