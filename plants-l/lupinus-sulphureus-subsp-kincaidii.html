<p>Lupinus sulphureus subsp.</p>
<p>kincaidii, commonly known as Kincaid's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and palmately divided leaves, which are typical of the lupine genus.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and along streambanks. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Kincaid's lupine is also a critical component of native plant communities and is considered a keystone species in certain ecosystems.</p>
