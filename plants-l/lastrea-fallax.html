<p>Lastrea fallax, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in spring. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Lastrea fallax is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
