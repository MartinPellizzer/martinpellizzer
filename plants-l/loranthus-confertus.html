                    <h1>Loranthus confertus</h1>
<p>Loranthus confertus, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches to its host tree, typically a member of the Eucalyptus genus, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host, while also performing photosynthesis with its broad, leathery leaves. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating further propagation.</p>
