                    <h1>Loranthus longibracteatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches to its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus, through a specialized root-like structure called a haustellum. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its elliptical, leathery leaves are typically arranged in pairs along the stem.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses its sticky seeds, which can adhere to other host plants.</p>
