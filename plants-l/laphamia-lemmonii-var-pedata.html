                    <h1>Laphamia lemmonii var. pedata</h1>
<p>Laphamia lemmonii var. pedata, commonly known as the Lemmon's laphamia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a feathery appearance, typical of many members of its family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
