                    <h1>Lithocarpus coinhensis</h1>
<p>Lithocarpus coinhensis, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree native to the Philippines, characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree produces small, inedible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which are typically dispersed by animals. Its leaves are革质 (leathery) and glossy, with a deep green color, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
