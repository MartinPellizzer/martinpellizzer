                    <h1>Lastrea atrata</h1>
<p>Lastrea atrata, commonly known as the black-leaved stapeliad, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically dark green to black in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces unique, hood-like flowers that are often yellow or orange, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Lastrea atrata is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
