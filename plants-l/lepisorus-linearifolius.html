                    <h1>Lepisorus linearifolius</h1>
<p>Lepisorus linearifolius, commonly known as the linear-leaf polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Lepisorus linearifolius is often found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
