                    <h1>Lacinaria punctata var. turgida</h1>
<p>Lacinaria punctata var. turgida, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its inflated, sac-like structures called bladders.</p>
<p>These bladders are specialized for capturing small aquatic organisms, such as insects and crustaceans, through a mechanism involving water pressure changes. The plant belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is known for its carnivorous adaptations. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments with abundant sunlight.</p>
<p>Its morphology includes delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that aid in buoyancy and photosynthesis.</p>
