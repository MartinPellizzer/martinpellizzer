<p>Lycopodium serpens, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a species of primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, scale-like leaves that form a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces small, spiral-shaped cones that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in forest understories and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Lycopodium serpens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
