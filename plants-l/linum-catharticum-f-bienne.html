                    <h1>Linum catharticum f. bienne</h1>
<p>Linum catharticum f. bienne, commonly known as the two-row flax, is a variant of the flax plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces capsules containing numerous small, oval seeds. It is often grown for its fibrous stalks, which are used in textile production, and its seeds, which can be pressed for oil.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the standard flax species.</p>
