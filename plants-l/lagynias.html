                    <h1>Lagynias</h1>
<p>Lagynias, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic to animals and humans. They typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce clusters of small, usually pink or white flowers. Lagynias species are often found in disturbed soils and are common in temperate regions.</p>
<p>They play an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies.</p>
