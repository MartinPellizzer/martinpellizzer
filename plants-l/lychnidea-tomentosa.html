                    <h1>Lychnidea tomentosa</h1>
<p>Lychnidea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Its leaves are covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to nutrient-poor environments by capturing and digesting small organisms.</p>
