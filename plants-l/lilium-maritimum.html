<p>Lilium maritimum, commonly known as the sea lily, is a species of lily native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, often in areas with high salinity and strong winds. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh maritime conditions.</p>
<p>The sea lily is an important part of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and birds.</p>
