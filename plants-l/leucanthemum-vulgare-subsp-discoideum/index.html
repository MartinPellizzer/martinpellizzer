                            <h1>Leucanthemum Vulgare Subsp. Discoideum</h1>
<p>Oxeye daisy, scientifically known as Leucanthemum vulgare subsp. discoideum, is a common wildflower found in meadows and grasslands across Europe and parts of Asia. It is easily recognized by its large white petals surrounded by a ring of yellow-orange ray florets. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and blooms from late spring to early autumn. Its simple yet striking appearance makes it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes. Despite its beauty, the oxeye daisy is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and light levels.</p>
