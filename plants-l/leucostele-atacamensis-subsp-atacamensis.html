<p>Leucostele atacamensis subsp.</p>
<p>atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama leucostele, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf and stem structures adapted to extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, sprawling growth habit to minimize water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink, which attract pollinators in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
