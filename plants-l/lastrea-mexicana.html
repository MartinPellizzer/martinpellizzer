<p>Lastrea mexicana, commonly known as Mexican rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged droughts. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Lastrea mexicana produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage.</p>
