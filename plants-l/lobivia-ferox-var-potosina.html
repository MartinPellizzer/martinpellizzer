                    <h1>Lobivia ferox var. potosina</h1>
<p>Lobivia ferox var. potosina, commonly known as the Potosi lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features compact, cylindrical stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated by experienced succulent enthusiasts.</p>
