<p>Leptochloa falcata, commonly known as the hookleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hook-shaped tip, which gives it its scientific name. Its flowering stems are slender and often produce small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Leptochloa falcata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
