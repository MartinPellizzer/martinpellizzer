                    <h1>Lecointea amazonica</h1>
<p>Lecointea amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian lecointea, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of the rainforest. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lecointea amazonica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
