                    <h1>Loranthus schimperi var. parviflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus schimperi var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is native to regions of Africa, particularly Ethiopia. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, white or pale green flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries as fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
