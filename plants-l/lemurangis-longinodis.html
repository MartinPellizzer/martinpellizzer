<p>Lemurangis longinodis, commonly known as the long-nosed lemurangis, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to vibrant red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and specific species of bees. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, dark green leaves that have a slightly waxy texture. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals after consumption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Lemurangis longinodis is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
