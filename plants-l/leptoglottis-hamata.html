<p>Leptoglottis hamata, commonly known as the New Zealand sword fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are often bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in its ecological interactions.</p>
