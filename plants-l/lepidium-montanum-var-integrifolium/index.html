                            <h1>Lepidium Montanum Var. Integrifolium</h1>
<p>Lepidium montanum var. integrifolium is a lesser-known yet fascinating plant species found in high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, known for its diverse and ecologically important members. This variant is characterized by its entire leaves and compact growth habit, making it distinct from other Lepidium species. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often in areas with poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
