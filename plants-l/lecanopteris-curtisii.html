<p>Lecanopteris curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance.</p>
