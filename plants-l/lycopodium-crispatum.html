<p>Lycopodium crispatum, commonly known as the curled clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters, giving it a club-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cones.</p>
<p>Lycopodium crispatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
