<p>Lilium loddigesianum, commonly known as the Loddiges' lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the wetlands of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is now critically endangered and is protected in several botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
