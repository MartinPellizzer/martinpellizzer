<p>Lastreopsis microlepioides, commonly known as the small-leaved lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its flattened, leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish-gray in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal partner, allowing it to thrive on rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments. Its structure consists of a cortex, medulla, and algal layer, which together enable it to absorb nutrients and water efficiently.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
