                    <h1>Lasiospora ispahanica</h1>
<p>Lasiospora ispahanica, commonly known as the Persian lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate, typically found on tree bark or rock surfaces. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. Its morphology includes a leathery, dark-colored cortex with a central, lighter-colored medulla.</p>
<p>Lasiospora ispahanica is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments with moderate light exposure.</p>
