                    <h1>Lolium crassiculme</h1>
<p>Lolium crassiculme, commonly known as rigid ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly compacted, with small, two-lobed florets that are often tinged with red or purple at maturity. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is commonly found in pastures and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Lolium crassiculme is valued for its forage qualities and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
