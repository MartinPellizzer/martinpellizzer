<p>Lupinus angustifolius subvar. albosyringeus, commonly known as the white-flowered narrow-leaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in width. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are arranged in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
