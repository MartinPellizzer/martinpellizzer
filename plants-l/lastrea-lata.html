<p>Lastrea lata, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
