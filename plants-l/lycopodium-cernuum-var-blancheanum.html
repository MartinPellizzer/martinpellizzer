                    <h1>Lycopodium cernuum var. blancheanum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium cernuum var. blancheanum, commonly known as the Blancheanum clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a primitive vascular plant with ancient lineage and ecological importance in forest understories.</p>
