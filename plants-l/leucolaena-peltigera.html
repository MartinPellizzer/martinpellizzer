<p>Leucolaena peltigera, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>The silver wattle is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
