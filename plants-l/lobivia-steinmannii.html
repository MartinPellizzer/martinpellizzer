                    <h1>Lobivia steinmannii</h1>
<p>Lobivia steinmannii, commonly known as the Steinmann's lobivia, is a small, compact cactus native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring. The plant has a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species.</p>
