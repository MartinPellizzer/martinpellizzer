                            <h1>Lycianthes Actinocalyx</h1>
<p>Lycianthes actinocalyx is a lesser-known member of the nightshade family native to the humid forests of Central and South America. This small shrub is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers and edible, mildly tart fruits. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for various pollinators and wildlife. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study. However, it remains relatively obscure in the broader horticultural world.</p>
