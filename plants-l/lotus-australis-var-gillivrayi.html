<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal or sandy regions.</p>
