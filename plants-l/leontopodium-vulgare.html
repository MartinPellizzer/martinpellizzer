                    <h1>Leontopodium vulgare</h1>
<p>Leontopodium vulgare, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow bracts that surround the small yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry conditions and well-drained soil. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and alpine beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its protected status in many regions, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens rather than harvested from the wild.</p>
