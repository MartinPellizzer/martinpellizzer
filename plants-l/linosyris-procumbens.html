<p>Linosyris procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate linosyris, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a sprawling habit with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Linosyris procumbens is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
