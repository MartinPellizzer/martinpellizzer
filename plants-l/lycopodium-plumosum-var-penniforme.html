                    <h1>Lycopodium plumosum var. penniforme</h1>
<p>Lycopodium plumosum var. penniforme, commonly known as the feathery clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. Native to moist, shaded environments, it thrives in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
