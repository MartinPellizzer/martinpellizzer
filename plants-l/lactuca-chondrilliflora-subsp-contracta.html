<p>Lactuca chondrilliflora subsp.</p>
<p>contracta, commonly known as the dwarf lettuce, is a subspecies of the lettuce genus native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by hard, woody seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than other lettuces but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
