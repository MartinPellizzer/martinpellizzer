                    <h1>Lycopodium × sabinifolium var. patens</h1>
<p>Lycopodium × sabinifolium var. patens, commonly known as the running clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that produce small, scale-like leaves arranged in a dense, mat-forming structure. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are typical of the Lycopodiales order. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
