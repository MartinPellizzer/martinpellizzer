                    <h1>Lopholepis</h1>
<p>Lopholepis, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a genus of small, terrestrial ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, moss-like appearance and are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Lopholepis species typically have finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures called rhizomes. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they can grow on other plants or rocks, and they thrive in humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to their intricate structure and ecological importance, they play a significant role in maintaining the biodiversity of their habitats.</p>
