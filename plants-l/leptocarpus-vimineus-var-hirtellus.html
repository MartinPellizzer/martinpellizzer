<p>Leptocarpus vimineus var. hirtellus, commonly known as the hirtellus variant of the slender root grass, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces tiny, three-angled fruits.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its hairy surfaces, which give it its specific epithet "hirtellus.".</p>
