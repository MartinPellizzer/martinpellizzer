                    <h1>Lycopodium complanatum var. angustiramosum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium complanatum var. angustiramosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. This variety is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines and Indonesia, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait typical of its ancient lineage.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in forest undergrowth, where it contributes to the understory vegetation and plays a role in soil stabilization.</p>
