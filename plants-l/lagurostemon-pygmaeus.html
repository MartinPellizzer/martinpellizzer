                    <h1>Lagurostemon pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Lagurostemon pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf chenopod, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind or insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or saltbush habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is considered an important component of the local flora in its native range.</p>
