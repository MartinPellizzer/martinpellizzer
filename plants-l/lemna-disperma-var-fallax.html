                    <h1>Lemna disperma var. fallax</h1>
<p>Lemna disperma var. fallax, commonly known as the floating water starwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
