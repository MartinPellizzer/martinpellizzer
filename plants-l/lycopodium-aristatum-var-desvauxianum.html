<p>Lycopodium aristatum var. desvauxianum, commonly known as the velvet clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a velvety texture, and its stems are typically clustered and short. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the tips of its stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
