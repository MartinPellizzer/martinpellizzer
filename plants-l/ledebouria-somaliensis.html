<p>Ledebouria somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali bulbous plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of Somalia and is characterized by its compact, bulb-like structure. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow during the dry season. It has adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study in arid environments.</p>
