                    <h1>Limnia spathulata</h1>
<p>Limnia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf water plantain, is a wetland plant characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Limnia spathulata is valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
