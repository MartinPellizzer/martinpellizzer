                    <h1>Lepidoneuron obtusatum</h1>
<p>Lepidoneuron obtusatum, commonly known as the blunt-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense mats on the water surface or submerged substrate.</p>
<p>Lepidoneuron obtusatum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
