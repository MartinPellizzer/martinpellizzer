                    <h1>Loranthus musozensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus musozensis, commonly known as the Musozense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, sticky aril surrounding the seed.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
