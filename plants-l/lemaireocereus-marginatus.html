<p>Lemaireocereus marginatus, commonly known as the marginate cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring ribbed stems and white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
