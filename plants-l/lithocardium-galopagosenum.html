<p>Lithocardium galopagosenum, commonly known as the Galapagos lithocardium, is a rare succulent plant native to the Galapagos Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
