<p>Lisianthius jefensis, commonly known as the Jefens Island lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Jefens in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and tall, slender stems. The plant typically blooms during the late summer months, producing clusters of showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing in dense rosettes near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lisianthius jefensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
