                    <h1>Lotus atlanticus</h1>
<p>Lotus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, where it forms dense underwater meadows that provide habitat for various marine species. The plant has long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the muddy bottom. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Atlantic lotus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
