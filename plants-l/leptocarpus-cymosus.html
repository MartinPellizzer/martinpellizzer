<p>Leptocarpus cymosus, commonly known as the clustered sea bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody, creeping stems. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, often in sandy or muddy soils, and is adapted to salt spray and tidal conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Leptocarpus cymosus is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize shorelines.</p>
