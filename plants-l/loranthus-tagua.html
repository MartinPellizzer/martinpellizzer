<p>Loranthus tagua, commonly known as the ivory mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems and leaves. Its small, white or pale green flowers are often clustered, and it produces small, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus tagua plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
