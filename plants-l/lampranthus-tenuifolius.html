<p>Lampranthus tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green stems and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
