                    <h1>Lamprotis corifolia</h1>
<p>Lamprotis corifolia, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soil, and it often forms dense colonies in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lamprotis corifolia is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
