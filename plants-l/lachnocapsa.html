                    <h1>Lachnocapsa</h1>
<p>Lachnocapsa, commonly known as the "dwarf lichen," is a genus of lichens that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>These lichens are characterized by their crustose or foliose growth forms, often forming dense, compact colonies on rock surfaces or tree bark. They are typically found in temperate and boreal regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Lachnocapsa species are known for their complex chemical compositions, producing various secondary metabolites that contribute to their ecological roles.</p>
<p>Due to their slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, they are often used as bioindicators of air quality and ecological health.</p>
