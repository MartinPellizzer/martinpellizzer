<p>Leontopodium leiolepis var. crinulosum, commonly known as the Alpine edelweiss, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage and showy, yellow-centered flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations above 1,500 meters, often on rocky slopes or scree. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of alpine resilience and a protected species in many regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
