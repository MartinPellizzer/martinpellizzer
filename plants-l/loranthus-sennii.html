                    <h1>Loranthus sennii</h1>
<p>Loranthus sennii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Tectona.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in small groups. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus sennii is native to South and Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
