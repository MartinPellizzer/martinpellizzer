<p>Lophatherum gracile var. pilosulum, commonly known as the silky or hairy lemongrass, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and produces small, pale green flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to their subtle lemony scent.</p>
