<p>Lilium candidum var. purpureostriatum, commonly known as the purple-striated white lily, is a rare and ornamental variant of the white lily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white petals with distinct purple stripes, which add a unique visual appeal. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces large, showy flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers.</p>
