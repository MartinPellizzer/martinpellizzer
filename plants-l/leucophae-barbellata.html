<p>Leucophae barbellata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as agricultural fields and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
