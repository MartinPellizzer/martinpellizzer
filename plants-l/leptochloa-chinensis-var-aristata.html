                    <h1>Leptochloa chinensis var. aristata</h1>
<p>Leptochloa chinensis var. aristata, commonly known as the arrowgrass, is a perennial grass native to Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats and has slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist environments.</p>
<p>This variety is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetlands.</p>
