                    <h1>Loranthus parvifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is considered a common component of the understory in eucalyptus forests.</p>
