<p>Ligeophila unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn's ghost, is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in remote, high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiraling leaves that resemble the horn of a unicorn, giving it its mythical name. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are small and pale blue, often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Ligeophila unicornis remains a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
