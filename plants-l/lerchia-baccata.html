<p>Lerchia baccata, commonly known as the blackberry lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a dark, almost black, upper surface with a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. Its thallus is typically 1â€“5 cm in diameter and can be found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Lerchia baccata plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
