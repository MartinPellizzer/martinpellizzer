                    <h1>Lastrea similis</h1>
<p>Lastrea similis, commonly known as the common rock rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, branching stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Lastrea similis is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
