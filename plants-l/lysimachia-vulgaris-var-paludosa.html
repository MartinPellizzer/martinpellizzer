                    <h1>Lysimachia vulgaris var. paludosa</h1>
<p>Lysimachia vulgaris var. paludosa, commonly known as swamp myrtle or marsh filbert, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features spreading stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by egg-shaped, red berries. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems.</p>
