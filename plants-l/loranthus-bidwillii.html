                    <h1>Loranthus bidwillii</h1>
<p>Loranthus bidwillii, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as eucalypts.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and minerals, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries are red and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, facilitating seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native Australian forests.</p>
