<p>Lycopodium arthurii, commonly known as Arthur's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, moss-like mat. Native to the Appalachian region of the United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are clustered at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Lycopodium arthurii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
