<p>Lolium perenne var. secundum, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense turf that forms a mat-like structure, making it ideal for lawns and sports fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires moderate to high levels of sunlight.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread efficiently and establish a thick, durable sod.</p>
