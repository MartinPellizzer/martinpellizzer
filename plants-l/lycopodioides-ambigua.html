<p>Lycopodioides ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces spore-bearing strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Lycopodioides ambigua is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and habitat structure.</p>
