<p>Lygodisodea brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian star moss, is a unique and rare species of liverwort found primarily in the tropical rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate, and star-shaped thallus structure. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or decaying wood. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
