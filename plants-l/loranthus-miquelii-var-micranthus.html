<p>Loranthus miquelii var. micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>

The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow, containing adhesive seeds that aid in dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in forest canopies.</p>
