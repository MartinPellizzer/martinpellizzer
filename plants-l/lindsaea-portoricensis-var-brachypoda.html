                    <h1>Lindsaea portoricensis var. brachypoda</h1>
<p>Lindsaea portoricensis var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, clustered arrangement of pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
