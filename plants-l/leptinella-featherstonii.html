<p>Leptinella featherstonii, commonly known as the Stewart's lepidote, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
