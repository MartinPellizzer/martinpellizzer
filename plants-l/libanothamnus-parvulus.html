<p>Libanothamnus parvulus, commonly known as the small-flowered thamnus, is a small, mat-forming shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Libanothamnus parvulus is often found in rocky soils and is a component of desert and semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
