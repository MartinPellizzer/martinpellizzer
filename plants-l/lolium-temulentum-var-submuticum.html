<p>Lolium temulentum var. submuticum, commonly known as the soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
