<p>Lindsaea imrayana, commonly known as the Imrayana fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lindsaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Lindsaea imrayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
