                    <h1>Lupinus scaposus</h1>
<p>Lupinus scaposus, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Lupinus scaposus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
