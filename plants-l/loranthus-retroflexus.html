                    <h1>Loranthus retroflexus</h1>
<p>Loranthus retroflexus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing host tree health and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The berries are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
