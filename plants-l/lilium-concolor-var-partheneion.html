                    <h1>Lilium concolor var. partheneion</h1>
<p>Lilium concolor var. partheneion, commonly known as the Partheneion lily, is a rare and striking variant of the white lily native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored, often slightly pinkish, flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that are highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists. It is adapted to cold, moist environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
