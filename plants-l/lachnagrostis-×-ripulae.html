<p>Lachnagrostis × ripulae, commonly known as the hybrid tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy.</p>
