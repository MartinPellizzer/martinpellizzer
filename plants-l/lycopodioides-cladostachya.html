<p>Lycopodioides cladostachya, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a sporophyte that typically grows in dense, low mats. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, with the sporangia clustered in strobili at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
