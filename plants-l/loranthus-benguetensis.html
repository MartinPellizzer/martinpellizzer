                    <h1>Loranthus benguetensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus benguetensis, commonly known as the Benguet mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while performing photosynthesis to some extent. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. It plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
