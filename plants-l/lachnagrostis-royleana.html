<p>Lachnagrostis royleana, commonly known as the Kashmir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Lachnagrostis royleana plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude areas and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
