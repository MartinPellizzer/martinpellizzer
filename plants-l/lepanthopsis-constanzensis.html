                    <h1>Lepanthopsis constanzensis</h1>
<p>Lepanthopsis constanzensis, commonly known as the Constanzense orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces raceme-like inflorescences with multiple small, showy flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
