                    <h1>Lycopodium repens</h1>
<p>Lycopodium repens, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with multiple stolons that root at the nodes. The plant produces tiny, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the sporangia for spore dispersal. Lycopodium repens typically grows in dense mats, forming a lush carpet on forest floors or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
