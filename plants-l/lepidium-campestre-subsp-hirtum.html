<p>Lepidium campestre subsp.</p>
<p>hirtum, commonly known as hairy field cress, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing stature, with hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
