<p>Lobivia tiegeliana var. uriondoensis, commonly known as the Uriondo lobivia, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and spines that are typically reddish or brown. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a vibrant contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is highly valued by collectors for its unique appearance and limited distribution.</p>
