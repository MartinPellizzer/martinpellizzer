                    <h1>Leucopogon glabellus var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Leucopogon glabellus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leucopogon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in wetland or swampy environments. Its hairy stems and leaves distinguish this variant from the typical form of Leucopogon glabellus.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects.</p>
