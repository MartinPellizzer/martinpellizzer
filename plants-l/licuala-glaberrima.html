                    <h1>Licuala glaberrima</h1>
<p>Licuala glaberrima, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, and it is dioecious, meaning male and female plants are separate. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens.</p>
