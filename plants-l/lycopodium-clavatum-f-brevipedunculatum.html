                    <h1>Lycopodium clavatum f. brevipedunculatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium clavatum f. brevipedunculatum, commonly known as the short-stalked clubmoss, is a rare and compact variant of the common clubmoss.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, clustered stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, moss-like tufts. This fern ally belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
