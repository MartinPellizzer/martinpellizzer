<p>Lycopodium obscurum f. breve, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the base of the stems. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This form is a naturally occurring variant of Lycopodium obscurum, distinguished by its compact size and dense foliage.</p>
