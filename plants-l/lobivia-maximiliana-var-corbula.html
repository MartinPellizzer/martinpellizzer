<p>Lobivia maximiliana var. corbula, commonly known as the "Coral Lobivia," is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, rib-like structures that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months.
