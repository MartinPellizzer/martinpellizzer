                    <h1>Lupinus toratensis</h1>
<p>Lupinus toratensis, commonly known as the Toratensian lupin, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy bristles. Lupinus toratensis is adapted to harsh, arid environments and has developed mechanisms to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role as a nitrogen-fixing plant, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
