<p>Leucadendron eucalyptifolium, commonly known as the silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its striking cone-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange.

It produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
