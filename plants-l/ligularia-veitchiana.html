                    <h1>Ligularia veitchiana</h1>
<p>Ligularia veitchiana, commonly known as the Veitch's ligularia, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often green with a reddish or bronze edge. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes primarily from its striking foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
