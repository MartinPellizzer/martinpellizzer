<p>Laphamia dura, commonly known as the hardy lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form. This lichen is typically found on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces in arid or semi-arid regions. Its ability to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture makes it a resilient organism in ecological systems.</p>
<p>The botanical study of Laphamia dura provides insights into lichen symbiosis and adaptation to extreme habitats.</p>
