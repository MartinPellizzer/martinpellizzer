<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in moist soils along streambanks and wetlands, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pinnatisect leaf structure, which sets it apart from other lepidium species.</p>
