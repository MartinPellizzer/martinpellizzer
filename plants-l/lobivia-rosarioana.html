<p>Lobivia rosarioana, commonly known as the Rosarioana Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Andes Mountains of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It features a dense, spiny crown with short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the top of the plant. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
