                    <h1>Loranthus rhododendricola</h1>
<p>Loranthus rhododendricola, commonly known as the red-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of rhododendrons.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its green stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of Asia, including China and India, where it thrives in humid, forested environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can impact the health of its host plant, making it an important subject in ecological studies.</p>
