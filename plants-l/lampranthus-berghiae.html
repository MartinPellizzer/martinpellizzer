                    <h1>Lampranthus berghiae</h1>
<p>Lampranthus berghiae, commonly known as the Cape gold plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange to yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lampranthus berghiae is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
