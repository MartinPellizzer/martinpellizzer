                    <h1>Lepanthes necae</h1>
<p>Lepanthes necae, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the wetlands of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and leaves that resemble leaves of the bromeliad family. The plant typically grows on trees or in moist, shaded environments, often without soil, relying on its host for nutrients. Its flowers are small and delicate, usually appearing in clusters during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is highly sought after in conservation efforts and botanical collections.</p>
