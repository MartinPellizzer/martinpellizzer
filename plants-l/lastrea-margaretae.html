<p>Lastrea margaretae, commonly known as the Margaretae Lastrea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, which help minimize water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Lastrea margaretae is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
