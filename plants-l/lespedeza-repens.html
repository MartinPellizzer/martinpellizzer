                    <h1>Lespedeza repens</h1>
<p>Lespedeza repens, commonly known as prostrate lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, branching stems that often lie flat on the soil surface. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>Lespedeza repens is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
