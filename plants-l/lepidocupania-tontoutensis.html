                    <h1>Lepidocupania tontoutensis</h1>
<p>Lepidocupania tontoutensis, commonly known as the Tontouta fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often covered in fine, scale-like projections. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky surfaces or in the understory of dense vegetation. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in Madagascar.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial due to its vulnerability to habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
