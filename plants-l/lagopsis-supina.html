                    <h1>Lagopsis supina</h1>
<p>Lagopsis supina, commonly known as the prostrate lagopsis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, hairy stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Lagopsis supina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
