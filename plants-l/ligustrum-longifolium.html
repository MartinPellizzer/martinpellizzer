<p>Ligustrum longifolium, commonly known as the European privet, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate various soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>
