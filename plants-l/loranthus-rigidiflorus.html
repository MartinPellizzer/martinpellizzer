                    <h1>Loranthus rigidiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus rigidiflorus, commonly known as the rigid-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks and other hardwoods.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is native to the southeastern United States and is often found in forested areas where its host trees are abundant.</p>
