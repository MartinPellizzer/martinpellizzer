<p>Lastrea repens, commonly known as the creeping lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that grow prostrate along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Lastrea repens is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
