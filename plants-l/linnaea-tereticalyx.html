                    <h1>Linnaea tereticalyx</h1>
<p>Linnaea tereticalyx, commonly known as the silverleaf twinflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate forests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing near streams or in woodland undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linnaea tereticalyx is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
