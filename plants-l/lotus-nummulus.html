                    <h1>Lotus nummulus</h1>
<p>Lotus nummulus, commonly known as the small lotus or the nummular lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant features floating leaves that are round and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>The root system of Lotus nummulus is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in muddy substrates while supporting its buoyant foliage.</p>
