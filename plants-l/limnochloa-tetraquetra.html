<p>Limnochloa tetraquetra, commonly known as the New Zealand water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, forming dense mats. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in ponds or lakes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Limnochloa tetraquetra plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by reducing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
