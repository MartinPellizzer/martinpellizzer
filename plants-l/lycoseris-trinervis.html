<p>Lycoseris trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined lycoperd, is a species of fungus in the family Lycoperdaceae.</p>
<p>It is a saprophytic fungus that decomposes organic matter, primarily found in forested areas. The fruiting body of Lycoseris trinervis is small and typically has a cap that is initially white but turns yellowish with age. It produces spores in a volva, which is a distinctive, cup-like structure at the base of the stem.</p>
<p>This fungus is often mistaken for other similar species due to its subtle morphological features.</p>
