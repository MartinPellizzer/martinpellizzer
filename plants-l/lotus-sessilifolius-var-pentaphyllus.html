                    <h1>Lotus sessilifolius var. pentaphyllus</h1>
<p>Lotus sessilifolius var. pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-leaf water lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots system helps stabilize the sediment in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
