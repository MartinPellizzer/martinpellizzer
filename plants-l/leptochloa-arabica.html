<p>Leptochloa arabica, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Leptochloa arabica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats.</p>
