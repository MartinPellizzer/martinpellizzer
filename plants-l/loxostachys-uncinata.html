                    <h1>Loxostachys uncinata</h1>
<p>Loxostachys uncinata, commonly known as the hairy spiny grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bract-like structures that bear the flowering heads. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Loxostachys uncinata is adapted to low rainfall and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
