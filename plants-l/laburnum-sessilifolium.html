                    <h1>Laburnum sessilifolium</h1>
<p>Laburnum sessilifolium, commonly known as the golden chain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>Laburnum sessilifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in gardens and along roadsides.</p>
