                    <h1>Lythrum subhastatum</h1>
<p>Lythrum subhastatum, commonly known as purple loosestrife, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, ditches, and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
