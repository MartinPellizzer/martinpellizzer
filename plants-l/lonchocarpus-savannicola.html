                    <h1>Lonchocarpus savannicola</h1>
<p>Lonchocarpus savannicola, commonly known as the savanna legume, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, thanks to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody pod, which helps in seed dispersal and survival in harsh environments.</p>
