<p>Lepidomicrosorium ningpoense, commonly known as the Ningpo water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of the Marsileaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
