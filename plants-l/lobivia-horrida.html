                    <h1>Lobivia horrida</h1>
<p>Lobivia horrida, commonly known as the horrid lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Lobivia horrida is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
