                    <h1>Loranthus angustifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various parts of Australia and is an important component of the ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
