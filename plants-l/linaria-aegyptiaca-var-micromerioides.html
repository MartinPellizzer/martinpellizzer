                    <h1>Linaria aegyptiaca var. micromerioides</h1>
<p>Linaria aegyptiaca var. micromerioides, commonly known as the dwarf Egyptian toadflax, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces vibrant yellow-orange flowers in racemes during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This variety is a smaller form of the species, with shorter stems and smaller flowers compared to the typical Linaria aegyptiaca.</p>
