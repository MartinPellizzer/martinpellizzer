                    <h1>Linanthus bigelovii</h1>
<p>Linanthus bigelovii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Linanthus bigelovii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
