                    <h1>Loranthus pennatulus</h1>
<p>Loranthus pennatulus, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It primarily parasitizes members of the Eucalyptus genus, drawing water and nutrients from the host while also photosynthesizing using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Loranthus pennatulus make it an important component of the ecological dynamics in its native Australian habitats.</p>
