                    <h1>Lyonia maritima</h1>
<p>Lyonia maritima, commonly known as salt marsh dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, such as tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline conditions. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Lyonia maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
