                    <h1>Lichtensteinia globosa</h1>
<p>Lichtensteinia globosa, commonly known as the globular lichen, is a species of lichen that forms a dense, cushion-like growth.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange coloration, which is due to the presence of secondary metabolites. This lichen thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rock surfaces or soil in regions with low humidity. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>Lichtensteinia globosa plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
