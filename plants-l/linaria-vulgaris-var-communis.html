<p>Linaria vulgaris var. communis, commonly known as common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble small toads, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Linaria vulgaris var. communis is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
