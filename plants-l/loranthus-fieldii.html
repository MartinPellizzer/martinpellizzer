                    <h1>Loranthus fieldii</h1>
<p>Loranthus fieldii, commonly known as the fieldâ€™s mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds. It is found in various parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked.</p>
