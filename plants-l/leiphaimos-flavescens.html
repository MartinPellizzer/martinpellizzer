<p>Leiphaimos flavescens, commonly known as the golden leiphaimos, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
