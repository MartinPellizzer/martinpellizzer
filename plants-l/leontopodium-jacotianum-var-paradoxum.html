                    <h1>Leontopodium jacotianum var. paradoxum</h1>
<p>Leontopodium jacotianum var. paradoxum, commonly known as the paradoxical edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a central cluster of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to climate change, it is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
