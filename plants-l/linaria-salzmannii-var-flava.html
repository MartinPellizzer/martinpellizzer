                    <h1>Linaria salzmannii var. flava</h1>
<p>Linaria salzmannii var. flava, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
