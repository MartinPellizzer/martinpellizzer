<p>Lupinus decumbens var. argentatus, commonly known as silver lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The silver lupine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
