<p>Lactuca terrae-novae, commonly known as the Newfangled Lettuce, is a rare species native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crisp, pale green leaves with a slightly bitter taste, similar to other lettuces in the Lactuca genus. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small, yellow, and inconspicuous, appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
