                    <h1>Launaea pulchra</h1>
<p>Launaea pulchra, commonly known as the silverleaf cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by cylindrical fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Launaea pulchra is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
