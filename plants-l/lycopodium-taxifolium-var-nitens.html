<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shiny, smooth leaves, which give it its common name.</p>
