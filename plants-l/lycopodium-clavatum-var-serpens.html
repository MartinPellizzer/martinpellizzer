                    <h1>Lycopodium clavatum var. serpens</h1>
<p>Lycopodium clavatum var. serpens, commonly known as the ground pine, is a clubmoss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and its ability to form extensive colonies. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in woodland settings.</p>
