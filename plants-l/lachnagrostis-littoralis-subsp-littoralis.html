<p>Lachnagrostis littoralis subsp.</p>
<p>littoralis, commonly known as the coastal hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, tufted blades that are often covered in short, silky hairs.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal and estuarine environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
<p>Its flowering spikes are typically inconspicuous, with small, wind-pollinated flowers that contribute to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems.</p>
