                    <h1>Loranthus brunneus var. thonneri</h1>
<p>Loranthus brunneus var. thonneri, commonly known as the Thonner's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
