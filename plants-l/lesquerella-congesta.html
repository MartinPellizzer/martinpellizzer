<p>Lesquerella congesta, commonly known as the desert lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it has adapted to survive with minimal water. Lesquerella congesta produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
