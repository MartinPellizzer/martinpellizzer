<p>Leptodermis diffusa, commonly known as the slender skin fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, oval-shaped spore-bearing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Leptodermis diffusa make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
