<p>Lobivia chrysantha var. klusacekii, commonly known as the Klusacek's lobivia, is a compact, branching cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, with a powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is highly valued by cactus enthusiasts and collectors.</p>
