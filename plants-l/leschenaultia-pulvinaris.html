                    <h1>Leschenaultia pulvinaris</h1>
<p>Leschenaultia pulvinaris, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Leschenaultia pulvinaris is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
