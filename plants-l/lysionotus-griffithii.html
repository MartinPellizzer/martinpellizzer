                    <h1>Lysionotus griffithii</h1>
<p>Lysionotus griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has thin, fibrous roots and produces showy, fragrant blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
