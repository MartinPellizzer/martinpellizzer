                    <h1>Lycopodium alticola</h1>
<p>Lycopodium alticola, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium alticola thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
