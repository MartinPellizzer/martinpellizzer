                    <h1>Limonium vulgare</h1>
<p>Limonium vulgare, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal meadows. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh maritime environments.</p>
<p>Limonium vulgare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dried floral arrangements.</p>
