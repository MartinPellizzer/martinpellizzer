<p>Loxogramme abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a rosette shape, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that aid in light absorption and gas exchange. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
