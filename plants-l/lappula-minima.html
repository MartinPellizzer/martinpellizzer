                    <h1>Lappula minima</h1>
<p>Lappula minima, commonly known as the lesser lappula, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a low, spreading growth habit. The plant features small, lobed leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its seeds are contained in a beak-like capsule, which aids in dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>Lappula minima is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
