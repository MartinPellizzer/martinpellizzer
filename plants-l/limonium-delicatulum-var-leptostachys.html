<p>Limonium delicatulum var. leptostachys, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters atop slender, branching stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
