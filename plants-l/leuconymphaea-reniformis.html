<p>Leuconymphaea reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, floating fronds that are typically broad and reniform (kidney-shaped), giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually light green and can range in size, contributing to the plant's aesthetic appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>
