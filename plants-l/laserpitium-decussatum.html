                    <h1>Laserpitium decussatum</h1>
<p>Laserpitium decussatum, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, blue-green foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
