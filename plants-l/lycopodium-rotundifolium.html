<p>Lycopodium rotundifolium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage is relatively short-lived, with the gametophyte stage being more prominent in its life cycle.</p>
<p>Lycopodium rotundifolium plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
