                    <h1>Lennoa madreporoides var. caerulea</h1>
<p>Lennoa madreporoides var. caerulea, commonly known as the blue-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant blue petals and a compact, pseudobulbous structure typical of many orchids. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
