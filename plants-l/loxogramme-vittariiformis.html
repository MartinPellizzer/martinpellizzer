<p>Loxogramme vittariiformis, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to various regions in Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, forming dense mats that can help stabilize sediment.</p>
<p>Loxogramme vittariiformis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
