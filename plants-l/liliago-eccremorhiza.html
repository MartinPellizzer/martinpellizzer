                    <h1>Liliago eccremorhiza</h1>
<p>Liliago eccremorhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
