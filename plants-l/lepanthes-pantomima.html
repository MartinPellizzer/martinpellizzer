                    <h1>Lepanthes pantomima</h1>
<p>Lepanthes pantomima, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and well-drained substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lepanthes pantomima is highly sought after in conservation efforts.</p>
