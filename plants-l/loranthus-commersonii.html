                    <h1>Loranthus commersonii</h1>
<p>Loranthus commersonii, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water directly from the host through its haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds.</p>
<p>Loranthus commersonii is native to various regions in South America and is often found in forested areas.</p>
