                    <h1>Lepidomicrosorium subhastatum</h1>
<p>Lepidomicrosorium subhastatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette structure, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and ditches, where it can receive adequate sunlight for photosynthesis. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into fruits containing single seeds.</p>
<p>Lepidomicrosorium subhastatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
