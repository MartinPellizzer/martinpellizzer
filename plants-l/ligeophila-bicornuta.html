<p>Ligeophila bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
