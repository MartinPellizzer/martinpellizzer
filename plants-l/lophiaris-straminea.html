                    <h1>Lophiaris straminea</h1>
<p>Lophiaris straminea, commonly known as the yellow lophiaris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil.</p>
