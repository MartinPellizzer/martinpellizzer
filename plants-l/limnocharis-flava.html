                    <h1>Limnocharis flava</h1>
<p>Limnocharis flava, commonly known as the golden water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, and its leaves are broad, floating, and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction, forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions.</p>
