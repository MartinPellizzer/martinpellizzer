<p>Linaria rytidosperma, commonly known as the silverleaf toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine, silver hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Linaria rytidosperma is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to survive in harsh, semi-arid environments.</p>
