                    <h1>Loranthus curvirameus</h1>
<p>Loranthus curvirameus, commonly known as the curved-stem mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches to its host trees, typically in the genus Ficus, through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus curvirameus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits, though it can be considered a parasitic weed in some contexts.</p>
