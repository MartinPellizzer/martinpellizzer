<p>Linkia falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed kikar, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and narrow, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Linkia falcata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
