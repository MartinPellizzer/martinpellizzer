                    <h1>Loeseneriella crenata var. loandensis</h1>
<p>Loeseneriella crenata var. loandensis, commonly known as the Loandensian crenate fern, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, crenate (notched) leaf margins and a compact, low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
