                    <h1>Lantana aculeata f. varia</h1>
<p>Lantana aculeata f. varia, commonly known as the variegated lantana, is a flowering shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange and red. The leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>
