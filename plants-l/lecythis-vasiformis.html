<p>Lecythis vasiformis, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk that resembles a bottle, which stores water and helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces large, palmate leaves and is known for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance. It also bears yellow flowers followed by woody fruits containing edible seeds.</p>
<p>The tree is valued in traditional medicine and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens.</p>
