                    <h1>Lumnitzera racemosa var. racemosa</h1>
<p>Lumnitzera racemosa var. racemosa, commonly known as the mangrove buttonwood, is a halophytic species native to tropical coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal zones. The plant has prop roots that extend from its trunk, providing structural support and facilitating oxygen exchange in waterlogged soils. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically greenish-white, and it produces woody fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
