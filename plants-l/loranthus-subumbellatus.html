                    <h1>Loranthus subumbellatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus subumbellatus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially damaging to its host trees.</p>
