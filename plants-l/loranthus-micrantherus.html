                    <h1>Loranthus micrantherus</h1>
<p>Loranthus micrantherus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in association with various hardwood trees.</p>
