                    <h1>Leighia nonneaefolia</h1>
<p>Leighia nonneaefolia, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has short, fleshy roots and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its pseudobulbs for water storage. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
