                    <h1>Lithocardium fulvosum</h1>
<p>Lithocardium fulvosum, commonly known as the yellow stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense clusters atop the stems. Lithocardium fulvosum is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
