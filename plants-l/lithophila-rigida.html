                    <h1>Lithophila rigida</h1>
<p>Lithophila rigida, commonly known as the rigid lithophyte, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, and it produces small, white or pink flowers during the warmer months. Lithophila rigida is often found in crevices or on cliffs, where it can anchor itself with its fibrous roots.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it well-suited for survival in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
