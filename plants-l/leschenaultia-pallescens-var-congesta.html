<p>Leschenaultia pallescens var. congesta, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
