                    <h1>Lepisorus loriformis f. steniste</h1>
<p>Lepisorus loriformis f. steniste, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a rare fern species characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>It features elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a dense arrangement that gives it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found on rocky or shaded forest floors. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
