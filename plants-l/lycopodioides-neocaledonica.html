                    <h1>Lycopodioides neocaledonica</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, moss-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila, typical of lycophytes. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant evolution and adaptation.</p>
