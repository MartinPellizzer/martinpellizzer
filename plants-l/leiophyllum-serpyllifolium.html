                    <h1>Leiophyllum serpyllifolium</h1>
<p>Leiophyllum serpyllifolium, commonly known as creeping rock-rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
