<p>Leucheria salinae subsp.</p>
<p>zollneri, commonly known as the Zollner's sea hibiscus, is a rare coastal plant native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in saline environments, often found along rocky shores and tidal zones. Its adaptability to salt spray and well-drained soils makes it a unique example of halophytic flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
