                    <h1>Lythrum salicaria subvar. genuinum</h1>
<p>Lythrum salicaria subvar. genuinum, commonly known as purple loosestrife, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of vibrant purple to pink flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and along streams.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and prolific seed production have made it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
