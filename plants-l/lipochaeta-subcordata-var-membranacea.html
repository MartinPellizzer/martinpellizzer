<p>Lipochaeta subcordata var. membranacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
