<p>Laelia crispa var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed laelia, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its high-altitude, cool climate. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its beauty and adaptability to cultivation.</p>
