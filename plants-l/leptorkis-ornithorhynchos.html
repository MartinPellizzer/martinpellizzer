<p>Leptorkis ornithorhynchos, commonly known as the bird-beak fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and elongated fronds that resemble a bird's beak.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
