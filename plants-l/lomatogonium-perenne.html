<p>Lomatogonium perenne, commonly known as the everlasting dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures, aiding in its spread. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Lomatogonium perenne is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a hardy, long-lived perennial.</p>
