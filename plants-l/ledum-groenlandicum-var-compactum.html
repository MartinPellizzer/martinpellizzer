                    <h1>Ledum groenlandicum var. compactum</h1>
<p>Ledum groenlandicum var. compactum, commonly known as dwarf Labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, dark green, leathery leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and heathland ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit compared to the typical Labrador tea.</p>
