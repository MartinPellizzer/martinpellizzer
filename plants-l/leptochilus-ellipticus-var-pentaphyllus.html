                    <h1>Leptochilus ellipticus var. pentaphyllus</h1>
<p>Leptochilus ellipticus var. pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-leafed water clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that often form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically arranged in a five-leaf cluster, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other members of the Apiaceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological traits.</p>
