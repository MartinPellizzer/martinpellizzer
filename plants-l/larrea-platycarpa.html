                <h1>Larrea platycarpa</h1>
<p>Larrea platycarpa, commonly known as desert whitethorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zygophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. Its extensive root system allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and withstand extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Larrea platycarpa plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
