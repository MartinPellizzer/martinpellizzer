<p>Lycopodium turbinatum, commonly known as the turbinated clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance, characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. Lycopodium turbinatum produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are often clustered at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>This plant is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and its role in ecological systems.</p>
