<p>Linaria lurida, commonly known as the desert toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Linaria lurida is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
