<p>Lannea multijuga, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, semi-deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
