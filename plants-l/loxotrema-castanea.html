                    <h1>Loxotrema castanea</h1>
<p>Loxotrema castanea, commonly known as the chestnut tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that grows on tree bark, particularly on chestnut trees.</p>
<p>It has a dark green to blackish upper surface with a powdery coating and a lighter, leathery underside. The thallus is composed of a complex interwoven network of hyphae, and it lacks distinct lobes or leaf-like structures. It is often found in temperate regions and is associated with specific host trees.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its environment.</p>
