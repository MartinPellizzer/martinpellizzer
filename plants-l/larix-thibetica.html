                    <h1>Larix thibetica</h1>
<p>Larix thibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan larch, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deciduous needles, which turn golden in autumn before falling off, and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is often found in forest ecosystems at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. Its wood is strong and lightweight, making it valuable for construction and crafting.</p>
<p>Larix thibetica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species.</p>
