                    <h1>Lachnaea buxifolia var. virens</h1>
<p>Lachnaea buxifolia var. virens, commonly known as the green-leaved boxleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like thallus with a smooth, bright green upper surface and a darker, more textured underside. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found growing on bark, soil, or rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
