<p>Leutea sclerophylla, commonly known as the rough leaved rock heath, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as part of native plant gardens.</p>
