                    <h1>Leiphaimos</h1>
<p>Leiphaimos, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant's leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Leiphaimos thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its rare ability to produce light through a specialized chemical reaction in its petals.</p>
