                    <h1>Lantana × paraensis</h1>
<p>Lantana × paraensis, commonly known as the yellow lantana, is a hybrid shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically yellow or orange, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction.</p>
