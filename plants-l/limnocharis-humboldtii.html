                    <h1>Limnocharis humboldtii</h1>
<p>Limnocharis humboldtii, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has soft, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, and its rapid growth can lead to dense populations.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a nuisance in non-native regions.</p>
