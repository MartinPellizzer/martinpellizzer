                    <h1>Leochilus gracilis</h1>
<p>Leochilus gracilis, commonly known as the slender leechwort, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Leochilus gracilis is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes used in ecological studies to assess soil health and biodiversity.</p>
