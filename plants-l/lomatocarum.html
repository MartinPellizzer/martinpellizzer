                    <h1>Lomatocarum</h1>
<p>Lomatocarum, commonly known as desert sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Lomatocarum species typically have small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, or white.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
