<p>Lastreopsis velutina, commonly known as the velvet lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety thallus that gives it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
