<p>Lycopodium papillatum, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Lycopodium papillatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover.</p>
