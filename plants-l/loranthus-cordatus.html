                    <h1>Loranthus cordatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus cordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to cordate in shape, giving it its common name, and it is often found in coastal and temperate regions.</p>
<p>Loranthus cordatus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various birds and insects.</p>
