<p>Lobivia scopulina, commonly known as the rock lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the blooming season. Its leaves are typically small and spiny, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Lobivia scopulina thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
