                    <h1>Leptocarpus rigidus</h1>
<p>Leptocarpus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to coastal conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
