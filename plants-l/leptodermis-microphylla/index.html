                            <h1>Leptodermis Microphylla</h1>
<p>Small-leaved rock heath, scientifically known as Leptodermis microphylla, is a resilient plant species that thrives in harsh, rocky environments. It is native to regions with extreme climates, where it adapts to poor soil and limited water availability. This low-growing shrub is characterized by its tiny, leathery leaves and clusters of small, often pale flowers. Despite its delicate appearance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its unique adaptations make it an important subject for botanical and ecological studies.</p>
