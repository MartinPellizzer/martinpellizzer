<p>Lithophragma glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous rock-avens, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant produces underground bulbs, which help it survive in harsh, rocky environments. Its leaves are typically evergreen, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
