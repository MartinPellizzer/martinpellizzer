                    <h1>Loranthus ritozanensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus ritozanensis, commonly known as the Ritozanese mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, deriving some nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Loranthus ritozanensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
