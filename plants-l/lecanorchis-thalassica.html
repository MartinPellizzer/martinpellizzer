                    <h1>Lecanorchis thalassica</h1>
<p>Lecanorchis thalassica, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to bluish-green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near the coast, often growing on rocks or in moist, sandy soils. Its unique adaptation to coastal conditions includes a specialized root system that helps it retain moisture in saline environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
