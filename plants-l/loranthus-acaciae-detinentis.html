                    <h1>Loranthus acaciae-detinentis</h1>
<p>Loranthus acaciae-detinentis, commonly known as the acacia dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of acacia trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Africa and Australia.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic relationship with acacia species and its role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
