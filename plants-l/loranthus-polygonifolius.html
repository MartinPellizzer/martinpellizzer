                    <h1>Loranthus polygonifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus polygonifolius, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to China and is often found growing on various hardwood trees.</p>
