                    <h1>Lessingia glandulifera var. pectinata</h1>
<p>Lessingia glandulifera var. pectinata, commonly known as the glandular lessingia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, pinkish to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are often covered with tiny glands that produce a sticky substance, which may help in water retention.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other species in the Lessingia genus, which are known for their ecological importance in arid environments.</p>
