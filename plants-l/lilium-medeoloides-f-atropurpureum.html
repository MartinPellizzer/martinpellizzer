                    <h1>Lilium medeoloides f. atropurpureum</h1>
<p>Lilium medeoloides f. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-flowered death lily, is a striking variant of the death lily species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black flowers, which contrast sharply with its grass-like foliage. This perennial plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Its unique coloration and ecological role make it a notable subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
