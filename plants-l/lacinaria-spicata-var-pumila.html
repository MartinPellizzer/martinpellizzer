                    <h1>Lacinaria spicata var. pumila</h1>
<p>Lacinaria spicata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spiky lichen, is a unique plant characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive spiky structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with algae, which contributes to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. Its morphology includes a dense, mat-like thallus with short, erect lobes that give it a spiky appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and adaptability to humid, temperate climates.</p>
