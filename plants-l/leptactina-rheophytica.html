                    <h1>Leptactina rheophytica</h1>
<p>Leptactina rheophytica, commonly known as the stream fern, is a rare aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that help reduce water resistance in its flowing habitat. The plant thrives in cool, well-oxygenated waters and is often anchored to rocks or submerged substrates. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water currents, ensuring propagation in its dynamic environment.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for healthy aquatic ecosystems.</p>
