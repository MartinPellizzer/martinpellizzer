                    <h1>Loranthus ceciliae</h1>
<p>Loranthus ceciliae, commonly known as the Cecilia's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds to new host trees.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
