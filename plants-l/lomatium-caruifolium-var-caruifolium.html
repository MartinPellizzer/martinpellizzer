                    <h1>Lomatium caruifolium var. caruifolium</h1>
<p>Lomatium caruifolium var. caruifolium, commonly known as the western lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces umbel-like inflorescences with small, yellowish flowers in the spring. Its leaves and stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This species is often found in dry meadows and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
