<p>Lavatera arborea var. berlengensis, commonly known as the Berlingensis Lavatera, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Berlinga in the Azores.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant produces fluffy, spherical seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation across the island's rugged terrain. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
