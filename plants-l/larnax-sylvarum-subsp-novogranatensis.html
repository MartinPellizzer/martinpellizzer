<p>Larnax sylvarum subsp.</p>
<p>novogranatensis, commonly known as the Greater Mountain Larnax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are pubescent on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
