The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
