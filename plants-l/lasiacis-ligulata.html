<p>Lasiacis ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a dense cluster. The plant is typically found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Lasiacis ligulata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
