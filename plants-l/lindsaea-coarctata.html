                    <h1>Lindsaea coarctata</h1>
<p>Lindsaea coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a dark green color with a glossy texture. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Lindsaea coarctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments.</p>
