<p>Lightfootia tenella var. diffusa, commonly known as the variegated lightfootia, is a compact, trailing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow and white markings, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its variegation.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a tabletop plant.</p>
