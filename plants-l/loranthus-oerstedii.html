                    <h1>Loranthus oerstedii</h1>
<p>Loranthus oerstedii, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and hickories.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to the southeastern United States and is often found in forested areas.</p>
