<p>Leptochilus macrophyllus var. pedunculatus, commonly known as the large-leafed leptochilus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, slender peduncles. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is considered a valuable species for wetland restoration projects.</p>
