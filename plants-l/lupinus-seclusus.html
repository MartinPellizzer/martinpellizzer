                    <h1>Lupinus seclusus</h1>
<p>Lupinus seclusus, commonly known as the hidden lupine, is a rare and elusive member of the legume family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and feathery leaves, typical of many lupine species. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its unique morphology includes a taproot system that allows it to access deep soil moisture.</p>
<p>Lupinus seclusus plays a vital role in soil enrichment through its nitrogen-fixing abilities.</p>
