                    <h1>Lobaria</h1>
<p>Lobaria, commonly known as the "liverworts," is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, lobed thallus, which is typically attached to rocks or trees through a basal holdfast. Lobaria species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or cliff faces. They play an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and habitat preferences make them valuable indicators of environmental conditions.</p>
