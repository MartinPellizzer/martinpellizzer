                    <h1>Lycopodium flabelliforme var. ambiguum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium flabelliforme var. ambiguum, commonly known as the variable clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls along its branching stems.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a strobilus, which contains the sporangia for spore production. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The varietal name "ambiguum" reflects the variability in its morphological features, making it a subject of taxonomic interest.</p>
