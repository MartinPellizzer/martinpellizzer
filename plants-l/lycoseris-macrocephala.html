                    <h1>Lycoseris macrocephala</h1>
<p>Lycoseris macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed lycoperd, is a species of puffball fungus belonging to the family Lycoperdaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spherical fruiting body that typically measures between 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter. The outer surface is initially covered with a dense layer of spore-bearing cells, which later become smooth as the spores are released. It thrives in grassy areas and is often found in disturbed soils, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This fungus is notable for its lack of a stem and its ability to produce spores in a single, massive release.</p>
