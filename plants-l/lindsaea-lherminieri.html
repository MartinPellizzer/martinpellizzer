<p>Lindsaea lherminieri, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Lherminieri is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
