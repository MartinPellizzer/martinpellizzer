                    <h1>Litobrochia montbrisonis</h1>
<p>Litobrochia montbrisonis, commonly known as the Montbrison stone lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pertusariaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to rock surfaces. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor, high-altitude habitats. It is often found on limestone or sandstone substrates in mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological monitoring.</p>
