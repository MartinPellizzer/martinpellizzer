                    <h1>Limonium salsuginosum</h1>
<p>Limonium salsuginosum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and salt-tolerant nature, which allows it to thrive in saline environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered blooms that attract pollinators. It is often found in dunes and coastal sands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Limonium salsuginosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to grow in challenging, coastal conditions.</p>
