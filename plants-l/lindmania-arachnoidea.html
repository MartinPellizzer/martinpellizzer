<p>Lindmania arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-plant or spider fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to South America.</p>

The plant has a short, stout rhizome with dense clusters of small, spore-producing structures called sorus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Lindmania arachnoidea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and air-purifying qualities.</p>
