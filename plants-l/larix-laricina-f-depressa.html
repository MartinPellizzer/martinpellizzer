                    <h1>Larix laricina f. depressa</h1>
<p>Larix laricina f. depressa, commonly known as the creeping larch, is a low-growing variant of the tamarack tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in wet, boggy environments. The plant features needle-like leaves that are typically green in summer and turn golden in autumn. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh northern climates and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
