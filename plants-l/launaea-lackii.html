<p>Launaea lackii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Launaea lackii is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
