                    <h1>Lepanthes insolita</h1>
<p>Lepanthes insolita, commonly known as the rare orchid of the Neotropical region, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, often in the Caribbean and Central America. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepanthes insolita is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
