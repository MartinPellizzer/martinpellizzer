<p>Lepicephalus ustulatus, commonly known as the fireblot fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and moderate temperatures. Its reproductive structures are unique, with spore-producing capsules that develop on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lepicephalus ustulatus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
