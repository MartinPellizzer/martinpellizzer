                    <h1>Lygodium hians</h1>
<p>Lygodium hians, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern species characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant's rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Its unique growth habit involves climbing and twining around supports, which aids in its spread.</p>
<p>The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
