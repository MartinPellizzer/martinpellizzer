<p>Lycopersicon esculentum subsp.</p>
<p>humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt tomato, is a botanical variant of the domesticated tomato. It is characterized by its small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow in color.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It exhibits a more wild morphology compared to cultivated tomatoes, with hairy stems and smaller leaves.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs to improve resilience in tomato crops.</p>
