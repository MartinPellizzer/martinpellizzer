                    <h1>Lotus lancerottensis var. villosa</h1>
<p>Lotus lancerottensis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to the volcanic soil and high-altitude conditions make it a subject of interest for botanists studying xerophytic flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
