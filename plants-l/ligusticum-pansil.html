                    <h1>Ligusticum pansil</h1>
<p>Ligusticum pansil, commonly known as Chinese lovage, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to East Asia and features slender, hollow stems with finely cut, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small white to greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots and rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Ligusticum pansil thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments.</p>
