                    <h1>Leiocarpa serpens</h1>
<p>Leiocarpa serpens, commonly known as the serpentine lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, often calcareous soils, particularly in temperate regions. The plant forms a dense, foliose thallus with a pale green to yellowish coloration. Its growth is slow, and it is often found on rocks or soil surfaces.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to colonize harsh environments, making it an important indicator of soil conditions.</p>
