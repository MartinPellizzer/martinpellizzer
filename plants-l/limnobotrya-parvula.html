<p>Limnobotrya parvula, commonly known as the small water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically round or oval in shape, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving waters.</p>
