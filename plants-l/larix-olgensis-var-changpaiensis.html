                    <h1>Larix olgensis var. changpaiensis</h1>
<p>Larix olgensis var. changpaiensis, commonly known as the Changpai larch, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous tree characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that turn a striking golden yellow in autumn. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. It thrives in cold, arid environments with well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and rarity, it is considered a valuable component of the region's biodiversity.</p>
