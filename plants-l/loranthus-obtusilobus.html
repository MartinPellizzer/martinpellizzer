                    <h1>Loranthus obtusilobus</h1>
<p>Loranthus obtusilobus, commonly known as the broad-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of eastern and southeastern Asia. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and its berries are usually red or yellow, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus obtusilobus is often found growing on the branches of angiosperm trees, where it derives some of its nutrients from the host.</p>
