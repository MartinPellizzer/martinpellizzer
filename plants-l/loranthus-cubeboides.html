                    <h1>Loranthus cubeboides</h1>
<p>Loranthus cubeboides, commonly known as the cubeb mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or yellowish and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its spread across forest canopies.</p>
