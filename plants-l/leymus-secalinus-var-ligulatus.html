                    <h1>Leymus secalinus var. ligulatus</h1>
<p>Leymus secalinus var. ligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in disturbed or marginal soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
