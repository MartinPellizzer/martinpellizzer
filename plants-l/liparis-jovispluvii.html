                    <h1>Liparis jovispluvii</h1>
<p>Liparis jovispluvii, commonly known as the celestial orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or violet flowers that resemble celestial bodies, hence its name. The plant has slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery waxy coating. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically growing in rocky crevices or along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis jovispluvii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
