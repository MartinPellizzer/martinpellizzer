<p>Leptalix pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leathery lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety coating of fine hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The thallus is typically dark green to blackish in color, with a leathery texture. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae or cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forest regions.</p>
