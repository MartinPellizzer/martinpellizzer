                    <h1>Lactaria maculata</h1>
<p>Lactaria maculata, commonly known as the spotted milk cap, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white cap with yellowish or reddish spots, which become more pronounced as the mushroom ages. The gill structure is initially white but turns pinkish with age, and the stem is often covered in a sticky, milky substance when broken. It typically grows in coniferous or mixed forests, often associated with decaying wood.</p>
<p>This mushroom is edible when young but can become toxic as it matures, making proper identification crucial for safe consumption.</p>
