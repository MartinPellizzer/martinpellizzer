                    <h1>Loranthus ovatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ovatus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus ovatus is found in various parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, and Australia.</p>
