                    <h1>Lumnitzera edulis</h1>
<p>Lumnitzera edulis, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as mangrove swamps and tidal flats. The plant has pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soil. Its small, white flowers are hermaphroditic, and it produces edible, fleshy fruits that are consumed by various marine and terrestrial animals.</p>
<p>The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting biodiversity.</p>
