                    <h1>Lyonella</h1>
<p>Lyonella, commonly known as the evergreen orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Lyonella species are characterized by their compact, often epiphytic growth habit and their showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The leaves are usually elongated and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and efficient water retention.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, Lyonella plants are cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens for their unique beauty and ecological significance.</p>
