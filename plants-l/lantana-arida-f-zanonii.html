<p>Lantana arida f. zanonii, commonly known as the desert lantana, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. It is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Lantana arida f. zanonii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
