<p>Laguna lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf waterplantain, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater wetlands.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging above the water's surface. Laguna lanceolata thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its presence indicates good water quality and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
