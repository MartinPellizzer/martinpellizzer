                    <h1>Luciola arcuata</h1>
<p>Luciola arcuata, commonly known as the common glowworm, is a species of bioluminescent beetle belonging to the family Lampyridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender body and the presence of luminescent organs on its abdomen that emit a yellow-green light. The larvae, often referred to as "glowworms," are also bioluminescent and are typically found in moist environments such as forests and wetlands. These insects play a role in ecological systems as both predators and prey.</p>
<p>Their light-producing ability is used for attracting mates and, in some cases, for defense mechanisms.</p>
