                    <h1>Loxogramme spatulata</h1>
<p>Loxogramme spatulata, commonly known as the spoonleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive spoon-like base, which gives it its common name. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy substrates, while the fronds float on the water surface.</p>
<p>Loxogramme spatulata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
