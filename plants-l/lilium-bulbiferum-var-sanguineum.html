The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its bulbs are an important part of its structure, storing nutrients for growth and reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
