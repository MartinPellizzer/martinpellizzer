                    <h1>Lythrum tribracteatum var. majus</h1>
<p>Lythrum tribracteatum var. majus, commonly known as purple loosestrife, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy spikes of purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are opposite along the stem and are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to produce thousands of seeds make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
