                    <h1>Leptosiphonium stricklandii</h1>
<p>Leptosiphonium stricklandii, commonly known as the Strickland's leathery fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
