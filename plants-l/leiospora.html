                    <h1>Leiospora</h1>
<p>Leiospora, commonly known as the smooth spore plant, is a genus of fungi that produces smooth, non-ornate spores.</p>
<p>These fungi are typically found in moist, shaded environments, often associated with decaying organic matter. The spores are released in large quantities, aiding in the plant's dispersal. Leiospora species are often used in mycological studies due to their simple structure and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>They play a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
