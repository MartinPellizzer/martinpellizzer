                    <h1>Leucaena × mixtec</h1>
<p>Leucaena × mixtec, commonly known as the hybrid leucaena, is a fast-growing, leguminous shrub or small tree native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are compound and often hairy, and its small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated, flat pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often used for forage, soil improvement, and as a source of nitrogen-fixing biomass.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an important plant in agroforestry systems.</p>
