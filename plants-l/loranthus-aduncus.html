<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as insects and birds. Its berries are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Loranthus aduncus plays a role in ecological interactions, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
