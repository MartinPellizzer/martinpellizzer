                    <h1>Lygodium hastatum</h1>
<p>Lygodium hastatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with aerial roots that allow it to anchor itself to moist surfaces. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Lygodium hastatum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics.</p>
