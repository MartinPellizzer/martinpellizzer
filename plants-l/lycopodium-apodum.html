<p>Lycopodium apodum, commonly known as the naked clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that grow close to the ground and bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems.
