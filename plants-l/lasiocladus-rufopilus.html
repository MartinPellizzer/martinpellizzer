<p>Lasiocladus rufopilus, commonly known as the red-hair lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive orange to reddish thallus, which is covered in a dense layer of small, branched hairs. The lichen forms a crustose growth on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. Its chemical composition includes usnic acid and other secondary metabolites, which contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>This species is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
