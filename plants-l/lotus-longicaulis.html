                    <h1>Lotus longicaulis</h1>
<p>Lotus longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed water lily, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to support its weight on the water's surface.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
