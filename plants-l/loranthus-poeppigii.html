                    <h1>Loranthus poeppigii</h1>
<p>Loranthus poeppigii, commonly known as the Mexican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important food sources for birds and other animals. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds by animals, which then germinate on the bark of suitable host trees.</p>
<p>This species is native to Central and South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
