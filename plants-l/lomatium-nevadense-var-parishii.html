                    <h1>Lomatium nevadense var. parishii</h1>
<p>Lomatium nevadense var. parishii, commonly known as the Sierra lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in subalpine or alpine habitats. Its foliage consists of finely divided, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are small and white or greenish, appear in late spring and are followed by oval, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind.</p>
