<p>Lespedeza violacea, commonly known as violet lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Violet lespedeza is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
