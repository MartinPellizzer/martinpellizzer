                    <h1>Leiocarpa semicalva</h1>
<p>Leiocarpa semicalva, commonly known as the smooth-bark lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, leathery thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark surfaces in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and woodlands. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth, almost waxy texture. It lacks distinct lobes but may have a slightly curled margin.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
