<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Lolium coelorachis is sometimes used in forage production but can also become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
