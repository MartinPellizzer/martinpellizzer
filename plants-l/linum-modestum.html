                    <h1>Linum modestum</h1>
<p>Linum modestum, commonly known as common flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, oval seeds. Linum modestum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields.</p>
<p>It is closely related to the more well-known flax species, Linum usitatissimum, which is cultivated for its fibers and seeds.</p>
