<p>Lycopodium taliense, commonly known as the Taliense clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that enclose the sporangia, which release spores for reproduction. Lycopodium taliense is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
