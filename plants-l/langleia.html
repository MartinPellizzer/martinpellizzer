                    <h1>Langleia</h1>
<p>Langleia, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Langleia species typically have small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in traditional medicine, though they contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
