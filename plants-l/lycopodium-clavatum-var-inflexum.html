                    <h1>Lycopodium clavatum var. inflexum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium clavatum var. inflexum, commonly known as the club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branching stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its sporophyte generation is dominant, with the plant producing both male and female spores on separate structures.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
