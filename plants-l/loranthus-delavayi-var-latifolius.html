                    <h1>Loranthus delavayi var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus delavayi var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a leathery texture, and it is commonly found in mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, while also influencing the growth of its host trees.</p>
