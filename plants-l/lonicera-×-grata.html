<p>Lonicera × grata, commonly known as the everglast honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental purposes. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy appearance, while its berries are red and edible for birds.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive spreading habit.</p>
