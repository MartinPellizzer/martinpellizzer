                    <h1>Libidibia corymbosa</h1>
<p>Libidibia corymbosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, flat seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Libidibia corymbosa is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
