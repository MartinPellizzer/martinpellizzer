<p>Laelia × gigantea, commonly known as the giant laelia, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from its parent species, Laelia and Brassia.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often in shades of white, pink, and red. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid conditions.</p>
<p>Laelia × gigantea is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
