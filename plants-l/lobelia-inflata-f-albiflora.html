<p>Lobelia inflata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Indian tobacco, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has hairy, branched stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>This variant of Lobelia inflata is distinguished by its pale white flowers, contrasting with the more common blue or purple-flowered forms.</p>
