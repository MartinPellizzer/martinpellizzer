                    <h1>Lepanthes monilia</h1>
<p>Lepanthes monilia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees, deriving its nutrients from the air, water, and debris around it. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers with white petals and a distinctive violet or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lepanthes monilia is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
