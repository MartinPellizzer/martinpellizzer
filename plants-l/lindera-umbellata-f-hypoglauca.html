<p>Lindera umbellata f. hypoglauca, commonly known as the pale-leaf sweet pepper tree, is a variant of the sweet pepper tree native to eastern Asia.</p>

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
