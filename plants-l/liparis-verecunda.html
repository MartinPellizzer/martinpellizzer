                    <h1>Liparis verecunda</h1>
<p>Liparis verecunda, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate white or greenish-white flower. The plant lacks a visible stem and grows directly from its rhizome, often in shaded, moist environments. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Liparis verecunda is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
