<p>Leontodon caucasicus var. jailae, commonly known as the Caucasian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by a crown of bracts and a pappus of hairs for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>
