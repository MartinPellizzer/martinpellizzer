                    <h1>Loranthus erectus</h1>
<p>Loranthus erectus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to a variety of host trees, primarily in the tropics and subtropics.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellowish or reddish berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategy make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
