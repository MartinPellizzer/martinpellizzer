                    <h1>Licopolia</h1>
<p>Licopolia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. Licopolia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plants have a rhizomatous growth habit and produce spores in clusters on the underside of their fronds.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
