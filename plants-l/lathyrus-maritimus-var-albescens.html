<p>Lathyrus maritimus var. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered field bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or calcareous soils and is often found in maritime environments.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in coastal ecosystems.</p>
