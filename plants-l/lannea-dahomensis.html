<p>Lannea dahomensis, commonly known as the West African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and long, narrow leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by clustered, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Lannea dahomensis is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
