                    <h1>Leucoxylon</h1>
<p>Leucoxylon, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plants typically have small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of small, white or pink flowers. Leucoxylon species are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, many species are now endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.</p>
