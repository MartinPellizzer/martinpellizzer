                    <h1>Lucuma torta</h1>
<p>Lucuma torta, commonly known as the "tortured lucuma," is a lesser-known member of the *Nucifera* genus, native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its unique, twisted, and often contorted fruit shape, which gives it its common name. The fruit has a thick, fibrous rind that encases a sweet, creamy pulp containing edible seeds. It is typically grown in high-altitude regions with cool, humid climates, requiring well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Despite its unusual appearance, Lucuma torta is valued for its distinct flavor and nutritional content, though it remains relatively obscure compared to other lucuma varieties.</p>
