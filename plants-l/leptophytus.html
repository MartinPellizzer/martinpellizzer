<p>Leptophytus, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and umbel-like inflorescences, which give it a ghostly appearance. The plant is native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Paraguay. Leptophytus species are typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
