                    <h1>Lichtensteinia lacera var. pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Lichtensteinia lacera var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure composed of a cortex, photosynthetic layer, and medulla. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria, which contribute to nitrogen fixation. It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its finely pinnatifid (bifurcated) lobes and a pale to dark green coloration.</p>
