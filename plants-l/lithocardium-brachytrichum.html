                    <h1>Lithocardium brachytrichum</h1>
<p>Lithocardium brachytrichum, commonly known as the short-hair stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems covered in short, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted for storing water and surviving in low-nutrient soils.</p>
<p>Lithocardium brachytrichum is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
