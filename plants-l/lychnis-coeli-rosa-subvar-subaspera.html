<p>Lychnis coeli-rosa subvar. subaspera, commonly known as the rough fireweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental flowers make it a notable wildflower in its native habitats.</p>
