                    <h1>Lasallea</h1>
<p>Lasallea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a thick, spongy tissue. Lasallea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
