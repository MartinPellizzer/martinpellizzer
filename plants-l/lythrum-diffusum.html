                    <h1>Lythrum diffusum</h1>
<p>Lythrum diffusum, commonly known as purple loosestrife, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spike-like clusters of purple flowers that bloom from late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Lythrum diffusum prefers moist soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
