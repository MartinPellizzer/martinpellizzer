                    <h1>Lycopodium polycarpum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium polycarpum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that produces spores rather than seeds. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Lycopodium polycarpum has a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>Its structure reflects adaptations to its ancient lineage, making it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution.</p>
