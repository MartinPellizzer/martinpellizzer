                    <h1>Loranthus pentagonus</h1>
<p>Loranthus pentagonus, commonly known as the five-angled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Asia and is often associated with forest ecosystems.</p>
