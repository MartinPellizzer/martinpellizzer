<p>Leptodactylon californicum subsp.</p>
<p>leptotrichomum, commonly known as the California leathery fern, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, hair-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
