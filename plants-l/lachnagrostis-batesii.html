<p>Lachnagrostis batesii, commonly known as the Bates' wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny grains of pollen. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Lachnagrostis batesii plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native regions.</p>
