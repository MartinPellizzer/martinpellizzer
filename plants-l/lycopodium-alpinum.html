<p>Lycopodium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, high-altitude environments. The plant features tiny, scale-like leaves and produces sporangia that are clustered in cone-like structures called strobila. Lycopodium alpinum is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh environmental conditions makes it an important component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
