                    <h1>Liberatia</h1>
<p>Liberatia, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Liberatia thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
