<p>Lens vulgaris, commonly known as the common vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>
