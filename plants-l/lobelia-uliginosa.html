                    <h1>Lobelia uliginosa</h1>
<p>Lobelia uliginosa, commonly known as swamp lobelia, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and other moist environments, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear whorled clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lobelia uliginosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in sensitive habitats.</p>
