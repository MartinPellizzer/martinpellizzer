                    <h1>Loranthus sechellensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus sechellensis, commonly known as the Seychelles mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees in the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers that attract insects for pollination. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is an important part of the local ecosystem and is protected due to its limited distribution.</p>
