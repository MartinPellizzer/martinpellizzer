                    <h1>Larix × pendula var. repens</h1>
<p>Larix × pendula var. repens, commonly known as the creeping larch, is a hybrid coniferous evergreen shrub that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a natural cross between Larix decidua (European larch) and Larix gmelinii (Siberian larch), resulting in a plant with distinctive, cascading foliage. The leaves are needle-like, bright green, and often hang in long, drooping clusters, giving the plant its ornamental appeal. It produces small, cone-like structures that mature into woody cones, typical of the Larix genus.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its compact growth habit and cold hardiness.</p>
