<p>Lycopersicon bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the wild tomato, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy stems. The leaves are deeply lobed, with a bipinnatifid structure, giving them a finely divided appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals, and it produces small, green fruits that turn red when mature.</p>
