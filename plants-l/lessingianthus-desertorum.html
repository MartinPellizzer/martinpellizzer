<p>Lessingianthus desertorum, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry, hot environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
