                    <h1>Leptorkis bicornis</h1>
<p>Leptorkis bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, small, and intricately shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive bifurcated lip that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Leptorkis bicornis is considered endangered and is protected in many countries.</p>
