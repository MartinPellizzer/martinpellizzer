<p>Lindsaea concinna, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of many bromeliads. Lindsaea concinna is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on tropical plant morphology and ecology.</p>
