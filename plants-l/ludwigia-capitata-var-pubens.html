<p>Ludwigia capitata var. pubens, commonly known as the velvetleaf water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact inflorescences, typically emerging above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions make it a common species in both natural and artificial aquatic habitats.</p>
