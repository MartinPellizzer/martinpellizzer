                    <h1>Lactuca scariola var. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Lactuca scariola var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lettuce, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of dark green, broad, and toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, green flowers in a cluster at the end of each stem, which are followed by small, spiky seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other lettuce species and is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
