<p>Lintersemina, commonly known as the golden seed plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. The plant has a short growing season and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hair.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lintersemina is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
