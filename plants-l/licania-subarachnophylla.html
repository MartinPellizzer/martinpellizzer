                    <h1>Licania subarachnophylla</h1>
<p>Licania subarachnophylla, commonly known as the spider-scale tree, is a flowering plant species native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, scale-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its bark is often covered in a fibrous, woody texture. Licania subarachnophylla is adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of the understory in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
