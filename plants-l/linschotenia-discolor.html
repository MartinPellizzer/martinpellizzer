                    <h1>Linschotenia discolor</h1>
<p>Linschotenia discolor, commonly known as the spotted lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct, irregularly shaped thallus with a pale green to yellowish upper surface and a darker, often reddish lower surface. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead forming a symbiotic association between algae and fungi. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its unique coloration and growth patterns make it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
