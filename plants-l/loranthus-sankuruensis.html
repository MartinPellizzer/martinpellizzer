                    <h1>Loranthus sankuruensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus sankuruensis, commonly known as the Sankuru mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the Euphorbiaceae family, and derives its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains sticky seeds. Loranthus sankuruensis is native to central Africa, particularly in regions like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant-host interactions and ecological relationships.</p>
