                    <h1>Loranthus homoplasticus</h1>
<p>Loranthus homoplasticus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological balance by providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
