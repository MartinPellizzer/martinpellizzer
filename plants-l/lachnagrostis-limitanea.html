                    <h1>Lachnagrostis limitanea</h1>
<p>Lachnagrostis limitanea, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, making it an important component of dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes helps prevent erosion and supports biodiversity in coastal habitats.</p>
