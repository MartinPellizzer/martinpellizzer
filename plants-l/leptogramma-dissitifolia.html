<p>Leptogramma dissitifolia, commonly known as the scattered-leaved fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with small, scattered hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, bright green leaves.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation.</p>
