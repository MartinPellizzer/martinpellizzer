<p>Lachnaea globulifera subsp.</p>
<p>globulifera, commonly known as the globular lichen, is a member of the Lichens family, characterized by its unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has leaf-like lobes that are flat and broad, often with a distinct upper and lower surface.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it can absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its structure is composed of a fungal matrix that encases the algal cells, providing protection and support.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called soredia, are often found on the upper surface, enabling asexual propagation through fragmentation.</p>
