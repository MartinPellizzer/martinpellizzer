                    <h1>Lachnopylis glomerulata</h1>
<p>Lachnopylis glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered lichen grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it blend into its natural habitat.</p>
<p>L. glomerulata is often found in moist, sandy soils in open woodlands and is adapted to thrive in partial shade.</p>
