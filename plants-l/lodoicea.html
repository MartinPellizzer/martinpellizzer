                    <h1>Lodoicea</h1>
<p>Lodoicea, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique plant native to the Socotra Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped canopy and thick, leathery leaves. The tree produces a red, resinous sap that has been historically used for medicinal and artistic purposes. Its slow growth and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to the harsh, arid environment of its native habitat.</p>
