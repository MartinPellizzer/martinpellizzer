                    <h1>Lannea asymmetrica</h1>
<p>Lannea asymmetrica, commonly known as the African velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Lannea asymmetrica plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
