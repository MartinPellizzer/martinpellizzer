                    <h1>Lycoseris squarrosa</h1>
<p>Lycoseris squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy lycoperd, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Lycoperdaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing structure known as a volva, which is often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas, such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is commonly found in temperate regions. It plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter and contributes to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological function, it is of interest to mycologists and ecological researchers.</p>
