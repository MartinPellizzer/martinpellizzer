                            <h1>Leucanthemum Gaetulum</h1>
<p>Leucanthemum gaetulum is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is known for its small, white flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes. Its beauty and rarity make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
