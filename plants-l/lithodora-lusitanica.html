<p>Lithodora lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats such as limestone slopes and woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to spread easily.</p>
