<p>Lamanonia ulei, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a complex root system, including pneumatophores, which allow it to breathe in waterlogged soil. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Lamanonia ulei is also known for its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding.</p>
