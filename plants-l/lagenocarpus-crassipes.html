<p>Lagenocarpus crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across water surfaces. Its fronds are usually divided into segments, and it produces spores rather than seeds for reproduction.</p>
<p>Lagenocarpus crassipes plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
