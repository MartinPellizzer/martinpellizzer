                    <h1>Loranthus triplinervius</h1>
<p>Loranthus triplinervius, commonly known as the three-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
