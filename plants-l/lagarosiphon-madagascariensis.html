<p>Lagarosiphon madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar water plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender stems that float on the water surface, with small, narrow leaves arranged spirally. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by small, elliptical fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in non-native regions.</p>
