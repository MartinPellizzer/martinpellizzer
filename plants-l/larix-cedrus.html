                    <h1>Larix cedrus</h1>
<p>Larix cedrus, commonly known as the cedar larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a conical shape, with needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before falling off. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and reddish-brown, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Larix cedrus is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions where it forms dense forests.</p>
