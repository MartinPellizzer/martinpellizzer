                    <h1>Lithocarpus pseudoxizangensis</h1>
<p>Lithocarpus pseudoxizangensis, commonly known as the Xizang stone栎, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its evergreen foliage and hard, woody structure.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. The plant produces small, persistent nuts enclosed in a thick, leathery cupule, a feature typical of the genus Lithocarpus. Its leaves are usually革质 (leathery), with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
