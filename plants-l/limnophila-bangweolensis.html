<p>Limnophila bangweolensis, commonly known as the Bangweol water plant, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Bangweol Lake region in Botswana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring shallow, nutrient-rich waters. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
