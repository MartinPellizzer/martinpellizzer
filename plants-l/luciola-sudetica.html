<p>Luciola sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic firefly, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Lampyridae.</p>
<p>It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, particularly found in regions such as the Sudetes mountain range. The plant aspect of this species refers to its bioluminescent larvae, which emit a characteristic greenish light. The larvae are often found in moist habitats like meadows and forests, where they feed on snails and slugs.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat through its predatory behavior and bioluminescence.</p>
