<p>Limnogenneton abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to anchor in the muddy lake bottoms, while its stems are flexible to withstand water currents.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
