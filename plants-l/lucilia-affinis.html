                    <h1>Lucilia affinis</h1>
<p>Lucilia affinis, commonly known as the green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive appearance, often mistaken for other fly species. The plant aspect of Lucilia affinis refers to its role as a saprophagous organism, feeding on decaying organic matter rather than photosynthesizing. It plays a significant role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its association with carrion, it is often used in forensic entomology to estimate the time of death in criminal investigations.</p>
