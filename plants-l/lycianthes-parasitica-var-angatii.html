<p>Lycianthes parasitica var. angatii, commonly known as the Angatii morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing on its own. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic behavior and ornamental flowers make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
