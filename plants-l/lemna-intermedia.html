                    <h1>Lemna intermedia</h1>
<p>Lemna intermedia, commonly known as the floating heart, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, broad leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants developing from the nodes along the stolons. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
