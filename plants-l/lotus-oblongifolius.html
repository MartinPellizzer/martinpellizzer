                    <h1>Lotus oblongifolius</h1>
<p>Lotus oblongifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf water-lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Lotus oblongifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
