<p>Linaria pedunculata var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow toadflax, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers resembling those of snapdragons. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential in some regions, it is often cultivated with caution.</p>
