                    <h1>Limnochloa fistulosa</h1>
<p>Limnochloa fistulosa, commonly known as the water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes spread along the bottom of the water body, helping to stabilize the substrate.</p>
<p>Limnochloa fistulosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients.</p>
