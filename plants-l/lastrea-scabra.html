                    <h1>Lastrea scabra</h1>
<p>Lastrea scabra, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to store water in its leaves, it is well adapted to arid environments.</p>
