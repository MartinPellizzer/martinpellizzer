                    <h1>Loranthus tetragonus</h1>
<p>Loranthus tetragonus, commonly known as the four-cornered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own food through photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant has a distinctive four-angled stem and small, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on a variety of host trees.</p>
