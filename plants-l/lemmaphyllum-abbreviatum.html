                    <h1>Lemmaphyllum abbreviatum</h1>
<p>Lemmaphyllum abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf lemmaphyllum, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
