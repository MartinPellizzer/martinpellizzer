                    <h1>Lactuca dumicola</h1>
<p>Lactuca dumicola, commonly known as the sand lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional cuisines, though they are generally less palatable than those of other lettuce species.</p>
<p>Lactuca dumicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
