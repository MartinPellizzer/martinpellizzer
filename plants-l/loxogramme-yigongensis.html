                    <h1>Loxogramme yigongensis</h1>
<p>Loxogramme yigongensis, commonly known as the Yigong water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in diameter. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor in shallow water and absorb nutrients. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Loxogramme yigongensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
