                    <h1>Lobaria rivularis</h1>
<p>Lobaria rivularis, commonly known as the river lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct lobes and a granular texture. The lichen contains a unique combination of photobionts, primarily green algae, and a fungal component from the genus Lobaria. It is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, it is considered an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
