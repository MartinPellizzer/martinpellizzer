                    <h1>Leptactina heinsioides</h1>
<p>Leptactina heinsioides, commonly known as the Heinsii fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green and covered in a thin layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
