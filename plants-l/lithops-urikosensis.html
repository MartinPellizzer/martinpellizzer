<p>Lithops urikosensis, commonly known as the "living stone," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and they often have a subtle pattern resembling rock formations.</p>
<p>Lithops urikosensis is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and requires minimal care when grown in a suitable environment.</p>
