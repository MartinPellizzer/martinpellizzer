<p>Lappa bardana subsp.</p>
<p>macrospermum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, and its showy, umbrella-shaped inflorescence with small white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces a milky sap containing phototoxic compounds, which can cause severe skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
