                    <h1>Lotus angustissimus var. brachycarpus</h1>
<p>Lotus angustissimus var. brachycarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, narrow leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom above the water, often in late summer. Its roots are adapted for aquatic environments, anchoring it in muddy substrates.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in water gardens.</p>
