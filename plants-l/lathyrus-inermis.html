                    <h1>Lathyrus inermis</h1>
<p>Lathyrus inermis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
