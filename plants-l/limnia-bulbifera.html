                    <h1>Limnia bulbifera</h1>
<p>Limnia bulbifera, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a rosette-shaped structure with broad, waxy leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces bulb-like structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, and it often forms dense mats on the surface.</p>
<p>Limnia bulbifera is commonly found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats.</p>
