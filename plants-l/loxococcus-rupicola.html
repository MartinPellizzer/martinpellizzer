                    <h1>Loxococcus rupicola</h1>
<p>Loxococcus rupicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It is typically found growing on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it can withstand harsh conditions such as high sunlight and low moisture. The plant's structure consists of a dense, crust-like growth that adheres tightly to the substrate, allowing it to efficiently absorb nutrients and water from the environment. Loxococcus rupicola plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in extreme conditions makes it an indicator species for rocky, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
