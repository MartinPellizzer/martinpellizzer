                    <h1>Lythrum salicaria subvar. gracilius</h1>
<p>Lythrum salicaria subvar. gracilius, commonly known as narrow-leaved common loosestrife, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, including marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife.</p>
