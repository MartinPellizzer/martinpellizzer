                    <h1>Lupinus fischerianus</h1>
<p>Lupinus fischerianus, commonly known as Fischer's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Lupinus fischerianus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
