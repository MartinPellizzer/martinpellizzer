<p>Leptopteris fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental ponds and water gardens. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctively shaped apex that aids in water movement.</p>
<p>Leptopteris fraseri plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
