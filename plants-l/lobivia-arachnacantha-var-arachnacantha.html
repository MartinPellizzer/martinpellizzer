<p>Lobivia arachnacantha var. arachnacantha, commonly known as the spider-tailed cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch into spiny, segmented clusters, giving it a distinctive, spiky appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ability to form dense stands, which can provide habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
