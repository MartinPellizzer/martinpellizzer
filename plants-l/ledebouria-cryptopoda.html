<p>Ledebouria cryptopoda, commonly known as the Cape goldcup, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Ledebouria cryptopoda is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
