                    <h1>Litobrochia cumingiana</h1>
<p>Litobrochia cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's rock-moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort found in specific alpine and arctic environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant thrives in moist, rocky substrates and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its morphology includes small, elongated leaves with a distinct midrib, and it reproduces via spores released from leaf-like structures called gametophores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change.</p>
