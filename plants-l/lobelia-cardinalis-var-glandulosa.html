                    <h1>Lobelia cardinalis var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Lobelia cardinalis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the showy cardinalflower, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats, preferring partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with small, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive texture.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the common cardinalflower but is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and habitat preferences.</p>
