                    <h1>Lecanorchis kiusiana f. lutea</h1>
<p>Lecanorchis kiusiana f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow-flowered twayblade, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
