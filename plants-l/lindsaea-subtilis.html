<p>Lindsaea subtilis, commonly known as the delicate lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of minute, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Lindsaea subtilis is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it is often found on tree trunks or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
