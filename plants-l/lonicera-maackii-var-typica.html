                    <h1>Lonicera maackii var. typica</h1>
<p>Lonicera maackii var. typica, commonly known as Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers that turn orange-red as they mature. It is often found in moist, woodland areas and can spread aggressively through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats.</p>
