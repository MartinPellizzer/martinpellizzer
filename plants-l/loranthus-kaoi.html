<p>Loranthus kaoi, commonly known as the Kaoi mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds in return. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are typically visited by insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
