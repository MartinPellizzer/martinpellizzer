                    <h1>Loranthus viscoides</h1>
<p>Loranthus viscoides, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in holiday decorations. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is known for its symbiotic relationship with its host.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time if not managed.</p>
