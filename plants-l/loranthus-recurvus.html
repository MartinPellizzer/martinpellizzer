                    <h1>Loranthus recurvus</h1>
<p>Loranthus recurvus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to bird feathers for dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by supporting various bird and insect species.</p>
