                    <h1>Linagrostis vulgaris</h1>
<p>Linagrostis vulgaris, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Linagrostis vulgaris is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates.</p>
