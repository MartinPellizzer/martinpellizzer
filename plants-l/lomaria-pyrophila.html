                    <h1>Lomaria pyrophila</h1>
<p>Lomaria pyrophila, commonly known as the fire-loving lichen, is a unique species that thrives in environments with frequent wildfires.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic lichen composed of a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, high-heat conditions. The plant's ability to withstand fire is due to its dense, moisture-retaining structure that protects its symbiotic components. It often colonizes burned areas quickly, playing a vital role in ecological succession.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of fire-prone ecosystems and contributes to soil stabilization in post-fire landscapes.</p>
