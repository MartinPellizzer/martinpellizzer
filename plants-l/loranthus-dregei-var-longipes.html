                    <h1>Loranthus dregei var. longipes</h1>
<p>Loranthus dregei var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through haustoria, drawing water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions like South Africa and Namibia, where it thrives on various host species such as acacia and eucalyptus. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitats.</p>
