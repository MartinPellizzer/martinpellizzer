                    <h1>Lucuma rivicoa var. glaucophylla</h1>
<p>Lucuma rivicoa var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the white-fleshed lucuma, is a lesser-known variant of the lucuma species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white pulp, which is distinct from the more commonly cultivated orange-fleshed varieties. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when fully matured. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in high-altitude, temperate climates.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique flavor and nutritional content, though it remains relatively rare in commercial cultivation.</p>
