<p>Liparis volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils found in areas with recent volcanic activity. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
