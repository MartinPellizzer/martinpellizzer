                    <h1>Loranthus barthei</h1>
<p>Loranthus barthei, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Loranthus barthei is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it plays a role in ecological interactions and may have traditional medicinal uses.</p>
