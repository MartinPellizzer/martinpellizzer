<p>Lachnorhiza piloselloides subsp.</p>
<p>piloselloides, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a pale green to yellowish thallus with a leathery texture and is often found on bark, stones, or soil.</p>
<p>The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its thallus for nutrient uptake and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its delicate, sprawling growth form and is typically found in temperate regions.</p>
