<p>Lycopodioides xiphophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique morphology with a prostrate or erect growth habit, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces microspores and megaspores in specialized structures called strobili, which are typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures and leaf morphology are key features that distinguish it from other clubmoss species.</p>
