                    <h1>Leighia microphylla</h1>
<p>Leighia microphylla, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
