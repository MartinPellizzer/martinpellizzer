                    <h1>Lathraea clandestina var. pallidiflora</h1>
<p>Lathraea clandestina var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections with host plants. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to southern Europe and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its unique parasitic nature and subtle appearance, it is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
