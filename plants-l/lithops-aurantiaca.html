                    <h1>Lithops aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Lithops aurantiaca, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rocky appearance. Its leaves are covered in a powdery coating that reduces water loss and protects against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Lithops aurantiica is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
