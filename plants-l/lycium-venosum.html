                    <h1>Lycium venosum</h1>
<p>Lycium venosum, commonly known as the red berry lycium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, small alternate leaves, and clusters of bright red berries that are edible. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its berries are rich in antioxidants and are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Lycium venosum plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and small mammals.</p>
