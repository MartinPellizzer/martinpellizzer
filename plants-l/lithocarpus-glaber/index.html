                            <h1>Lithocarpus Glaber</h1>
<p>Smoothleaf ironwood, scientifically known as Lithocarpus glaber, is a remarkable evergreen tree native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. This species is notable for its hard, dense wood that has historically been used by indigenous communities for tools and construction. Its leaves are smooth and leathery, giving it a unique appearance that helps it thrive in shady, humid environments. The tree also produces edible nuts, which play an important role in local ecosystems and traditional diets. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Smoothleaf ironwood is now considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
