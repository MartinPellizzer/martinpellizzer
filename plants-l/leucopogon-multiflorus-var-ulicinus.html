                    <h1>Leucopogon multiflorus var. ulicinus</h1>
<p>Leucopogon multiflorus var. ulicinus, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
