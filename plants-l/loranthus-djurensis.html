                    <h1>Loranthus djurensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus djurensis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the African savanna.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are consumed by various birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature can weaken the host tree over time, making it an important ecological factor in its habitat.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic lifestyle, Loranthus djurensis plays a role in supporting local wildlife through its fruit.</p>
