<p>Laxanon, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Laxanon thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in many areas.</p>
