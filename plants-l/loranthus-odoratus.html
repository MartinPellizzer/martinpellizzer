                    <h1>Loranthus odoratus</h1>
<p>Loranthus odoratus, commonly known as the sweet-scented mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emit a fragrant aroma, attracting insects for pollination. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus odoratus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with various tree species.</p>
