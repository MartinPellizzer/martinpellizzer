<p>Larix amurensis, commonly known as the Amur larch, is a coniferous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden yellow in the fall before shedding, a unique feature among conifers. The tree produces cone-like structures called cones, which contain the seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas of Russia, China, and Korea.</p>
<p>Larix amurensis is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
