<p>Lagenophora barkeri, commonly known as the Barker's lagenophora, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range.</p>
