                    <h1>Loranthus panganensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus panganensis, commonly known as the Philippine mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Loranthus panganensis is considered vulnerable and is of interest in conservation studies.</p>
