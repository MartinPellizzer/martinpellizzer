<p>Lophotaenia, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers and are typically found in high-altitude regions. Lophotaenia species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, often in humid, shaded environments. They have specialized roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from their surroundings.</p>
<p>The genus is relatively small, with only a few recognized species, and is primarily distributed in the temperate and subtropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
