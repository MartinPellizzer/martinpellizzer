<p>Ladanium cyprium, commonly known as the golden sunflower, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features large, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has a robust, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The botanical name reflects its association with copper-rich soils, where it often grows in mineral-rich environments.</p>
