<p>Leymus crassiusculus, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Velvet fescue is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its rhizomatous root system.</p>
