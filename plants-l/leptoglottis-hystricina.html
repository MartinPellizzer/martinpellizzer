<p>Leptoglottis hystricina, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens.</p>
