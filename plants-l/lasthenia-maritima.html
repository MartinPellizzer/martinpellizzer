                    <h1>Lasthenia maritima</h1>
<p>Lasthenia maritima, commonly known as the seaside dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along beaches and dunes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
