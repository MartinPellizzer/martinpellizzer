                    <h1>Loranthus radicans</h1>
<p>Loranthus radicans, commonly known as the mistletoe vine, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, green leaves and white or pink flowers, often blooming in the spring. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus radicans is found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it forms a unique ecological relationship with its host plants.</p>
