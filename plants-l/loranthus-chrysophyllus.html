<p>Loranthus chrysophyllus, commonly known as the golden-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and have a distinctive golden or yellowish hue, which contributes to its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or greenish in color.</p>
<p>It plays an ecological role in supporting certain bird species that feed on its berries.</p>
