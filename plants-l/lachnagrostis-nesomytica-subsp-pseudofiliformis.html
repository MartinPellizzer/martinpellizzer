<p>Lachnagrostis nesomytica subsp.</p>
<p>pseudofiliformis, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Its subspecies status highlights subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and growth habits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
