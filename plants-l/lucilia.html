                    <h1>Lucilia</h1>
<p>Lucilia, commonly known as the green bottle fly, is a genus of flies belonging to the family Calliphoridae.</p>
<p>These insects are characterized by their metallic green or blue coloration and are often found near decaying organic matter. Lucilia species play a role in ecological decomposition by breaking down dead animal tissue. They are also used in forensic science to estimate the time of death in criminal investigations.</p>
<p>The larvae, or maggots, are important in natural recycling processes within ecosystems.</p>
