                            <h1>Lagotis Minor</h1>
<p>Lesser bluebell, scientifically known as Lagotis minor, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. This rare and often overlooked species thrives in rocky and woodland habitats, where it forms dense carpets of color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Lesser bluebell is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
