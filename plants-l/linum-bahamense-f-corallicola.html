<p>Linum bahamense f. corallicola, commonly known as the Bahamian flax, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
