                    <h1>Lanium avicula var. subteretifolia</h1>
<p>Lanium avicula var. subteretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, subteretifoliate leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
