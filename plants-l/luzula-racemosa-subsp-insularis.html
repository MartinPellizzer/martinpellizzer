<p>Luzula racemosa subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the island tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain island regions of the Pacific. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth form and specific habitat preferences compared to other Luzula species.</p>
