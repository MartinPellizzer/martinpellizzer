                    <h1>Loranthus tahitensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to the islands of French Polynesia and is an important part of the local ecosystem.</p>
