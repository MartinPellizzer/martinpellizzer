                    <h1>Loranthus forstenii</h1>
<p>Loranthus forstenii, commonly known as the Forsten's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, typically the acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, leathery leaves and white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus forstenii is found in arid regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
