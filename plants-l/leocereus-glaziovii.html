                    <h1>Leocereus glaziovii</h1>
<p>Leocereus glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziovâ€™s night bloomer, is a cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white spines. The plant produces striking, large, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
