<p>Lachemilla nivalis, commonly known as the alpine moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery or grayish coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Lachemilla nivalis is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes.</p>
