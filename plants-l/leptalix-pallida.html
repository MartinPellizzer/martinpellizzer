                    <h1>Leptalix pallida</h1>
<p>Leptalix pallida, commonly known as the pale leathery lichen, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits a distinct botanical structure.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, pale-colored thallus, which is typically crust-like in appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which is essential for its survival. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and specialized habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
