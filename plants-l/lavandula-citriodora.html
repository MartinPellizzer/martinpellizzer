<p>Lavandula citriodora, commonly known as lemon lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fragrant, narrow leaves that emit a citrus-like aroma. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to lavender flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its essential oil, rich in citral, is widely used in aromatherapy and perfumery.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
