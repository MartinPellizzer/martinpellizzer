<p>Lotodes californicum, commonly known as the California water shield, is a aquatic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers appear in late spring and early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>The roots of Lotodes californicum help stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering out impurities.</p>
