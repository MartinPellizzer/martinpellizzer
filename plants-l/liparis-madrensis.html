                    <h1>Liparis madrensis</h1>
<p>Liparis madrensis, commonly known as the Madrean lip orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Madrean region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and its unique, spurred orchid flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in forested or scrubland habitats. It produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis madrensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
