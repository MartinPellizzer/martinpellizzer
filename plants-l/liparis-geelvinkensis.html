<p>Liparis geelvinkensis, commonly known as the Geelvink's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Indonesian island of Flores.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct exposure. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
