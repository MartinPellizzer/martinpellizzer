<p>Cape gold, scientifically known as Leucadendron grandiflorum, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is celebrated for its vibrant, golden-orange flowers that bloom in late winter and early spring, adding a splash of color to gardens and natural landscapes. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its unique foliage, featuring narrow, needle-like leaves, complements its showy blooms and adds visual interest throughout the year. Cape gold is not only a decorative plant but also an important component of local ecosystems, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
