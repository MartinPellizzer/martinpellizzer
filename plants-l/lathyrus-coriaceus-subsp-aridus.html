<p>Lathyrus coriaceus subsp.</p>
<p>aridus, commonly known as the desert vetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to violet.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
