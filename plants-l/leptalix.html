                    <h1>Leptalix</h1>
<p>Leptalix, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, crust-like growth form, which adheres tightly to substrates such as bark, stone, or soil. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Leptalix is often found in temperate and boreal regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an important indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
