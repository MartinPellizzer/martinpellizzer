                    <h1>Lupulus lupuloides var. domingensis</h1>
<p>Lupulus lupuloides var. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican hops, is a lesser-known variety of hops native to the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique aroma profile, which includes notes of citrus, tropical fruit, and a subtle herbal undertone. The plant produces cone-shaped flowers, known as hop cones, which are rich in essential oils and bitter compounds. These cones are typically harvested when they reach full maturity, ensuring optimal flavor and aroma.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a rare and specialized ingredient in craft brewing.</p>
