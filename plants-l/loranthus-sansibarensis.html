                    <h1>Loranthus sansibarensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus sansibarensis, commonly known as the East African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species is native to the tropical regions of East Africa and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest ecosystems.</p>
