                    <h1>Lastrea pentagona</h1>
<p>Lastrea pentagona, commonly known as the five-angled ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
