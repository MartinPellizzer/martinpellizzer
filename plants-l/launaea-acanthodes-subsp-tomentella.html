<p>Launaea acanthodes subsp.</p>
<p>tomentella, commonly known as the woolly prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and spiny stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
