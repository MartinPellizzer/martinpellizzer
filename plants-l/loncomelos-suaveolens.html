                    <h1>Loncomelos suaveolens</h1>
<p>Loncomelos suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, ovate leaves that are typically evergreen and emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Loncomelos suaveolens is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
