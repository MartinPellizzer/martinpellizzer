                    <h1>Loranthus bussei</h1>
<p>Loranthus bussei, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the African region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its berries are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds to new host trees, facilitating the plant's propagation.</p>
