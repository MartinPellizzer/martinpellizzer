                    <h1>Lycopodium digitatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium digitatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that typically grows in dense, low mats. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are called strobila, which are cone-like formations. Lycopodium digitatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage provides insights into the early evolution of land plants.</p>
