                    <h1>Lepidogrammitis diversa</h1>
<p>Lepidogrammitis diversa, commonly known as the variable fern, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Lepidogrammitis diversa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
