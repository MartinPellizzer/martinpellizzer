<p>Leontonyx stramineus, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Leontonyx stramineus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
