                    <h1>Liabum lanatum</h1>
<p>Liabum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant is known for its ability to produce tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are used for nutrient absorption, allowing the plant to thrive in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
<p>Liabum lanatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality.</p>
