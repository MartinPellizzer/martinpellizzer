                    <h1>Leontodon palustris var. obliquus</h1>
<p>Leontodon palustris var. obliquus, commonly known as the bent-leaved bog grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that curve downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the dandelion family, Asteraceae, and is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local insect populations.</p>
