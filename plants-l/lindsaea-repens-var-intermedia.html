<p>Lindsaea repens var. intermedia, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its lanceolate, glossy green leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth pattern.</p>
