                    <h1>Lycotis</h1>
<p>Lycotis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers and lack of visible leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant is typically found in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and bogs, where it thrives on the roots of trees. Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
<p>Lycotis is a fascinating example of adaptive evolution in tropical flora.</p>
