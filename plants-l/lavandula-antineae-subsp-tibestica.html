<p>Lavandula antineae subsp.</p>
<p>tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti lavender, is a subspecies native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 centimeters.</p>

<p>This resilient plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal uses.</p>
