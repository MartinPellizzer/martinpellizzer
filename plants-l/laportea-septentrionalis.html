                    <h1>Laportea septentrionalis</h1>
<p>Laportea septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern ironweed, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of small, purple to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Laportea septentrionalis is often found in prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
