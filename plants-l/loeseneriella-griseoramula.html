<p>Loeseneriella griseoramula, commonly known as the gray ramular lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale gray to olive-green thallus, which is typically covered with a fine, powdery layer of granules. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, specifically Trebouxia species, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to air pollution and serves as an indicator of environmental health.</p>
