<p>It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its leaves are small, smooth, and often waxy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Its berries, which are usually red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
