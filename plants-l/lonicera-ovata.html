<p>Lonicera ovata, commonly known as the redbank honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the spring. Its berries are red and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed by humans as those of other honeysuckle species.</p>
<p>Lonicera ovata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
