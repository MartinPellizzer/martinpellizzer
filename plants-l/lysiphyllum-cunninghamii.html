<p>Lysiphyllum cunninghamii, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>Lysiphyllum cunninghamii is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
