                    <h1>Lepidaploa orbicularis</h1>
<p>Lepidaploa orbicularis, commonly known as the globular lichen, is a unique species characterized by its rounded, disc-like thallus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is typically found growing on tree bark in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a leathery texture with a pale to dark green coloration, often with a distinct central umbilicus. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic relationship with algae for nutrition.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator species for forest health and biodiversity.</p>
