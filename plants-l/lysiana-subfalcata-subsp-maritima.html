<p>Lysiana subfalcata subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as the coastal lichen, is a specialized plant adapted to maritime environments. It thrives in salt-laden air and sandy soils, often found along coastal cliffs and dunes.</p>
<p>This subspecies exhibits a unique morphology with a flattened, crust-like thallus that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its reproductive structures are typically embedded within the thallus, making them less conspicuous.</p>
<p>The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems by preventing soil erosion.</p>
