<p>Lupinus pratensis, commonly known as the meadow lupine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Lupinus pratensis is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
