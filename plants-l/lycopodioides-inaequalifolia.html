                    <h1>Lycopodioides inaequalifolia</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides inaequalifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia responsible for releasing spores. Lycopodioides inaequalifolia typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple, primitive morphology reflects its ancient lineage within the vascular plant group.</p>
