                    <h1>Libanothamnus × gritaensis</h1>
<p>Libanothamnus × gritaensis, commonly known as the hybrid desert shrub, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Libanothamnus scabridus* and *Libanothamnus fremontii*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody growth habit and small, glandular leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is typically found in rocky soils and dry slopes across the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
