<p>Lilium krameri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a species of flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows from a bulb and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots that allow it to access underground water sources. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Lilium krameri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and minimal water.</p>
