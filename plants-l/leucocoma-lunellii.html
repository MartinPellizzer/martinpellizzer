<p>Leucocoma lunellii, commonly known as the moonlight lichen, is a rare and unique species of lichen that thrives in cool, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white or cream-colored thallus, which gives it its distinctive appearance. This lichen is typically found on the bark of trees or on rocky surfaces in forested areas. Its growth is slow, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
