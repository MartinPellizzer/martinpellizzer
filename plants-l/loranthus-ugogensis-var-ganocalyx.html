                    <h1>Loranthus ugogensis var. ganocalyx</h1>
<p>Loranthus ugogensis var. ganocalyx, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to regions of Africa and is often found in dry, savanna-like environments.</p>
