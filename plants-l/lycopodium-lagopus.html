                    <h1>Lycopodium lagopus</h1>
<p>Lycopodium lagopus, commonly known as the ground pine, is a species of clubmoss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Lycopodium lagopus is often found in rocky or forested areas, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
