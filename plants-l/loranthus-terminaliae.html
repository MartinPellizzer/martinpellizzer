                    <h1>Loranthus terminaliae</h1>
<p>Loranthus terminaliae, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in short inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating propagation.</p>
<p>Loranthus terminaliae is found in various regions of Africa and is known for its ecological role in supporting bird species that feed on its berries.</p>
