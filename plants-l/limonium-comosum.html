<p>Limonium comosum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that resemble combs, giving it its species name "comosum.". It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Limonium comosum blooms in summer, adding vibrant color to coastal gardens and natural habitats.</p>
