                    <h1>Lophophora lutea</h1>
<p>Lophophora lutea, commonly known as the yellow peyote, is a small cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Lophophora lutea contains the psychoactive compound mescaline, which has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for spiritual and medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
