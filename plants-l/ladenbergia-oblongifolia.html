                    <h1>Ladenbergia oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Ladenbergia oblongifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for carpentry and furniture-making.</p>
