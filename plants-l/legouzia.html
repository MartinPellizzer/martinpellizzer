<p>Legouzia, commonly known as the "false larkspur," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically herbaceous, with hairy stems and showy, often blue or purple flowers. They are native to regions in southern Europe and western Asia, where they thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Legouzia species are characterized by their narrow, lance-shaped leaves and are often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they can be toxic if ingested.</p>
