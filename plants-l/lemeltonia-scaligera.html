                    <h1>Lemeltonia scaligera</h1>
<p>Lemeltonia scaligera, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
