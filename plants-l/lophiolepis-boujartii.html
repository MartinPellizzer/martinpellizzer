<p>Lophiolepis boujartii, commonly known as the Boujart's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to the substrate, typically found on bark or stone in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a finely granular surface texture. It lacks distinct lobes but may have a low, irregularly bordered margin.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in regions with moderate to high humidity and is used as an indicator of environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
