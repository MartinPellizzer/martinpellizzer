<p>Lagarosiphon nyassae, commonly known as the water plantain, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the aquatic environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the summer months. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
