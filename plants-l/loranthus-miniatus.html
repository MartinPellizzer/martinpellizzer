                    <h1>Loranthus miniatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus miniatus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as oaks and pines, and derives its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous and lack showy petals. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus miniatus plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
