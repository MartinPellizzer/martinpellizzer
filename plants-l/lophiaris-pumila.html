<p>Lophiaris pumila, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Lophiaris pumila is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water.</p>
