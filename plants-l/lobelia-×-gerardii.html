                    <h1>Lobelia × gerardii</h1>
<p>Lobelia × gerardii, commonly known as the hybrid cardinal flower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a cross between *Lobelia siphilitica* and *Lobelia cardinalis*, resulting in a plant with striking red-orange tubular flowers. The species exhibits a range of morphological variation, including differences in flower color and leaf shape. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pollinator attractant and its use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
