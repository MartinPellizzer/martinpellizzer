<p>Lastreopsis recedens, commonly known as the creeping lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, layered structure with a dark, leathery upper surface and a lighter, spongy lower layer. The plant is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
