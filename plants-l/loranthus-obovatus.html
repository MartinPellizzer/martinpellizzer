                    <h1>Loranthus obovatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-ovate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are adapted for bird dispersal. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important part of the ecosystem, supporting various wildlife species.</p>
