                    <h1>Lampranthus persistens</h1>
<p>Lampranthus persistens, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, torch-like inflorescences. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lampranthus persistens is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
