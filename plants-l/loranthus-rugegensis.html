                    <h1>Loranthus rugegensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus rugegensis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily from the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. It is native to southern Africa and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
