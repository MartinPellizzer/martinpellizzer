                    <h1>Loranthus galpinii</h1>
<p>Loranthus galpinii, commonly known as the Galpinâ€™s mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is often considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats.</p>
