<p>Leptogramma leptogrammoides, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in anchoring the plant in the substrate.</p>
<p>Leptogramma leptogrammoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
