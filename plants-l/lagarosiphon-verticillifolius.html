                    <h1>Lagarosiphon verticillifolius</h1>
<p>Lagarosiphon verticillifolius, commonly known as the water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, floating or submerged growth habit, with long, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically emerging above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
