                    <h1>Lepidozamia</h1>
<p>Lepidozamia, commonly known as the net-veined cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a stout trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a unique, net-like venation pattern. Lepidozamia species are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants.</p>
<p>These ancient plants are adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
