                    <h1>Lemna orbicularis</h1>
<p>Lemna orbicularis, commonly known as the broad-leaf duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It has rounded, smooth, and waxy leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in nutrient-rich habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its fast growth rate, it can impact water quality and aquatic ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
