<p>Lomatium serpentinum, commonly known as the serpent's root, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils, often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture in arid conditions.</p>
