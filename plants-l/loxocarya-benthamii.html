<p>Loxocarya benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a tightly adherent, foliose thallus that is typically found on bark or rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a pale yellow to orange-colored cortex, with a central medulla that is lighter in color. It is primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental conditions and is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat health.</p>
