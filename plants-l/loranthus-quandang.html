                    <h1>Loranthus quandang</h1>
<p>Loranthus quandang, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, often white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Loranthus quandang is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategy make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
