                    <h1>Litsea macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Litsea macrocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red, fleshy drupes that contain a single seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy fruit.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
