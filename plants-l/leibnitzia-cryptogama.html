<p>Leibnitzia cryptogama, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its evocative common name. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist forest environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are cryptogamous, meaning they do not produce flowers or seeds, relying instead on spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leibnitzia cryptogama is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
