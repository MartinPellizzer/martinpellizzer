                    <h1>Lecythis rigida</h1>
<p>Lecythis rigida, commonly known as the Amazonian oil tree, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces a heavy, oily fruit that contains a valuable seed. The tree's bark and seeds have been used for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various wildlife and its contribution to the rainforest's biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant is also economically significant due to the production of natural oils and its potential in sustainable forestry.</p>
