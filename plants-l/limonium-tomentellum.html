                    <h1>Limonium tomentellum</h1>
<p>Limonium tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its hairy, silver-gray leaves help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Limonium tomentellum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
