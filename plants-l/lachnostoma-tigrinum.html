                    <h1>Lachnostoma tigrinum</h1>
<p>Lachnostoma tigrinum, commonly known as the tiger lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like thallus with a distinctive pattern of dark, tiger-like markings.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on bark, stone, or wood in temperate regions. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and green algae or cyanobacteria, which together carry out photosynthesis. Its structure provides a protective layer against environmental stressors, allowing it to survive in challenging conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
