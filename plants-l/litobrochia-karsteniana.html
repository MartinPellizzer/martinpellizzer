                    <h1>Litobrochia karsteniana</h1>
<p>Litobrochia karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's rock lichen, is a saxicolous lichen that thrives on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark yellowish-green, and it produces distinct, rounded apothecia with a smooth, often reddish margin. It is a chemically complex lichen, containing various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in regions with low humidity and high solar exposure.</p>
