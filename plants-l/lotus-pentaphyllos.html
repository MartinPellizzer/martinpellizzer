                    <h1>Lotus pentaphyllos</h1>
<p>Lotus pentaphyllos, commonly known as the five-leaf water lily, is a rare and ancient aquatic plant native to the Nile River basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a unique habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>Lotus pentaphyllos has been historically significant in Egyptian culture and is considered a symbol of purity and rebirth.</p>
