                    <h1>Lupinus lanatocarinus</h1>
<p>Lupinus lanatocarinus, commonly known as the woolly lupin, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and spiny stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Lupinus lanatocarinus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation.</p>
