<p>Lotus gebelia, commonly known as the Persian water-lily, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, which are often covered in a waxy coating to repel water. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes are often harvested for medicinal purposes in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The lotus gebelia plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and helping to stabilize water ecosystems.</p>
