                    <h1>Loranthus exocarpi f. breviflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus exocarpi f. breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while performing photosynthesis using its scale-like structures. It produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
