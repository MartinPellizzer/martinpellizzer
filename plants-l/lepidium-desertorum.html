<p>Lepidium desertorum, commonly known as desert mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Lepidium desertorum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
