                    <h1>Loranthus stenopetalus</h1>
<p>Loranthus stenopetalus, commonly known as the narrow-petaled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
