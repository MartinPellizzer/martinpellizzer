<p>Lythrum portula, commonly known as purple loosestrife, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, spike-like clusters of violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped, opposite, and covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>Lythrum portula is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and vegetative reproduction, making it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
