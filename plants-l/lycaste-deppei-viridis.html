<p>Lycaste deppei viridis, commonly known as the Emerald Lycaste, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in rocky or wooded habitats. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
