                    <h1>Leersia disticha</h1>
<p>Leersia disticha, commonly known as common leersia, is a perennial grass native to Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Leersia disticha is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
