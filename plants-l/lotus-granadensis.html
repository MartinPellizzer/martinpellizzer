                    <h1>Lotus granadensis</h1>
<p>Lotus granadensis, commonly known as the Granada lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy stems. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often submerged, helping to stabilize the sediment in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Lotus granadensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
