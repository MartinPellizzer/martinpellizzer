<p>Leucocarpus fruticosus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rhizophoraceae family and is characterized by its aerial roots, which help stabilize the plant in tidal environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, aiding in its dispersal by water and animals.</p>
