                    <h1>Loranthus cinereus</h1>
<p>Loranthus cinereus, commonly known as the ash mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of ash trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions and is considered a significant component of forest ecosystems.</p>
