                    <h1>Lemeltonia cornuta</h1>
<p>Lemeltonia cornuta, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, elongated leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its milky sap contains latex, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Lemeltonia cornuta plays an important role in local ecosystems by supporting native insect populations.</p>
