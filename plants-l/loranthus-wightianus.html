                    <h1>Loranthus wightianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus wightianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are usually red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus wightianus is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
