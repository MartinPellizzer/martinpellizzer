                    <h1>Loranthus namaquensis var. ligustrifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus namaquensis var. ligustrifolius, commonly known as the Namaqua mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the succulent karoo region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are often clustered in whorls, and its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are a food source for various birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
