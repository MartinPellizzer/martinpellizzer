                    <h1>Loranthus luteostriatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus luteostriatus, commonly known as the yellow-striped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating propagation.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and tropical regions.</p>
