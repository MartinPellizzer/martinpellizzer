                    <h1>Loranthus tsaratanensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus tsaratanensis, commonly known as the Madagascar mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees in Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients directly from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
