                    <h1>Loranthus macrostachys</h1>
<p>Loranthus macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
