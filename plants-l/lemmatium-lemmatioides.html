                <h1>Lemmatium lemmatioides</h1>
<p>Lemmatium lemmatioides, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a complex symbiotic relationship between a fungus and green algae or cyanobacteria, which together provide the plant with nutrients. The thallus is usually bright yellow or greenish-yellow, with a soft, leathery texture. It often grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
