<p>Loranthus albizziae var. rogersii, commonly known as the rogersii mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily species of the genus Albizia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces white to pale yellow berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
