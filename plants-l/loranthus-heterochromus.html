                    <h1>Loranthus heterochromus</h1>
<p>Loranthus heterochromus, commonly known as the heterochromatic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Africa, including parts of South Africa. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its parasitic nature and role in forest ecosystems.</p>
