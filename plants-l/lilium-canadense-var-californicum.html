                    <h1>Lilium canadense var. californicum</h1>
<p>Lilium canadense var. californicum, commonly known as the California fritillary, is a striking bulbous perennial native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with red markings, resembling fritillary butterflies. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, erect stem that supports its ornamental blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in meadows and open woodlands.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more robust growth and broader distribution compared to the typical L. canadense.</p>
