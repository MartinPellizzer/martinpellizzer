<p>Limeum linifolium var. polygonoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed limeum, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the base of the plant. The species is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant's adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
