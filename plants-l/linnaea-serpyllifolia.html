<p>Linnaea serpyllifolia, commonly known as the common wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits.
