                    <h1>Lacellia libyca</h1>
<p>Lacellia libyca, commonly known as the Libyan lichen, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits specific botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Teloschistaceae and is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in North Africa. The plant forms a crustose thallus, which is tightly adhered to the substrate, often rock or soil surfaces. Its growth is slow, and it is adapted to withstand extreme environmental conditions such as high temperatures and low moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Lacellia libyca is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
