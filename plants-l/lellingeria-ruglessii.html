<p>Lellingeria ruglessii, commonly known as the rugless lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pertusariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose and forms a tight, adherent layer on its substrate. The lichen's morphology includes a finely granular surface and a distinct, often pale or yellowish coloration. It is usually found growing on rocks, tree bark, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
