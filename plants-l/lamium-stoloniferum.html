                    <h1>Lamium stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Lamium stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy undersides and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties.</p>
