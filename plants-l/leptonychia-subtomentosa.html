<p>Leptonychia subtomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it thrives in slow-moving water. Its leaves are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss and provides camouflage.</p>
<p>Leptonychia subtomentosa is an important part of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for various aquatic invertebrates.</p>
