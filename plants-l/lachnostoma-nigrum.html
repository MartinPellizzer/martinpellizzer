                    <h1>Lachnostoma nigrum</h1>
<p>Lachnostoma nigrum, commonly known as the black lichen, is a species of crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, thallus that can appear velvety or crust-like in texture. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It is often found on bark, stones, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
