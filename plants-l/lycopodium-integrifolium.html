<p>Lycopodium integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping stem with erect, needle-like leaves that are entire and smooth to the touch. It produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia that release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Lycopodium integrifolium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
