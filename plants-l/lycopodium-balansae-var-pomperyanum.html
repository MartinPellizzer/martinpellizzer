                    <h1>Lycopodium balansae var. pomperyanum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium balansae var. pomperyanum, commonly known as the Pompeian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its historical association with the ancient city of Pompeii, where it was found preserved in volcanic ash.</p>
