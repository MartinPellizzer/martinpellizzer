                    <h1>Leptospermum erubescens var. psilocalyx</h1>
<p>Leptospermum erubescens var. psilocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves contain high levels of essential oils, making it valuable for both medicinal and aromatic purposes.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its reduced calyx lobes, which are shorter and more narrow than in the typical form of the species.</p>
