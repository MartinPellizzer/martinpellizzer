                    <h1>Leptoseris</h1>
<p>Leptoseris, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of marine algae belonging to the family Halymeda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its calcified, branching thallus that forms a skeleton-like structure. The plant typically grows in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, often found on coral reefs and rocky substrates. Leptoseris species are important in marine ecosystems, contributing to reef structure and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>They reproduce both sexually and asexually, with spores and vegetative propagation playing key roles in their life cycle.</p>
