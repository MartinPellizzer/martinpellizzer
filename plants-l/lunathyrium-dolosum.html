                    <h1>Lunathyrium dolosum</h1>
<p>Lunathyrium dolosum, commonly known as the deceptive moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers open only at night, closing shortly after dawn, which is an adaptation to its specific pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lunathyrium dolosum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
