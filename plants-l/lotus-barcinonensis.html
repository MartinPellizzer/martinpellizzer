                    <h1>Lotus barcinonensis</h1>
<p>Lotus barcinonensis, commonly known as the Barbary lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water, typically from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Lotus barcinonensis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
