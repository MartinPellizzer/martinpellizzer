<p>Lithocarpus confinis, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree native to the Philippines, characterized by its hard, dense wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland to montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered an important but threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
