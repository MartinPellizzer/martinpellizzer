                    <h1>Limbarda tricuspis</h1>
<p>Limbarda tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed petals and sepals, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or along rocky outcrops. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, producing small, fragrant blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Limbarda tricuspis is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species.</p>
