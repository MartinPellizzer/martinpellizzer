                    <h1>Loranthus kamerunensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus kamerunensis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforest regions of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. As a hemiparasite, it derives some of its nutrients from the host plant but can also perform limited photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
