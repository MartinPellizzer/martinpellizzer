<p>Limodorum utriculatum, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like structure at the base of its leaf, which is believed to aid in water retention. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
