<p>Louteridium chartaceum, commonly known as the paper lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a thin, leaf-like structure with a pale green to yellowish upper surface and a darker, granular lower surface. The plant is characterized by its delicate, papery texture and is often found on tree bark or rocks. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, it is often used as an indicator of environmental health.</p>
