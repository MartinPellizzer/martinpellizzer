                    <h1>Loranthus nutans</h1>
<p>Loranthus nutans, commonly known as the nodding mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish-yellow, and its berries are red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds. Loranthus nutans is native to Australia and parts of Asia, where it thrives in a variety of forested environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
