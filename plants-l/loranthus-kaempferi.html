                    <h1>Loranthus kaempferi</h1>
<p>Loranthus kaempferi, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus kaempferi is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa.</p>
