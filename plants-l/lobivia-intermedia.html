<p>Lobivia intermedia, commonly known as the Intermediate Lobivia, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical or slightly branched stems that are often ribbed and covered in white to grayish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Lobivia intermedia is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
