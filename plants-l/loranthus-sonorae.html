                    <h1>Loranthus sonorae</h1>
<p>Loranthus sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the Sonoran Desert region.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round berries that contain sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>Loranthus sonorae plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for wildlife and influencing the growth of its host trees.</p>
