                    <h1>Liparis gjellerupii</h1>
<p>Liparis gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of northern Scandinavia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer, featuring a unique combination of white and green hues. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its growth is closely tied to specific microhabitats, often found on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Liparis gjellerupii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
