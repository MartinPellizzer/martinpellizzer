                    <h1>Loranthus dodensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus dodensis, commonly known as the Dod's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often visited by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both ecological and economic impacts on the host trees it infests.</p>
