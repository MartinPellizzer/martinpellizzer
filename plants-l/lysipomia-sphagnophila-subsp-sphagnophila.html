<p>Lysipomia sphagnophila subsp.</p>
<p>sphagnophila, commonly known as the bog pearlwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and peatlands. It typically grows in dense clusters, with small, rosette-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are adapted to retain moisture, a crucial feature for survival in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely associated with sphagnum moss, forming a characteristic ecological partnership in peatland ecosystems.</p>
