                            <h1>Lactuca Scariola</h1>
<p>Lactuca scariola, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a wild plant that thrives in disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and a distinctive flowering head that resembles a small lettuce. This species is often found along roadsides, fields, and in rocky areas where it can take advantage of open spaces. Despite its name, it is not related to cultivated lettuce and has a different chemical composition. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
