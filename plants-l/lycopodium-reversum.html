<p>Lycopodium reversum, commonly known as the reverse clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Lycopodium reversum typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest.</p>
