                    <h1>Limodorum pusillum</h1>
<p>Limodorum pusillum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a small, perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, inconspicuous flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungi for most of its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats and is often found in association with specific fungal networks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
