<p>Lathyrus diffusus, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, often appearing in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Lathyrus diffusus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
