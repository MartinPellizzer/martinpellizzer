<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is an evergreen vine that can climb using its tendrils, often reaching lengths of several meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
