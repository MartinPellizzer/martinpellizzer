<p>Lichtensteinia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lichen, is a member of the Lichenes family.</p>
<p>It is a non-photosynthetic organism that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rock surfaces. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body made up of the fungal and algal components.</p>
<p>Lichtensteinia latifolia plays an important role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
