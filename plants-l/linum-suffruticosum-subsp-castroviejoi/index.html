                            <h1>Linum Suffruticosum Subsp. Castroviejoi</h1>
<p>Castroviejoi flax, scientifically known as Linum suffruticosum subsp. castroviejoi, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. This subspecies is distinguished by its striking blue flowers and robust, hairy stems that thrive in rocky and arid environments. It is closely related to common flax, but its ecological niche and limited distribution set it apart from its more widespread relatives. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Castroviejoi flax faces increasing threats to its survival. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this botanical treasure for future generations.</p>
