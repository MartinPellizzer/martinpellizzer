<p>Lonicera hypoglauca subsp.</p>
<p>nudiflora, commonly known as the nakedflower honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The berries that follow the flowers are orange-red and edible, though not as widely consumed as those of other honeysuckle species.</p>
