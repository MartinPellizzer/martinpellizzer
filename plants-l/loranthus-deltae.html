                    <h1>Loranthus deltae</h1>
<p>Loranthus deltae, commonly known as the delta mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Loranthus deltae is native to Australia and is an important component of the region's ecological systems.</p>
