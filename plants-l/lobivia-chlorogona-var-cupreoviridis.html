<p>Lobivia chlorogona var. cupreoviridis, commonly known as the Copperleaf Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish or coppery hue. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
