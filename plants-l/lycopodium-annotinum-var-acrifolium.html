                    <h1>Lycopodium annotinum var. acrifolium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium annotinum var. acrifolium, commonly known as the black fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system and produces spore-bearing fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant's fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided, needle-like segments that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle.</p>
