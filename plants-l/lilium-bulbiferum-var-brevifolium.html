<p>Lilium bulbiferum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fritillary, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking violet to purple flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its bulbs are an important part of its reproductive cycle, producing offsets that help in propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
