                    <h1>Lophophora williamsii var. diffusa</h1>
<p>Lophophora williamsii var. diffusa, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a variant of the Peyote cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spineless stems and the presence of a unique, seed-containing pod that moves when disturbed. The plant contains mescaline, a psychoactive alkaloid, and is often cultivated for its medicinal and ritualistic uses. It thrives in arid conditions with well-draining soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its legal status and conservation concerns, it is typically grown in controlled environments.</p>
