<p>Licania anisophylla, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, bark-like exodermis and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries.</p>
<p>Licania anisophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
