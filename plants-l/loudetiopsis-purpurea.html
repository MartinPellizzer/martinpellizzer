<p>Loudetiopsis purpurea, commonly known as the purple moss or purple carpet moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing mats of foliage that form a vibrant purple hue, especially under bright light conditions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rock crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and possess a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain water.</p>
<p>Loudetiopsis purpurea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
