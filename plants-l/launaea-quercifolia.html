                    <h1>Launaea quercifolia</h1>
<p>Launaea quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved launaea, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. Launaea quercifolia is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
