                    <h1>Leontopodium stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Leontopodium stoloniferum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows in rocky, high-altitude environments where it forms a cushion-like structure to withstand harsh weather conditions. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming colonies that help stabilize soil in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is also a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions.</p>
