                    <h1>Limbarda pinifolia</h1>
<p>Limbarda pinifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray upper surface and a darker, more leathery underside. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
