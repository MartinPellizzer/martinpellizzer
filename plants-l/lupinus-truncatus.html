                    <h1>Lupinus truncatus</h1>
<p>Lupinus truncatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with a narrow, linear shape and is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
<p>Lupinus truncatus is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
