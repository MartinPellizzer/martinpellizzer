                    <h1>Lysipomia subpeltata</h1>
<p>Lysipomia subpeltata, commonly known as the hairy leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It has a pale green to yellowish thallus with a dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called rhizines. The plant forms symbiotic associations with cyanobacteria, which contribute to its ability to fix nitrogen. It is typically found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
