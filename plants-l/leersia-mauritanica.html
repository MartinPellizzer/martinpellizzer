                    <h1>Leersia mauritanica</h1>
<p>Leersia mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can thrive in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Leersia mauritanica is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
