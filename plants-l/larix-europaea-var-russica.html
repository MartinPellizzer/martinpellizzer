                    <h1>Larix europaea var. russica</h1>
<p>Larix europaea var. russica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in harsh, boreal environments. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically light green and turn golden before falling in autumn, contributing to the seasonal beauty of the landscape.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in reforestation efforts in northern regions.</p>
