<p>Lepigonum rubrum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed fireweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woods. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
