                    <h1>Lepturus repens var. cinereus</h1>
<p>Lepturus repens var. cinereus, commonly known as the silver carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
