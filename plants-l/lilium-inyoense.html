                    <h1>Lilium inyoense</h1>
<p>Lilium inyoense, commonly known as the Inyo lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>This perennial herbaceous plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine environments. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinct red or purple blotch at the base. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single stem that supports its floral display.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium inyoense is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
