<p>Lycopodium erythrocaulon, commonly known as the red-stem clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, carpet-like growths. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodium erythrocaulon thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
