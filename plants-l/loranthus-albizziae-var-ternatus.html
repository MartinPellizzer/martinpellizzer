                    <h1>Loranthus albizziae var. ternatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus albizziae var. ternatus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily from the genus Albizia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on the fleshy, red berries it produces.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa.</p>
