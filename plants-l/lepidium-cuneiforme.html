                    <h1>Lepidium cuneiforme</h1>
<p>Lepidium cuneiforme, commonly known as peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, triangular seed pods.</p>
<p>Peppergrass has a low-growing habit and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
