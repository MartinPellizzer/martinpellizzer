<p>Lachnagrostis adamsonii subsp.</p>
<p>adamsonii, commonly known as Adamsonâ€™s hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with reddish hues.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with narrow leaves that reduce water loss and deep root systems for moisture retention. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
