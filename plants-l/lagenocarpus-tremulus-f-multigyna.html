                    <h1>Lagenocarpus tremulus f. multigyna</h1>
<p>Lagenocarpus tremulus f. multigyna, commonly known as the variable tremulous lagenocarpus, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its unique reproductive structures.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is distinguished by its multigynous flowers, which bear multiple pistils on a single inflorescence. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its genetic variability and potential ecological role in specific habitats.</p>
