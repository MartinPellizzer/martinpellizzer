                    <h1>Loranthus congestus</h1>
<p>Loranthus congestus, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth pattern. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that absorb nutrients from the host. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are often clustered and appear in the axils of the stems.</p>
<p>Loranthus congestus produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds, facilitating its spread to new host trees.</p>
