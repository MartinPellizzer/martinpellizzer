                    <h1>Lithoplis saxatilis</h1>
<p>Lithoplis saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found on stone surfaces in temperate and cold regions. The plant's structure is characterized by a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. It plays a vital role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
