<p>Lappula inconspicua, commonly known as the common lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in fields, and near water sources. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in loose umbels, and the fruit is a hairy, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Lappula inconspicua is known for its low-growing habit and is often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance.</p>
