                    <h1>Lycopodium balansae</h1>
<p>Lycopodium balansae, commonly known as the Balansae clubmoss, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant's reproductive system relies on wind pollination, and its spores are dispersed over long distances.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Lycopodium balansae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages.</p>
