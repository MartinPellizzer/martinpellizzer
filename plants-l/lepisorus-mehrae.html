                    <h1>Lepisorus mehrae</h1>
<p>Lepisorus mehrae, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricately veined leaves that are typically borne on long, wiry stalks. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Lepisorus mehrae is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
