                    <h1>Lilium lophophorum f. wardii</h1>
<p>Lilium lophophorum f. wardii, commonly known as the Ward's fawn lily, is a rare and striking variant of the fawn lily species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-red flowers with a distinctive white throat, which sets it apart from other members of the Lilium genus. Native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of broad, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring, preceding the flowering period.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
