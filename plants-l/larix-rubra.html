                    <h1>Larix rubra</h1>
<p>Larix rubra, commonly known as the red larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking reddish-brown bark and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needle-like leaves turn a vivid yellow before falling in autumn, contributing to its seasonal beauty.</p>
<p>The red larch is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
