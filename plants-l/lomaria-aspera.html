<p>Lomaria aspera, commonly known as the rough lomaria, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and have a distinctive, rough surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lomaria aspera is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
