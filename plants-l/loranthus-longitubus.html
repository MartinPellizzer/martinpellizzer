                    <h1>Loranthus longitubus</h1>
<p>Loranthus longitubus, commonly known as the long-tube mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to a host tree through its roots, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and typically grows on the branches of broadleaf trees. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
