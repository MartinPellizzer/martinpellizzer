                    <h1>Luzula sudetica var. frigida</h1>
<p>Luzula sudetica var. frigida, commonly known as the alpine wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of mountain ecosystems.</p>
