                    <h1>Loranthus coccineus</h1>
<p>Loranthus coccineus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal. It is native to Australia and thrives in warm, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in supporting bird populations that feed on its berries.</p>
