                    <h1>Loranthus togoensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus togoensis, commonly known as the Togo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the savanna regions of West Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Loranthus togoensis plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects, while also affecting the growth of its host trees.</p>
