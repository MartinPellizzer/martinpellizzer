<p>Leiothrix sclerophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
