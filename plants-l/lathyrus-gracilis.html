                    <h1>Lathyrus gracilis</h1>
<p>Lathyrus gracilis, commonly known as slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple or white, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Lathyrus gracilis is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
