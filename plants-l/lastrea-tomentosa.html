                    <h1>Lastrea tomentosa</h1>
<p>Lastrea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating that covers its stems and leaves, providing protection against intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The flowers, when they appear, are usually small and yellow, adding a subtle touch of color to the plant's otherwise muted appearance.</p>
