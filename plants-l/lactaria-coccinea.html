                    <h1>Lactaria coccinea</h1>
<p>Lactaria coccinea, commonly known as the red milk cap, is a species of fungi that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid orange to reddish-brown cap and a stem that is often lighter in color. The fungus produces a milky, latex-like substance when the cap is cut, which is a key identifying feature. It typically grows in woodland areas, often associated with coniferous trees.</p>
<p>Lactaria coccinea is edible when young but can become toxic with age, making it an important species to identify correctly.</p>
