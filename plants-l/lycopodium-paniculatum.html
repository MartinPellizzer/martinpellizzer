                    <h1>Lycopodium paniculatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium paniculatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a branching, creeping stem that often forms dense mats. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte phase is dominant in its life cycle. Lycopodium paniculatum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its historical significance in paleobotany highlights its role in the evolution of early land plants.</p>
