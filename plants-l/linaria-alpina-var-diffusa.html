                    <h1>Linaria alpina var. diffusa</h1>
<p>Linaria alpina var. diffusa, commonly known as the Alpine toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble elongated tubes. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>This variant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, dainty blooms.</p>
