<p>Leucothoe pistrix, commonly known as the purpleleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the top and silvery-white on the underside, creating a striking contrast. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in early spring. These flowers give way to small, red berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Leucothoe pistrix thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
