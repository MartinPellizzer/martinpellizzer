                            <h1>Linaria Alpina Subsp. Filicaulis</h1>
<p>Linaria alpina subsp. filicaulis is a lesser-known member of the snapdragon family known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and vibrant, tubular flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure in horticultural circles compared to its more popular relatives. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
