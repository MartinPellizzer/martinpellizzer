                    <h1>Loranthus campestris</h1>
<p>Loranthus campestris, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as apple, hawthorn, and poplar.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its berries, which are usually red, are consumed by birds that help disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This parasitic plant has cultural significance in various traditions, particularly in Christmas celebrations.</p>
