                    <h1>Loranthus creatophyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus creatophyllus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through partial photosynthesis. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruits are fleshy and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain animals and influencing the health of its host trees.</p>
