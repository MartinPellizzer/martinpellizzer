<p>Lobadium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three parts.
