<p>Leitneria pilosa subsp.</p>
<p>ozarkana, commonly known as Ozark leatherleaf, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elliptical, red-brown fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
