                    <h1>Lemna minuscula</h1>
<p>Lemna minuscula, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation, making it highly adaptable.</p>
<p>Lemna minuscula is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
