                    <h1>Loranthus pulcher var. sessiliflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus pulcher var. sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its roots.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, white or pale yellow berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it forms a symbiotic relationship with various host species.</p>
