<p>Leucophyllum virescens, commonly known as silverleaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its leaves are aromatic and contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive scent.</p>
