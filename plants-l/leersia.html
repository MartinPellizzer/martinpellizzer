                    <h1>Leersia</h1>
<p>Leersia, commonly known as common leersia, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to Asia, Africa, and the Americas, often found in moist or wetland habitats. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered spikelets as inflorescences. They are often used in ornamental gardening due to their delicate appearance and ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Leersia species are also important in ecological studies due to their role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
