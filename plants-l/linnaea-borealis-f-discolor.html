                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. discolor</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. discolor, commonly known as the white twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow of the species, and its small, opposite leaves. The plant is a low-growing evergreen shrub, often found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans.</p>
<p>This rare form is of interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and limited distribution.</p>
