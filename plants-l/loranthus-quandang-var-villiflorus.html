                    <h1>Loranthus quandang var. villiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus quandang var. villiflorus, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing small seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to regions of China and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
