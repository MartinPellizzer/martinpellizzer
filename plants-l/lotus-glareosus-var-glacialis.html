<p>Lotus glareosus var. glacialis, commonly known as the glacier lotus, is a rare and striking plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has a robust root system adapted to cold, rocky environments, allowing it to thrive in harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are broad and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
