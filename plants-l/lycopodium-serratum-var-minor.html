                    <h1>Lycopodium serratum var. minor</h1>
<p>Lycopodium serratum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are characteristic of its primitive evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden conditions.</p>
