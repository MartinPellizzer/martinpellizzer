<p>Laretia yareta, commonly known as the Andean rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Laretia yareta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>
