<p>Larix decidua subsp.</p>
<p>sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that turn gold in autumn before shedding.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its bark is typically thin and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
