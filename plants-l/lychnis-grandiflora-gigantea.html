                    <h1>Lychnis grandiflora gigantea</h1>
<p>Lychnis grandiflora gigantea, commonly known as the giant fireweed, is a strikingly tall perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its sturdy stem. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor, cold environments.</p>
<p>Lychnis grandiflora gigantea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological succession in disturbed habitats.</p>
