                    <h1>Lycium crassifolium</h1>
<p>Lycium crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a resilient plant in xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Lycium crassifolium is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive with minimal water.</p>
