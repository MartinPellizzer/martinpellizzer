<p>Leptochilus sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak leek orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in mossy areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it faces threats to its survival in the wild.</p>
