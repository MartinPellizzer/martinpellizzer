<p>It is characterized by its small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in salty, well-drained soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate salt spray.</p>
<p>Limonium proliferum is also a popular choice for dried floral arrangements.</p>
