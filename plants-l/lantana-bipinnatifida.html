                    <h1>Lantana bipinnatifida</h1>
<p>Lantana bipinnatifida, commonly known as the fragrant lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bipinnatifid, meaning they are divided into two sets of small, thread-like leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some areas, requiring careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
