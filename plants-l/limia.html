                    <h1>Limia</h1>
<p>Limia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it a common sight in coastal areas. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy soils and facilitate gas exchange. Limia produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by water, aiding in its propagation along tidal zones.</p>
