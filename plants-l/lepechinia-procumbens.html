                    <h1>Lepechinia procumbens</h1>
<p>Lepechinia procumbens, commonly known as creeping lepechinia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, forest edges, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is an important component of local ecosystems.</p>
