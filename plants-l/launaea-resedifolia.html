                    <h1>Launaea resedifolia</h1>
<p>Launaea resedifolia, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or perennial herb with hairy, fleshy stems that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, often lobed, and adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Launaea resedifolia is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
