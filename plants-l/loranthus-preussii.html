                    <h1>Loranthus preussii</h1>
<p>Loranthus preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of the host tree.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Europe and is often considered a rare and ecologically significant component of forest ecosystems.</p>
