                    <h1>Leptorkis barbata</h1>
<p>Leptorkis barbata, commonly known as the barbed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically yellowish to greenish in color, and features distinct, barbed lobes that give it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
