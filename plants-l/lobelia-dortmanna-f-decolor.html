The plant features small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which distinguish it from the more brightly colored forms of the species. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its reduced pigmentation, giving it a distinctive, subdued appearance compared to the typical lobelia.</p>
