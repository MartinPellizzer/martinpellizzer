<p>Lobelia marryattiae, commonly known as the Marryatt's lobelia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, tubular blue or purple flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats, typically in forest understories or along stream banks. Its narrow range and habitat specificity make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>
