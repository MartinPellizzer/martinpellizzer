                    <h1>Litothamnus nitidus</h1>
<p>Litothamnus nitidus, commonly known as the smooth rock-moss, is a member of the Lithothamnaceae family and is characterized by its calcified, crust-like structure.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, coastal environments, particularly in the intertidal zones of the Pacific Northwest. The plant forms a dense, green to reddish-brown crust that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. It is a photosynthetic organism that plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique structure and habitat, it is considered an important indicator of marine environmental conditions.</p>
