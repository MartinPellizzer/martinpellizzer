<p>Linaria alpina subsp.</p>
<p>guarensis, commonly known as the Alpine toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, adapting to harsh, alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
