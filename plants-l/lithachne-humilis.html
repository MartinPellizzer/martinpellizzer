                    <h1>Lithachne humilis</h1>
<p>Lithachne humilis, commonly known as the dwarf panic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Lithachne humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
