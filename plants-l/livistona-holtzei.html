<p>Livistona holtzei, commonly known as the Holtze's palm, is a species of cycad native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
