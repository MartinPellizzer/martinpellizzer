                    <h1>Leucopogon corifolius</h1>
<p>Leucopogon corifolius, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas subject to salt spray. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Leucopogon corifolius is well adapted to coastal conditions and is often found in heathlands and dunes.</p>
