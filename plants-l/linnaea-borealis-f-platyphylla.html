                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, opposite, broad elliptical leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
