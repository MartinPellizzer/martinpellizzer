This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
