                    <h1>Lotus glomeratus</h1>
<p>Lotus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has long, slender stems that float on the water's surface, with leaves that are broad and heart-shaped. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it a common sight in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Lotus glomeratus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
