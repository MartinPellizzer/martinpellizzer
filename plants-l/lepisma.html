                    <h1>Lepisma</h1>
<p>Lepisma, commonly known as the silverfish, is not a plant but an insect.</p>
<p>However, it is often mistaken for a plant due to its appearance. It belongs to the order Thysanura and is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and three pairs of legs. Silverfish are typically found in damp, dark environments.</p>
<p>They feed on starches, sugars, and other organic materials, making them common household pests.</p>
