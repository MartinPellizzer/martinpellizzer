                    <h1>Leleba ventricosa</h1>
<p>Leleba ventricosa, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the main body consists of the inflated, bladder-like organs.</p>
<p>Leleba ventricosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for various aquatic life.</p>
