                    <h1>Loranthus cubensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that contain seeds. It is found primarily in the Caribbean, particularly in Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree and is often considered a pest in agricultural settings.</p>
