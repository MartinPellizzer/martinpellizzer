                    <h1>Lastrea pumila</h1>
<p>Lastrea pumila, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
