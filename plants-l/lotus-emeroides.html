<p>Lotus emeroides, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white, often floating on the surface of still waters. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that repels water. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water.</p>
<p>The lotus is renowned for its symbolic significance in various cultures and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, still water environments.</p>
