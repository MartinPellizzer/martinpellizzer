                    <h1>Loranthus scassellatii</h1>
<p>Loranthus scassellatii, commonly known as the Italian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the natural cycle of host trees.</p>
<p>Its presence can influence the growth and health of the host, sometimes leading to weakened or stressed trees.</p>
