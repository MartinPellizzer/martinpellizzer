                    <h1>Lupinus nemoralis</h1>
<p>Lupinus nemoralis, commonly known as the wood lupin, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus nemoralis is often found in woodland edges, heaths, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>
