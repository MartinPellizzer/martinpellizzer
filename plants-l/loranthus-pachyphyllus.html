                    <h1>Loranthus pachyphyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus pachyphyllus, commonly known as the thick-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that reduce water loss, an adaptation to its epiphytic lifestyle. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its small, leathery leaves. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating further colonization.</p>
