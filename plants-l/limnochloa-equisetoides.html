<p>Limnochloa equisetoides, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, needle-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance, resembling that of a clubmoss. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its preference for partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Limnochloa equisetoides plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
