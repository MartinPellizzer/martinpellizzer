                    <h1>Lastrea erosa</h1>
<p>Lastrea erosa, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing succulent native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with pale green, hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which provide additional protection against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Lastrea erosa is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
