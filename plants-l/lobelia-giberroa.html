<p>Lobelia giberroa, commonly known as the mountain lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Lobelia giberroa is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
