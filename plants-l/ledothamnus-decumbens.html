<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and is often found on rocky substrates or in forest floors. The plant exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship with algae, which contributes to its green coloration and nutrient acquisition. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often overlooked but plays a vital role in soil stabilization and ecosystem health.</p>
