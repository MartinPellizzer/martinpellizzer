                    <h1>Lepanthes mulderae</h1>
<p>Lepanthes mulderae, commonly known as the Mulder's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a white lip, which are typically small and delicate. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
