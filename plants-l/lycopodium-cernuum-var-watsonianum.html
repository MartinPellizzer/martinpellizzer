<p>Lycopodium cernuum var. watsonianum, commonly known as the Watson's clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of prostrate stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, acidic soils.</p>
