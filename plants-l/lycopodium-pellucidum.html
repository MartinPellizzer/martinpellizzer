<p>Lycopodium pellucidum, commonly known as the glassy clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear whorls of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Native to moist, shaded environments in the Appalachian region of the United States, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in forest understories and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
