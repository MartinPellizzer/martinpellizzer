                    <h1>Leptogramma huishuiensis</h1>
<p>Leptogramma huishuiensis, commonly known as the HuiShui leptogramma, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
