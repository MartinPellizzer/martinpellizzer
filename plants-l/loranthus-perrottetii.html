                    <h1>Loranthus perrottetii</h1>
<p>Loranthus perrottetii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of new host trees.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
