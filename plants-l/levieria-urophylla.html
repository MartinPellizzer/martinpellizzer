                    <h1>Levieria urophylla</h1>
<p>Levieria urophylla, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, soft, silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to thrive in sandy soils with limited moisture.</p>
<p>Levieria urophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
