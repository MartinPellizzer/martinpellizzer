                    <h1>Loranthus breyeri</h1>
<p>Loranthus breyeri, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often overlooked. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species is found in parts of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia, where it grows on a variety of host trees.</p>
