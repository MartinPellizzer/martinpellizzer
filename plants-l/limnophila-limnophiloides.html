<p>Limnophila limnophiloides, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, finely divided leaves that float on the water surface, with roots extending into the substrate. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Limnophila limnophiloides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
