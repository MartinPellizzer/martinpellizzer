                    <h1>Loranthus riggenbachii</h1>
<p>Loranthus riggenbachii, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
