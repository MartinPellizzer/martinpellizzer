<p>Lacmellea, commonly known as the lace lichen, is a type of foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus that is usually pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the algae providing photosynthetic capabilities and the fungi offering structural support. Lacmellea typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
