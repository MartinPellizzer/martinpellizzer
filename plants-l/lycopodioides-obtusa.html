                    <h1>Lycopodioides obtusa</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the tips of the branches. Lycopodioides obtusa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
