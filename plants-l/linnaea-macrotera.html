<p>Linnaea macrotera, commonly known as the broad-leafed twinflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers.

Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, oval berries that are edible but not particularly nutritious.</p>
<p>Linnaea macrotera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
