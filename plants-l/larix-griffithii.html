                    <h1>Larix griffithii</h1>
<p>Larix griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's larch, is a species of larch native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree that produces small, cone-like structures containing seeds. The tree has needle-like leaves that turn yellow in the autumn before falling off, a unique characteristic among conifers. It typically grows in high-altitude regions and is adapted to cold and harsh climates.</p>
<p>The bark of Griffith's larch is often thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors.</p>
