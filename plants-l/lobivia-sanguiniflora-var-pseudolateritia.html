<p>Lobivia sanguiniflora var. pseudolateritia, commonly known as the "Bloodflower" or "Red Lobivia," is a compact, succulent cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of fleshy, ribbed stems that are typically greenish-gray with a bluish tint. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range from red to deep pink, often blooming in spring. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
