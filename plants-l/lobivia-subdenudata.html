<p>Lobivia subdenudata, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thin layer of white, waxy material. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Lobivia subdenudata is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant.</p>
