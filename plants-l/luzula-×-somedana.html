                    <h1>Luzula × somedana</h1>
<p>Luzula × somedana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Luzula sylvatica and Luzula nivea.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and narrow, with a fibrous root system. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typical of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and is often propagated through vegetative means.</p>
