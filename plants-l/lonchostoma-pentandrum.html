<p>Lonchostoma pentandrum, commonly known as the five-stamen bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rootless, floating stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in North America and parts of Europe. It has five stamens and a distinctive, spurred flower that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by capturing prey to supplement its nutritional needs.</p>
