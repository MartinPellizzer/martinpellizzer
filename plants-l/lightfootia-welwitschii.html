                    <h1>Lightfootia welwitschii</h1>
<p>Lightfootia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique succulent native to Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant has a short, woody stem and can grow up to several meters in height. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early morning.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and rarity, it is considered a living fossil and a symbol of resilience in harsh climates.</p>
