<p>Lelya, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Lelya thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ability to bloom continuously throughout the year makes it a favorite among indoor gardeners.</p>
