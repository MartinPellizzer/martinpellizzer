                    <h1>Lycopodium lucidulum f. porophilum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium lucidulum f. porophilum, commonly known as the Porophilum clubmoss, is a rare fern ally characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to specific regions in the southeastern United States. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with elongated, slender stems that bear whorls of tiny, bright green leaves. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many lycophytes.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its dense, porose (pore-bearing) spore capsules, which contribute to its specific epithet "porophilum.".</p>
