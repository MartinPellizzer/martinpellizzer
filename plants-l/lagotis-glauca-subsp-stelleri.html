<p>Lagotis glauca subsp.</p>
<p>stelleri, commonly known as Steller's lagotis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
