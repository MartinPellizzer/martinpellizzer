<p>Lindsaea subalpina, commonly known as the alpine lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high elevations. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Lindsaea subalpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its alpine habitat and is an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
