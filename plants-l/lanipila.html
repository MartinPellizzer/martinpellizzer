                    <h1>Lanipila</h1>
<p>Lanipila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and small, fragrant flowers. Unlike many orchids, Lanipila lacks a visible root system and instead relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Its habitat is highly specialized, often growing on the surfaces of trees or in swampy areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific environmental needs, Lanipila is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
