                    <h1>Lycopodium alopecuroides var. hoehneanum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium alopecuroides var. hoehneanum, commonly known as the Hoehne's clubmoss, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and dimorphic sporophytes, with distinct stem and leaf structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its leaves are usually scale-like and closely arranged around the stem, contributing to its compact appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
