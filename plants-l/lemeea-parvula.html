                    <h1>Lemeea parvula</h1>
<p>Lemeea parvula, commonly known as the small lemming plant, is a rare and delicate species native to specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and hairy stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Lemeea parvula is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
