<p>Lindsaea panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, fibrous roots and rosette-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Lindsaea panamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
