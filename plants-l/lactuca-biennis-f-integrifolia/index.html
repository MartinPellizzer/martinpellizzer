                            <h1>Lactuca Biennis F. Integrifolia</h1>
<p>Common groundsel, scientifically known as Lactuca biennis f. integrifolia, is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family that thrives in disturbed soils across North America. This biennial plant is characterized by its hairy stems, lobed leaves, and clusters of small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Despite its common name, it is not closely related to lettuce, though it shares some structural similarities. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and can sometimes be found growing along roadsides or in fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed but holds ecological value in certain environments.</p>
