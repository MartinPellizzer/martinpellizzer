                    <h1>Lindsaea gardneri</h1>
<p>Lindsaea gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant features a short, creeping stem with spirally arranged, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Lindsaea gardneri reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is often found in areas with high humidity and limited direct sunlight.</p>
