                    <h1>Limnochloa tumida</h1>
<p>Limnochloa tumida, commonly known as the inflated watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, spongy nodes that store water, allowing it to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its unique morphology makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Limnochloa tumida plays a role in stabilizing wetland sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
