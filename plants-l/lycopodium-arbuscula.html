<p>Lycopodium arbuscula, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are located on specialized stalks called sporophylls. Lycopodium arbuscula typically grows in rocky or forested areas and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its simple, scale-like leaves and distinctive spore-bearing structures make it a unique example of an ancient plant group.</p>
