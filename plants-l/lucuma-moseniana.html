<p>Lucuma moseniana, commonly known as the Mosenian lucuma, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is closely related to the commercially cultivated lucuma (Lucuma lumifera). The plant is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with glossy, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit, which is typically harvested when mature, is encased in a thick, leathery exterior and contains edible, sweet, yellow-orange pulp.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Lucuma moseniana is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
