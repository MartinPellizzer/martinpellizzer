<p>Lecocarpus lecocarpoides subsp.</p>
<p>lecocarpoides, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and aerial roots that help in oxygen absorption.</p>
<p>The plant produces woody, berry-like structures called pneumatophores, which aid in respiration. It thrives in coastal areas, including tidal mudflats and estuaries.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines.</p>
