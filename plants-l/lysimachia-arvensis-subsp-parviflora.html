<p>Lysimachia arvensis subsp.</p>
<p>parviflora, commonly known as narrowleaf chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common weed in cultivated areas.</p>
