                    <h1>Lasianthus foetulentus var. pseudovarians</h1>
<p>Lasianthus foetulentus var. pseudovarians, commonly known as the stinking water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles.</p>
<p>The varietal form, pseudovarians, differs slightly in leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical species.</p>
