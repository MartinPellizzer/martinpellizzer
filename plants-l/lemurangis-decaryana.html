<p>Lemurangis decaryana, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment.</p>
<p>The orchid is primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, making it an important species in its ecosystem.</p>
