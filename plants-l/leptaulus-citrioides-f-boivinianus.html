<p>Leptaulus citrioides f. boivinianus, commonly known as the Boivin's citron lily, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its striking, palm-like appearance with large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as a clump-forming shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with a dense, fibrous trunk covered in a thick, spongy bark. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often producing a fragrant, citrus-like scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts.</p>
