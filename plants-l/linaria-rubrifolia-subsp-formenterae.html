<p>Linaria rubrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>formenterae, commonly known as the Formentera wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and vibrant, orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and a more restricted geographic distribution compared to the broader species. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
