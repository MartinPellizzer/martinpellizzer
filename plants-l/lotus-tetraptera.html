                    <h1>Lotus tetraptera</h1>
<p>Lotus tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Lotus tetraptera plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
