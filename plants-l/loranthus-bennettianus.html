                <h1>Loranthus bennettianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus bennettianus, commonly known as the Bennett's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain sticky seeds, facilitating its propagation by adhering to the feathers of birds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include evergreen foliage and a hemiparasitic lifestyle, relying on the host for water and minerals while performing photosynthesis.</p>
