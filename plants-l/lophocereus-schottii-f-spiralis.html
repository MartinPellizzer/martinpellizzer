                    <h1>Lophocereus schottii f. spiralis</h1>
<p>Lophocereus schottii f. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral cactus or spiral cholla, is a unique variation of the cholla cactus characterized by its spirally arranged branches.</p>
<p>This succulent plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its stems are covered in small, spine-tipped joints that give it a distinctive, branched appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
