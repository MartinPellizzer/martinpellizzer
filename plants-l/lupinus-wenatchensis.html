<p>Lupinus wenatchensis, commonly known as Wenatchee lupine, is a perennial legume native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
