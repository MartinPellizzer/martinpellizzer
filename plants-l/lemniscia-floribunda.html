<p>Lemniscia floribunda, commonly known as the flowering lemniscate, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in clusters along the leaf surfaces. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important indicator species for water quality in aquatic habitats.</p>
