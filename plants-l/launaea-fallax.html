                    <h1>Launaea fallax</h1>
<p>Launaea fallax, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Launaea fallax is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
