                    <h1>Loranthus ciliolatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ciliolatus, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lanceolate, covered with fine, silky hairs, and are typically arranged in pairs along the stem.</p>
<p>Loranthus ciliolatus is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
