<p>Lycopodioides rubella, commonly known as the red moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and the presence of leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant exhibits a thalloid body, which is a flat, ribbon-like structure covered in rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Lycopodioides rubella thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are located on the underside of the thallus, facilitating sexual reproduction in damp conditions.</p>
