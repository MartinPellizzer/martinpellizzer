                    <h1>Lepidocoryphantha runyonii</h1>
<p>Lepidocoryphantha runyonii, commonly known as the Runyon's ghostflower, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has adapted to arid environments with a deep root system and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of desert ecosystems.</p>
