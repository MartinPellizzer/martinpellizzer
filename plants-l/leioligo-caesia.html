                    <h1>Leioligo caesia</h1>
<p>Leioligo caesia, commonly known as the blue leioligo, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Leioligo caesia is considered a conservation concern.</p>
