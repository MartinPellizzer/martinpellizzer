                    <h1>Limniris setosa</h1>
<p>Limniris setosa, commonly known as the hairy water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface and long, hairy stalks that support its showy white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>The hairy setae on its stems and leaves help in reducing water loss and provide a habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
