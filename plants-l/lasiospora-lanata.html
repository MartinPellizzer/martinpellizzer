                    <h1>Lasiospora lanata</h1>
<p>Lasiospora lanata, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, woolly thallus that gives it a soft, fluffy appearance.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions, forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a finely branched structure that allows for efficient photosynthesis. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
