                    <h1>Lathyrus lancifolius</h1>
<p>Lathyrus lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pea, is a perennial legume native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers that range from pink to violet in color. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
