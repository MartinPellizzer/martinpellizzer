<p>Larix dahurica var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate Siberian larch, is a low-growing variant of the Siberian larch native to the taiga regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, with horizontal branches that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are needle-like, typically ranging from 1 to 2 centimeters in length, and are retained for several years before shedding.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental appearance.</p>
