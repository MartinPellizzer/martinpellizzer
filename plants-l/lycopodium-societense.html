<p>Lycopodium societense, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and often gnarled trunk, which can grow up to 15 meters tall. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense, flat sprays, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
