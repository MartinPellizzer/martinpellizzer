                    <h1>Leptopus hirtus</h1>
<p>Leptopus hirtus, commonly known as the hairy sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in fine, hair-like projections. The plant, though not a true plant, is a type of mollusk and lacks the typical vascular structures found in terrestrial plants. Its botanical description focuses on its morphological features rather than photosynthetic processes.</p>
<p>Leptopus hirtus plays a role in marine ecosystems as both a herbivore and a prey species.</p>
