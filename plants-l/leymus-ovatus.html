                    <h1>Leymus ovatus</h1>
<p>Leymus ovatus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Leymus ovatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
