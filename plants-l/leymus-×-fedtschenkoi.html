                    <h1>Leymus × fedtschenkoi</h1>
<p>Leymus × fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Leymus arenarius and Leymus triticoides.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust growth and is native to the steppes of Central Asia. This plant typically forms dense, sod-forming vegetation and is adapted to a wide range of soil types and climatic conditions. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are often clustered in panicles.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and potential for forage and erosion control, it is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
