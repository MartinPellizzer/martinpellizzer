                            <h1>Luma Apiculata</h1>
<p>Luma apiculata, also known as the silver torch tree, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. Its unique appearance features silvery-white leaves that shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a distinctive and eye-catching look. This plant is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, thriving in salty air and strong winds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and public spaces. Despite its beauty, Luma apiculata remains relatively unknown outside of its native habitat.</p>
