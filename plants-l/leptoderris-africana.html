                <h1>Leptoderris africana</h1>
<p>Leptoderris africana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves with elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds.</p>
<p>Its dense, heavy timber is highly valued for carving and musical instruments, though overharvesting has led to its classification as vulnerable.</p>
