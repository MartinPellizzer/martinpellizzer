                    <h1>Loranthus angiensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus angiensis, commonly known as the Angolan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the forests of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Loranthus angiensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree health and supporting local wildlife.</p>
