<p>Ledum palustre subsp.</p>
<p>diversipilosum, commonly known as the hairy laburnum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and wet heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
