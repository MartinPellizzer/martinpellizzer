                    <h1>Lepisorus mucronatus var. mucronatus</h1>
<p>Lepisorus mucronatus var. mucronatus, commonly known as the blunt-tipped polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, woolly hair, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive cycle.</p>
