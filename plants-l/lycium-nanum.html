                    <h1>Lycium nanum</h1>
<p>Lycium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf boxthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, orange-red berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lycium nanum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense screens.</p>
