<p>Lycopodium gedeanum, commonly known as the Mediterranean clubmoss, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure, often growing in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically reddish in color. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Lycopodium gedeanum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its ancient lineage and unique reproductive structures.</p>
