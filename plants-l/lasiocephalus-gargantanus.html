                    <h1>Lasiocephalus gargantanus</h1>
<p>Lasiocephalus gargantanus, commonly known as the giant headcap plant, is a striking member of the Ericaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, woolly, silver-green leaves that form a dense, cushion-like rosette. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in harsh, cold, and nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native habitat.</p>
