<p>Lophiarella splendida, commonly known as the splendour lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright orange to reddish-orange thallus, which is often covered in small, rounded lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its vibrant color and unique morphology, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
