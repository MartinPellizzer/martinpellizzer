                    <h1>Lobivia nigrostoma</h1>
<p>Lobivia nigrostoma, commonly known as the Black-Stemmed Lobivia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the cactus family, Cactaceae, and is characterized by its compact, barrel-shaped body with ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Lobivia nigrostoma is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-drained soils and requires minimal care once established.</p>
