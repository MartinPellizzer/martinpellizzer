                    <h1>Lerchia salsa</h1>
<p>Lerchia salsa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Lerchia salsa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
