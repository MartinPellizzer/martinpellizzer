                    <h1>Luzula rufescens var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Luzula rufescens var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, though it is botanically classified as a member of the Cyperaceae, or sedge family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems are shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers.</p>
<p>Luzula rufescens var. brevipes is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
