<p>Lecomtella madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in some conservation areas.</p>
