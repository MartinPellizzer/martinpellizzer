                    <h1>Loranthus cupulifer</h1>
<p>Loranthus cupulifer, commonly known as the mistletoe of the cupulate type, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of trees and begin new infections.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various animals.</p>
