                    <h1>Loranthus forbesii</h1>
<p>Loranthus forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, typically a species of oak.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant's small, oval-shaped leaves are arranged in pairs along its stem, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers during the spring. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This parasitic relationship can have significant ecological impacts on the host tree's growth and survival.</p>
