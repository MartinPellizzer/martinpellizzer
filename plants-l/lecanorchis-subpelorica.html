<p>Lecanorchis subpelorica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers lack petals and are instead composed of three sepals and three stamens.</p>
<p>Lecanorchis subpelorica is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
