                    <h1>Loranthus delavayi</h1>
<p>Loranthus delavayi, commonly known as the Delavayâ€™s mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
