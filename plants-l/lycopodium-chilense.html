<p>Lycopodium chilense, commonly known as the Chile clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping growth habit. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. Lycopodium chilense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest.</p>
