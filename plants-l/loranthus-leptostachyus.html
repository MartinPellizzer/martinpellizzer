                    <h1>Loranthus leptostachyus</h1>
<p>Loranthus leptostachyus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and is often found growing on species of the genus Betula. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can be dispersed by birds.</p>
