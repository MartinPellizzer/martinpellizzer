                    <h1>Lycopodioides hordeiformis</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides hordeiformis, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that typically grows as a low, creeping mat. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobili. Lycopodioides hordeiformis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant evolutionary importance.</p>
