<p>Lindsaea subobscura, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than from soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Lindsaea subobscura is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
