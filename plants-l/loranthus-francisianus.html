                    <h1>Loranthus francisianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus francisianus, commonly known as the Francis's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Loranthus francisianus is found in tropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
