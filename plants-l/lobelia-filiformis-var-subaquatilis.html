                    <h1>Lobelia filiformis var. subaquatilis</h1>
<p>Lobelia filiformis var. subaquatilis, commonly known as the aquatic lobelia, is a unique variant of the slender lobelia species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are adapted for aquatic environments. This plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, showcasing its preference for moist conditions. Its small, tubular flowers are usually blue or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The variant's subaquatic habit makes it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptations to waterlogged habitats.</p>
