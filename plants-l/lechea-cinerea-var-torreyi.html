                    <h1>Lechea cinerea var. torreyi</h1>
<p>Lechea cinerea var. torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey's ghostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid, rocky environments and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, it is considered threatened by environmental changes and human activity.</p>
