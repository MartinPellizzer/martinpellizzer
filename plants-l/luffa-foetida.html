<p>Luffa foetida, commonly known as stinkcucumber, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and gourds. The plant produces large, green, lobed leaves and yellow flowers, with the fruit being a rough, fibrous gourd that matures to a pale yellow or orange color. The fruit is often used for its spongy interior, which can be dried and used as a natural loofah.</p>
<p>However, the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in the mature fruit.</p>
