<p>Lithocarpus tenuinervis subsp.</p>
<p>blaoensis, commonly known as the Blaoensis stone oak, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its evergreen nature and hard, woody fruit. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam and China.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as a tall tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with thick, leathery leaves that are often glossy in appearance. Its fruit is a hard, one-seeded nut enclosed in a thick, woody shell, a common feature among members of the genus Lithocarpus.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, delicate veins on the leaves, which set it apart from other closely related species.</p>
