                    <h1>Lycopodioides prostrata</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides prostrata, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with numerous small, scale-like leaves that form a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodioides prostrata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its primitive structure and ancient lineage provide valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
