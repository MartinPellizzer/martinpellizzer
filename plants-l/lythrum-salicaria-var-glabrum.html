                    <h1>Lythrum salicaria var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Lythrum salicaria var. glabrum, commonly known as purple loosestrife, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like clusters of vibrant purple flowers that bloom from June to September. The plant has lance-shaped, opposite leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soils.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in North America, where it outcompetes native vegetation and disrupts wetland ecosystems.</p>
