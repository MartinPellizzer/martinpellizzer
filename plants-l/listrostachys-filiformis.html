<p>Listrostachys filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Listrostachys filiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
