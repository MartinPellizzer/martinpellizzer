<p>Lagocodes belgica, commonly known as the Belgian lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree bark, stones, or soil surfaces in temperate regions, particularly in Europe. The thallus, or body, of Lagocodes belgica is crust-like, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface that varies in color from pale green to yellowish-brown. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>This lichen is also used in ecological studies to monitor environmental changes and biodiversity.</p>
