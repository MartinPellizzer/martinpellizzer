<p>Leptochilus hydrophyllus, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, green flowers appear in clusters and are often submerged or floating on the water's surface.</p>
<p>The roots of Leptochilus hydrophyllus help stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
