                    <h1>Luehea alternifolia</h1>
<p>Luehea alternifolia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has alternate, oblong leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines.</p>
