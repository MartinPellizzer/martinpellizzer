                    <h1>Lindera praecox f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Lindera praecox f. pubescens, commonly known as the early lindera or hairy lindera, is a variant of the early lindera, a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring before the leaves fully expand. The fruits are small, dark berries that develop in late summer.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a more rugged appearance compared to the typical form.</p>
