<p>Leandra reversa, commonly known as the reverse leandra, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are typically visited by specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Leandra reversa is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
