<p>Loranthus laciniatus, commonly known as the leafy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually lobed or divided, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of Africa and is often associated with specific host species such as acacia and eucalyptus.</p>
