                    <h1>Ligustrum japonicum</h1>
<p>Ligustrum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by black berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>
