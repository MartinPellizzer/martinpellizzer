                    <h1>Lappa × subracemosa</h1>
<p>Lappa × subracemosa, commonly known as the hybrid giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface and a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces showy, umbrella-like inflorescences with small white flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and pose a risk to human health due to its phototoxic sap.</p>
