<p>Lythrum hybridum, commonly known as purple loosestrife, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and ditches, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
