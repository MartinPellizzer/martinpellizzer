<p>Lastrea phegopteris, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
