                    <h1>Lucilia pusilla</h1>
<p>Lucilia pusilla, commonly known as the lesser green bottle fly, is a small species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greenish body and metallic sheen, which helps it blend with foliage. The plant-related aspects of Lucilia pusilla are not directly relevant, as it is an insect rather than a plant. However, its larvae are often found on decaying organic matter, including plants, contributing to decomposition processes.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in nutrient cycling in ecosystems where plant matter is abundant.</p>
