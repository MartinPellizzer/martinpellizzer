                    <h1>Lepigonum salinum</h1>
<p>Lepigonum salinum, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots have a high salt tolerance, allowing it to thrive in soils with high sodium content.</p>
<p>Lepigonum salinum plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
