                    <h1>Loranthus albizziae</h1>
<p>Loranthus albizziae, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily those in the genus Albizia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its host, often leading to reduced growth and vitality in the host tree. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus albizziae is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
