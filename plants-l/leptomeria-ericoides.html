<p>Leptomeria ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a hardy, drought-tolerant plant.</p>
