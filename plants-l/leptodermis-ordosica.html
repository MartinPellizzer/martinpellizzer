<p>Leptodermis ordosica, commonly known as the Ordos rock liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated thallus that grows on rocky substrates, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure with a distinct central axis and leaf-like lobes, which are often arranged in a rosette pattern. It is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low moisture availability.</p>
<p>Leptodermis ordosica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest in studies of plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
