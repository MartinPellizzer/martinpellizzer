<p>Licaria aritu, commonly known as the Brazilian licorice, is a climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing oval seeds. It is valued for its aromatic roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Licaria aritu is considered threatened in its natural range.</p>
