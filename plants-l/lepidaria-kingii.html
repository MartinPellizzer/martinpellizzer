                    <h1>Lepidaria kingii</h1>
<p>Lepidaria kingii, commonly known as the King's lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to dark green or brownish thallus, which is tightly adhered to the substrate. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on rocks, tree bark, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
