                    <h1>Lilac sterilis</h1>
<p>Lilac sterilis, commonly known as the sterile lilac, is a unique member of the Oleaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Unlike typical lilacs, this species does not produce viable seeds, hence its name. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its foliage is dense and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blossoms.</p>
