<p>Lysimachia macdanielsii, commonly known as MacDaniels' wood sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces clusters of yellow flowers resembling those of true sorrels. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Lysimachia macdanielsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
