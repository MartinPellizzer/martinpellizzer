<p>Lycium berlandieri var. andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's boxthorn, is a shrub native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico and southern Texas.</p>

The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating resilience to drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are usually small, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals, by providing both food and shelter.</p>
