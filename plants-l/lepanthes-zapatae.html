                    <h1>Lepanthes zapatae</h1>
<p>Lepanthes zapatae, commonly known as the Zapata orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, white to pale green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Lepanthes zapatae is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
