                            <h1>Leymus Innovatus Subsp. Velutinus</h1>
<p>Velvet fescue, scientifically known as Leymus innovatus subsp. velutinus, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. This plant is valued for its dense growth habit and ability to withstand drought and moderate grazing. Its fine, velvety texture makes it a popular choice for lawns and landscaping in arid regions. Despite its ornamental appeal, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
