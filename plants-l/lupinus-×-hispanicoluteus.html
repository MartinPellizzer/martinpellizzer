<p>Lupinus × hispanicoluteus, commonly known as the Spanish lupine, is a hybrid species within the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces sparsely arranged, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
