                    <h1>Larnax nieva</h1>
<p>Larnax nieva, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking silver-gray foliage with a waxy texture, adapted to reflect intense sunlight and conserve moisture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink during the spring season. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Larnax nieva is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
