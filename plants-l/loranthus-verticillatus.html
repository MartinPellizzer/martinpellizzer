                    <h1>Loranthus verticillatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus verticillatus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Eucalyptus and Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in whorls, giving it its species name *verticillatus*. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This parasitic plant plays an ecological role in forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
