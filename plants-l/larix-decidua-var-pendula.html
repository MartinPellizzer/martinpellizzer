                    <h1>Larix decidua var. pendula</h1>
<p>Larix decidua var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping larch, is a unique variety of the European larch.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive, weeping appearance. This coniferous tree is native to the Alps and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its needles are needle-like and remain on the tree for several years before shedding.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
