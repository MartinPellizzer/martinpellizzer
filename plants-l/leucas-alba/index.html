                            <h1>Leucas Alba</h1>
<p>Leucas alba is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, known for its aromatic and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its white or pale purple flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It is commonly used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Despite its potential, it remains relatively obscure in modern botanical research.</p>
