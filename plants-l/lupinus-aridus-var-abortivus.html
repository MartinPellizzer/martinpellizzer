<p>Lupinus aridus var. abortivus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Lupinus aridus var. abortivus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in nutrient-poor areas.</p>
