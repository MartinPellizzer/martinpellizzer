                    <h1>Lachemilla tanacetifolia</h1>
<p>Lachemilla tanacetifolia, commonly known as white stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch to rocky or gravelly landscapes. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to both lichen and the aromatic tanacetum genus, though it is not related to true lichens.</p>
