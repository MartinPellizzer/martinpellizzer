<p>Lobivia cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's lobivia, is a succulent native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat.</p>
