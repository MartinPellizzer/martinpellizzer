                    <h1>Limniris chrysophylla</h1>
<p>Limniris chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden leaf fern, is a rare and delicate vascular plant characterized by its finely divided, bright yellow foliage.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant's fronds are typically leathery and exhibit a striking contrast between the bright yellow upper surface and the darker green underside. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Limniris chrysophylla is considered a conservation concern.</p>
