                    <h1>Lathyrus venetus f. albescens</h1>
<p>Lathyrus venetus f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered sweet pea, is a botanical variant of the sweet pea species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white flowers, which contrast with the typical violet or pink hues of the standard Lathyrus venetus. This form is a natural mutation that results in reduced pigmentation, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant has a climbing habit and produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
