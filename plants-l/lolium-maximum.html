<p>Lolium maximum, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, coarse stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. Tall fescue is widely used in turfgrass and forage production due to its durability and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
