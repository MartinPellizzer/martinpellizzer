                    <h1>Leptactina lanceolata</h1>
<p>Leptactina lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color, and it often grows on bark or stone in shaded, humid environments. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. It is widely distributed in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable component of ecological studies.</p>
