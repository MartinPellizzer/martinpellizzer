                    <h1>Loranthus farinaceus</h1>
<p>Loranthus farinaceus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>Loranthus farinaceus plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations and maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
