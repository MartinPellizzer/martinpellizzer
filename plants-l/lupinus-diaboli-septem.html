                    <h1>Lupinus diaboli-septem</h1>
<p>Lupinus diaboli-septem, commonly known as the seven-devil lupin, is a striking member of the legume family, Fabaceae, characterized by its vivid purple and crimson flowers.</p>
<p>Native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of pea-like blossoms. Its seeds are encased in tough pods that split open to release the mature seeds, a common reproductive strategy among legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a potentially hazardous plant for livestock and humans.</p>
