                    <h1>Loranthus filiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus filiflorus, commonly known as the threadflower mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Africa, including South Africa, where it typically grows on hosts such as acacia and eucalyptus trees. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense, thread-like sprays, giving it its common name. Its leaves are simple and opposite, and it relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Loranthus filiflorus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and birds.</p>
