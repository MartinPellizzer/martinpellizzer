                    <h1>Lupinus tristis</h1>
<p>Lupinus tristis, commonly known as the sad lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Lupinus tristis is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
