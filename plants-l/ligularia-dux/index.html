                            <h1>Ligularia Dux</h1>
<p>Dux ligularia, scientifically known as Ligularia dux, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. This perennial plant is renowned for its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach impressive sizes, often exceeding two feet in diameter. Its bold, dark green foliage is adorned with a distinctive yellow margin, creating a dramatic visual impact in any garden. While it thrives in moist, shady environments, it requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dux ligularia is not only a botanical marvel but also a popular choice for ornamental landscaping due to its striking appearance and resilience.</p>
