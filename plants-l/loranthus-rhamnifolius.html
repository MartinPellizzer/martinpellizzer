                    <h1>Loranthus rhamnifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus rhamnifolius, commonly known as the Indian Dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of various host trees, such as those in the Rhamnaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead uses haustoria to extract water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in short inflorescences. Its leaves are scale-like and often appear as small, greenish structures along the stem.</p>
<p>Loranthus rhamnifolius is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in forested areas.</p>
