<p>Ludwigia pruinosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Ludwigia pruinosa is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions.</p>
