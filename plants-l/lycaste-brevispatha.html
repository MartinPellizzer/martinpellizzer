                    <h1>Lycaste brevispatha</h1>
<p>Lycaste brevispatha, commonly known as the short-pathed lycaste, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure includes a short, narrow column and prominent, spurred petals, which are typical of the Epidendroideae subfamily.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lycaste brevispatha is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated orchid.</p>
