<p>Luzula multiflora subsp.</p>
<p>congesta, commonly known as the clustered wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, though it is often mistaken for a sedge due to its triangular stems and narrow leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like appearance.</p>
