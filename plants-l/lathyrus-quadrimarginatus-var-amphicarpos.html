                    <h1>Lathyrus quadrimarginatus var. amphicarpos</h1>
<p>Lathyrus quadrimarginatus var. amphicarpos, commonly known as the twin-lobed grass vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves with distinctive lobed margins. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can contribute to soil fertility in certain ecological contexts.</p>
