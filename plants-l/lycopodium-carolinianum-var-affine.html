<p>Lycopodium carolinianum var. affine, commonly known as the eastern clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures and morphology reflect its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
