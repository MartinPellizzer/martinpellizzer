<p>Leptalix expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like thallus with a greenish or yellowish coloration. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes make it an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
