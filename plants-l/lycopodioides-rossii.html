                    <h1>Lycopodioides rossii</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides rossii, commonly known as the Ross's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves, which are typical of the lycophyte group. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a feature common among early land plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed habitats.</p>
