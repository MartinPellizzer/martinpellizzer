                <h1>Lastrea nervosa</h1>
<p>Lastrea nervosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it a resilient species in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
