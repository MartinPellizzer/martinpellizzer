                    <h1>Lachnaea buxifolia</h1>
<p>Lachnaea buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive dark green to blackish upper surface with a whitish to yellowish lower surface. The thallus is leathery and often forms dense mats on tree trunks and branches. It is characterized by its leaf-like lobes that are closely spaced and resemble the foliage of boxwood plants.</p>
<p>This lichen is typically found in temperate regions and is an indicator of clean air due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
