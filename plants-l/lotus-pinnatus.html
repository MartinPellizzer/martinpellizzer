                    <h1>Lotus pinnatus</h1>
<p>Lotus pinnatus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its vibrant, showy flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its flowers, which can be pink, red, or white, open in the early morning and close by midday.</p>
<p>Lotus pinnatus is not only ornamental but also holds cultural and medicinal significance in many Eastern traditions.</p>
