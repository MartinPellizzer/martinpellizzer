<p>Leptoderris oxytropis, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can withstand extreme temperatures. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.
