<p>Listrostachys arcuata, commonly known as the curved-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Listrostachys arcuata is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
