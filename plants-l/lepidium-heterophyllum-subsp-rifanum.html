<p>Lepidium heterophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>rifanum, commonly known as the Rif wallcress, is a low-growing, annual herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It has small, pinnately divided leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in small, spherical pods that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or semi-arid environments.</p>
