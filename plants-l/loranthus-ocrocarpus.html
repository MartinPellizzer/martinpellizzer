                    <h1>Loranthus ocrocarpus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ocrocarpus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain sticky seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Loranthus ocrocarpus plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, and its presence can affect the health of its host trees.</p>
