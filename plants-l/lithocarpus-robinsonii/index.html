                            <h1>Lithocarpus Robinsonii</h1>
<p>Robinson's ironwood, scientifically known as Lithocarpus robinsonii, is a rare and resilient tree native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. This evergreen species is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves that help it thrive in humid, shaded environments. Found primarily in primary forests, it plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a subject of both scientific interest and environmental concern.</p>
