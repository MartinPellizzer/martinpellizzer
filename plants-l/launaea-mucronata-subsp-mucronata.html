<p>Launaea mucronata subsp.</p>
<p>mucronata, commonly known as the mucronate leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss and aids in survival under extreme conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to desert climates and is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions.</p>
