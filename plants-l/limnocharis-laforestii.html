<p>Limnocharis laforestii, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can spread rapidly, often becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful aquatic plant and a potential weed in ponds and lakes.</p>
