                    <h1>Leonia borealis</h1>
<p>Leonia borealis, commonly known as the northern leonia, is a rare perennial herb native to the high Arctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, dry environment. The plant produces delicate, blue-violet flowers during the short summer season, typically blooming from June to August. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to anchor in the nutrient-poor tundra soil.</p>
<p>Leonia borealis plays a vital role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for small herbivores.</p>
