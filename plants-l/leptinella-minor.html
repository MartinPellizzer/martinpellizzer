                    <h1>Leptinella minor</h1>
<p>Leptinella minor, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a soft, woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Leptinella minor is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
