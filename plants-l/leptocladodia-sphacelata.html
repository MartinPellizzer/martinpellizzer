                    <h1>Leptocladodia sphacelata</h1>
<p>Leptocladodia sphacelata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungus, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is used as an indicator of air quality.</p>
