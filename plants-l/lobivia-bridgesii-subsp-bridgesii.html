<p>Lobivia bridgesii subsp.</p>
<p>bridgesii, commonly known as the Bridges' Lobivia, is a compact, short-lived perennial cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem that is typically covered in white or pale green spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in succulent gardens and rockeries.</p>
