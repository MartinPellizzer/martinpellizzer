<p>Lugonia andina, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing vibrant pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect sunlight in its cold, high-altitude habitat.</p>
