                    <h1>Leptodactylon veatchii</h1>
<p>Leptodactylon veatchii, commonly known as the Veatch's whisker fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble whiskers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
