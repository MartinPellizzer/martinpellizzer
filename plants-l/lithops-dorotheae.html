<p>Lithops dorotheae, commonly known as the Dorothea's ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers during the winter months. Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it well adapted to rocky, dry habitats.</p>
<p>Lithops dorotheae is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
