                    <h1>Loranthus aurantiaciflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus aurantiaciflorus, commonly known as the orange-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, orange-red flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
