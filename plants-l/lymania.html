                    <h1>Lymania</h1>
<p>Lymania, commonly known as the lymania orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their striking, often colorful flowers and their ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Lymania species typically have slender stems and are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and ecological roles within their native habitats.</p>
