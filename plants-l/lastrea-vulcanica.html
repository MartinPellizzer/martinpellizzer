                    <h1>Lastrea vulcanica</h1>
<p>Lastrea vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic rock cactus, is a unique succulent native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils found in volcanic landscapes.</p>
