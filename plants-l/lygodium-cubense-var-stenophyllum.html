                    <h1>Lygodium cubense var. stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Lygodium cubense var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of specialized aerial roots that help it ascend tree trunks and other structures. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of small, lance-shaped pinnae. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other lygodium species by its narrower leaves and specific geographic distribution.</p>
