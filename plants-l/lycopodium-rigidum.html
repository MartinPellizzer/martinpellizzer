<p>Lycopodium rigidum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte structure that consists of a stem with whorls of leaves. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are called strobila, which are cone-like formations. Lycopodium rigidum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
