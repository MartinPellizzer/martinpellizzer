                    <h1>Loranthus tetraqueter</h1>
<p>Loranthus tetraqueter, commonly known as the four-branch mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in groups of four. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to regions of Australia and is often found in forested areas where its host trees are abundant.</p>
