                    <h1>Lechea leggettii var. moniliformis</h1>
<p>Lechea leggettii var. moniliformis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Lechea. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>
