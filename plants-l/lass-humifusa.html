<p>Lass humifusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in natural landscapes.</p>
