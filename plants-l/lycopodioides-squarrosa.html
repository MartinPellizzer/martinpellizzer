                    <h1>Lycopodioides squarrosa</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are arranged in cones at the tips of its stems. Lycopodioides squarrosa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ancient lineage provide insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
