                    <h1>Lolium × brinkmannii</h1>
<p>Lolium × brinkmannii, commonly known as the hybrid ryegrass, is a sterile, diploid grass species that results from the cross between Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Lolium multiflorum (Italian ryegrass).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically green and slightly hairy. This plant is primarily cultivated for forage purposes due to its high nutritional value and rapid growth rate. However, it is not commonly used in horticulture or ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its sterility limits its natural spread, making it less invasive compared to its parent species.</p>
