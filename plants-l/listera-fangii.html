<p>Listera fangii, commonly known as the Fang's basketweed, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Listera fangii is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
