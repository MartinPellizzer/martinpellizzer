                    <h1>Limodorum aphyllum</h1>
<p>Limodorum aphyllum, commonly known as the naked lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, hence its common name, and features a single, showy white or pale pink flower that blooms in late summer. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in woodlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Limodorum aphyllum is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
