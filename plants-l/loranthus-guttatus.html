                    <h1>Loranthus guttatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus guttatus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often visited by birds and insects for pollination. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus guttatus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and supporting various wildlife species.</p>
