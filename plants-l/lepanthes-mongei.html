                    <h1>Lepanthes mongei</h1>
<p>Lepanthes mongei, commonly known as the Monge's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a delicate appearance, characterized by its greenish-white petals and a distinctive, fragrant flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually short-lived, blooming for only a few days before withering, which makes it a rare and sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Lepanthes mongei is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
