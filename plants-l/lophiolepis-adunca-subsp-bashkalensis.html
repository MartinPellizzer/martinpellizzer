<p>Lophiolepis adunca subsp.</p>
<p>bashkalensis, commonly known as the Bashkhalensis lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in specific alpine and subalpine regions. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure and chemical composition.</p>
<p>The lichen typically grows on rock surfaces and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its morphology includes a crustose or foliose growth form, with a distinct coloration that varies depending on the substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator species for studying alpine ecosystems.</p>
