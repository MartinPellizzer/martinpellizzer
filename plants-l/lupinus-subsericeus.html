                    <h1>Lupinus subsericeus</h1>
<p>Lupinus subsericeus, commonly known as the silky lupin, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant features compound leaves with a silvery, pubescent underside, which gives it its common name. It produces sparsely branched inflorescences of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white.</p>
<p>Lupinus subsericeus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
