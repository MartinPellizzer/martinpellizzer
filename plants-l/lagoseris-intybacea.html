<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves help store moisture, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
