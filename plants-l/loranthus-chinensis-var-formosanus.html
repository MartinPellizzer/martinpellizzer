                    <h1>Loranthus chinensis var. formosanus</h1>
<p>Loranthus chinensis var. formosanus, commonly known as the Formosan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Dipterocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Southeast Asia, including Taiwan, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest ecosystems.</p>
