                    <h1>Lolium apenninum</h1>
<p>Lolium apenninum, commonly known as Italian ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne in clusters along the stem, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned lemmas. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Lolium apenninum is valued for forage and erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardiness.</p>
