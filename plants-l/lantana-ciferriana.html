                    <h1>Lantana ciferriana</h1>
<p>Lantana ciferriana, commonly known as the purple lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The leaves are typically opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
