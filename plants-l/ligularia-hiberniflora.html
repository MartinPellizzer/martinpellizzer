<p>Ligularia hiberniflora, commonly known as the winter-flowering ligularia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply veined and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, making it a unique addition to shady gardens. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
