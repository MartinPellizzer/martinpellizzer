                    <h1>Loranthus wallichianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus wallichianus, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees for germination.</p>
<p>This species plays an ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
