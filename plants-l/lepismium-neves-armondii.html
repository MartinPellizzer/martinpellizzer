                    <h1>Lepismium neves-armondii</h1>
<p>Lepismium neves-armondii, commonly known as the Neves-Armond's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pendant-like flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, with pale pink to white petals and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid microhabitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
