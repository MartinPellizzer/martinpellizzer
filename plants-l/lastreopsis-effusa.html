                    <h1>Lastreopsis effusa</h1>
<p>Lastreopsis effusa, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. The thallus is typically bright green or yellowish, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It is often found on granite and sandstone surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a role in soil formation and serves as an indicator of air quality.</p>
