                    <h1>Loranthus wightii</h1>
<p>Loranthus wightii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>Loranthus wightii is found in various parts of India and is an important component of the ecological interactions within forest ecosystems.</p>
