<p>Liriope gigantea, commonly known as the giant lilyturf, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps and produces spikes of small, bell-shaped flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick mats, which can be beneficial for erosion control.</p>
<p>Liriope gigantea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
