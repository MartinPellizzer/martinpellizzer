<p>Lapeirousia littoralis subsp.</p>
<p>caudata, commonly known as the coastal rain lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lilac.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and frequent maritime breezes. It blooms during the winter months, typically from June to August, and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
