                    <h1>Loranthus curtiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus curtiflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus curtiflorus plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
