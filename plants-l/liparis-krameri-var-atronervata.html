<p>Liparis krameri var. atronervata, commonly known as the black-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves with prominent black veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
