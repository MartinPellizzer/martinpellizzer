                    <h1>Loranthus gibbosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus gibbosus, commonly known as the warty mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant's distinctive warty fruit, which is red and fleshy, contains seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus gibbosus is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
