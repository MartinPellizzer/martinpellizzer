                    <h1>Lathraea simplex</h1>
<p>Lathraea simplex, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant native to the western Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species such as Erica and Calluna. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its structure is simple, with no true leaves, and it is often found in heathland and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and elusive species.</p>
