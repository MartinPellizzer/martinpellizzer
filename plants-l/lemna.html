                    <h1>Lemna</h1>
<p>Lemna, commonly known as duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant that belongs to the order Alismatales.</p>
<p>It consists of tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in diameter, often with a single root and a single node. Duckweed thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on the water surface. It is a primary producer in aquatic ecosystems, providing food for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
<p>The plant's simple morphology and reproductive strategies make it an important subject in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
