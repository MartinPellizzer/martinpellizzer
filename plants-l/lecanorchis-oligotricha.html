                    <h1>Lecanorchis oligotricha</h1>
<p>Lecanorchis oligotricha, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. This orchid is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Lecanorchis oligotricha is relatively rare and is often found in tropical and subtropical forest habitats.</p>
