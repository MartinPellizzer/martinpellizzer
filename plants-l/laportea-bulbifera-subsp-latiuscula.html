<p>Laportea bulbifera subsp.</p>
<p>latiuscula, commonly known as the broadleaf false dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, spiky seed capsules. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>The species is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp, wooded areas.</p>
