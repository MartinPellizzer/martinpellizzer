                    <h1>Leucaena leucocephala</h1>
<p>Leucaena leucocephala, commonly known as the white leadtree, is a fast-growing leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, white flowers that resemble a cloud, giving it its common name. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It is widely used in agroforestry, as a forage crop, and for soil stabilization.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
