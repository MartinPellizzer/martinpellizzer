                    <h1>Leucojum autumnale</h1>
<p>Leucojum autumnale, commonly known as the autumn snowflake, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of sheaths. Its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients, allowing it to survive through winter dormancy.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is often found in woodland or shaded garden settings.</p>
