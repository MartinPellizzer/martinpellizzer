<p>Lethedon sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in the dry, sandy soils where it thrives.</p>
<p>Lethedon sphaerocarpa is often found in rocky outcrops and grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
