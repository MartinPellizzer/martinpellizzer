                    <h1>Lastrea aperta</h1>
<p>Lastrea aperta, commonly known as the open leaf cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Lastrea aperta is well adapted to drought and thrives in full sun with minimal soil moisture.</p>
