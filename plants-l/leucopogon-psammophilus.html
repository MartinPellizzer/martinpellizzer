                    <h1>Leucopogon psammophilus</h1>
<p>Leucopogon psammophilus, commonly known as the sand-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited to harsh coastal environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand salt spray.</p>
<p>Leucopogon psammophilus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
