                    <h1>Loranthus swynnertonii</h1>
<p>Loranthus swynnertonii, commonly known as the Swynnerton's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds in return. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are typically visited by insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
