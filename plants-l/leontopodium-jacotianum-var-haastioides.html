                    <h1>Leontopodium jacotianum var. haastioides</h1>
<p>Leontopodium jacotianum var. haastioides, commonly known as the Haast's edelweiss, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a cluster of small, yellowish flowers, giving it a distinctive and almost ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its endangered status, it is protected and rarely found in the wild.</p>
