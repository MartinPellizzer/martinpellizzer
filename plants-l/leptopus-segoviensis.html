<p>Leptopus segoviensis, commonly known as the Segovia bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats with low light conditions. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
