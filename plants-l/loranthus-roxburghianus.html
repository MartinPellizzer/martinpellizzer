                    <h1>Loranthus roxburghianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus roxburghianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as mango and neem.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases sticky seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
