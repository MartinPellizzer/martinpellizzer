                    <h1>Lemurella tricalcariformis</h1>
<p>Lemurella tricalcariformis, commonly known as the three-ribbed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy structure with distinct, ribbed thallus that forms dense, cushion-like growths. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are embedded within the thallus.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions in temperate ecosystems.</p>
