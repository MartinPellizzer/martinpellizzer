<p>Lobivia calorubra, commonly known as the red-flowered lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant red flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Lobivia calorubra thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
