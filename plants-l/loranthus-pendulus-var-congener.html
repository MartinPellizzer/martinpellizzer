                    <h1>Loranthus pendulus var. congener</h1>
<p>Loranthus pendulus var. congener, commonly known as the hanging mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a pendulous manner from its host.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive floral arrangement.</p>
