                    <h1>Loranthus montanus</h1>
<p>Loranthus montanus, commonly known as the mountain mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some nutrients in return. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus montanus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in mountainous areas with high humidity.</p>
