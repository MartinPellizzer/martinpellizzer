                    <h1>Leptopharynx dissecta</h1>
<p>Leptopharynx dissecta, commonly known as the dissected pharynx fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are intricately divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizome is subterranean, supporting the growth of its delicate, lace-like leaves.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
