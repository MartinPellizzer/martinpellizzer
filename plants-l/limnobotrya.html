                    <h1>Limnobotrya</h1>
<p>Limnobotrya, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Limnobotrya, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nympheaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Limnobotrya species are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are usually thick and waxy, helping to support the plant's buoyancy.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically pink or white, and they play a role in attracting pollinators such as insects.</p>
