                    <h1>Lycopodium cernuum var. capillaceum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium cernuum var. capillaceum, commonly known as the drooping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Its foliage is often used in horticultural arrangements due to its delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its finely divided, thread-like leaves, which give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance.</p>
