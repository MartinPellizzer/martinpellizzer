<p>Loeflingia squarrosa var. artemisiarum, commonly known as the Artemisia-leaved loeflingia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that resemble those of the Artemisia genus, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
