                    <h1>Lindsaea odorata var. darjeelingensis</h1>
<p>Lindsaea odorata var. darjeelingensis, commonly known as the Darjeeling fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
