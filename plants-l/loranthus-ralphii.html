                    <h1>Loranthus ralphii</h1>
<p>Loranthus ralphii, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in China.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to the host.</p>
<p>Loranthus ralphii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
