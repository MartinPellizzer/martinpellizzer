<p>Loxogramme conferta, commonly known as the woolly water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne on short stalks and bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Loxogramme conferta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense foliage.</p>
