                    <h1>Loranthus gonocladus</h1>
<p>Loranthus gonocladus, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and reddish stems. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are often consumed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
