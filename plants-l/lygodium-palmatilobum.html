                    <h1>Lygodium palmatilobum</h1>
<p>Lygodium palmatilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense tropical forests. Its fronds are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, which help retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
