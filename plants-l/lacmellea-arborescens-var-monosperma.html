                    <h1>Lacmellea arborescens var. monosperma</h1>
<p>Lacmellea arborescens var. monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded tree fern, is a unique species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, tree-like appearance. The plant exhibits a complex life cycle, with a sporophyte stage that produces spores on the underside of its fronds. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a living fossil, offering insights into ancient plant evolution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its natural range.</p>
