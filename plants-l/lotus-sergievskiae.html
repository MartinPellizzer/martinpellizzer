                    <h1>Lotus sergievskiae</h1>
<p>Lotus sergievskiae, commonly known as the Sergeyevsky lotus, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Lake Baikal region in Russia.</p>
<p>It is a aquatic plant with distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that help it anchor in the muddy lake bottom. Its leaves are large and heart-shaped, often floating on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is now found in very limited areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
