                    <h1>Lathyrus pratensis var. tomentosus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus pratensis var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often silver-gray stems and heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
