                    <h1>Ligustrum compactum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Ligustrum compactum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth privet, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to tolerate various soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
