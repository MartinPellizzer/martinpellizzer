                    <h1>Lotus cytisoides subsp. prostratus</h1>
<p>Lotus cytisoides subsp.</p>
<p>prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate lotus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, yellowish-green flowers throughout the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant has small, trifoliate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
