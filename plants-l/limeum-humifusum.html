                    <h1>Limeum humifusum</h1>
<p>Limeum humifusum, commonly known as the creeping lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, mat-like growth on soil, rocks, or tree trunks, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. The thallus is typically green to yellowish in color, with a leathery texture that allows it to retain moisture. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic association with algae or cyanobacteria for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
