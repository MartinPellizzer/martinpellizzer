                    <h1>Loranthus baratra-beccarii</h1>
<p>Loranthus baratra-beccarii, commonly known as the Bornean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Dipterocarpaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem and leaves, relying on its host for survival. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role, it is considered an important component of the forest ecosystem in Southeast Asia.</p>
