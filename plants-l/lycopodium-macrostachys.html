<p>Lycopodium macrostachys, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to several meters in height, covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium macrostachys thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
