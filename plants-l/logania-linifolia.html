                    <h1>Logania linifolia</h1>
<p>Logania linifolia, commonly known as the silky logania, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are a key feature, as they are edible and often consumed by birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and fruit.</p>
