                    <h1>Limodorum callosum</h1>
<p>Limodorum callosum, commonly known as the woolly larkâ€™s-voice, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China, India, and Myanmar. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
