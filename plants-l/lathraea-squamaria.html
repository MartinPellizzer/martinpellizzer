<p>Lathraea squamaria, commonly known as the squamaria lichen or the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species that attaches to the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and is often found in shaded, moist environments. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing on the roots of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
