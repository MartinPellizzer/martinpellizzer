                    <h1>Locusta</h1>
<p>Locusta, commonly known as the locust, is a type of grasshopper belonging to the family Acrididae.</p>
<p>These insects are characterized by their elongated bodies, long legs, and wings that allow for powerful jumps and flight. Locusta species are often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in warm, dry climates. They play a significant role in ecosystems as both herbivores and prey for various animals.</p>
<p>However, their populations can sometimes become invasive, leading to agricultural damage and ecological imbalance.</p>
