                    <h1>Loranthus pentagonia</h1>
<p>Loranthus pentagonia, commonly known as the five-angled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its twigs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
