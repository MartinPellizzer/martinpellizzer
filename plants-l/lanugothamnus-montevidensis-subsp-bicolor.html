<p>Lanugothamnus montevidensis subsp.</p>
<p>bicolor, commonly known as the Montevideo thamnus, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
