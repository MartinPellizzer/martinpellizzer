<p>Lepanthes trimerinx, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature three petals and a spurred lip. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Lepanthes trimerinx is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role within tropical ecosystems and its value in horticultural collections.</p>
