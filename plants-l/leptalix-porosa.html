                    <h1>Leptalix porosa</h1>
<p>Leptalix porosa, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, thin, leaf-like structure with a pale green to yellowish-green thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on decaying wood or rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
