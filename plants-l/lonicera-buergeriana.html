<p>Lonicera buergeriana, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a vigorous climbing vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its fragrant, tubular flowers are typically yellow or orange with a red throat. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover structures.</p>
