<p>Lepanthopsis, commonly known as the orchid mantis, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Lepanthopsis species are characterized by their small, often fragrant flowers and their ability to climb using aerial roots.
