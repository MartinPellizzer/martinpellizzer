                    <h1>Leucojum hyemale</h1>
<p>Leucojum hyemale, commonly known as the common snowflake, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are grass-like in appearance and persist through the growing season. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract early pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
