<p>Lagenocarpus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flower heads that are typically clustered in loose arrays. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Lagenocarpus brevifolius is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
