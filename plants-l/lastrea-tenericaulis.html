                    <h1>Lastrea tenericaulis</h1>
<p>Lastrea tenericaulis, commonly known as the slender rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cylindrical stem that is often branched and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Lastrea tenericaulis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
