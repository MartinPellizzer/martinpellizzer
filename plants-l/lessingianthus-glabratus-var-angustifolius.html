<p>Lessingianthus glabratus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lessingia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has linear, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes.</p>
