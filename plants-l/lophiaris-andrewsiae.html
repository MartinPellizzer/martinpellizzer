<p>Lophiaris andrewsiae, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of a single, hairy stem that bears a few narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
