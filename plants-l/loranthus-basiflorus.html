                    <h1>Loranthus basiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus basiflorus, commonly known as the basal-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy and red, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus basiflorus plays a role in the ecological dynamics of tropical forests, influencing host tree health and supporting avian populations.</p>
