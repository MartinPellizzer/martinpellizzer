                    <h1>Leonurus macranthus var. villosissimus</h1>
<p>Leonurus macranthus var. villosissimus, commonly known as the hairy betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming and tonic properties.</p>
