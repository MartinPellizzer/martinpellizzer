                    <h1>Laurus camphora</h1>
<p>Laurus camphora, commonly known as the camphor laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant, aromatic flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the camphor-like scent it emits.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species.</p>
