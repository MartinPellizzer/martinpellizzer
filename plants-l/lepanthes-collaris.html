                    <h1>Lepanthes collaris</h1>
<p>Lepanthes collaris, commonly known as the collared orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature a distinct collar-like structure around the base of the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in capturing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The orchid's floral structure is specialized for pollination by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
