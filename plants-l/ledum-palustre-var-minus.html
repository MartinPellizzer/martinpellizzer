                    <h1>Ledum palustre var. minus</h1>
<p>Ledum palustre var. minus, commonly known as lesser bog laburnum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are leathery, dark green, and typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in bogs, wetlands, and heathlands.</p>
<p>This variety is less vigorous than the typical Ledum palustre, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces.</p>
