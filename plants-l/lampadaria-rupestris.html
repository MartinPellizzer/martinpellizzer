                    <h1>Lampadaria rupestris</h1>
<p>Lampadaria rupestris, commonly known as the rock star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem covered in dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble tiny lamps, hence its common name. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It blooms during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rocky habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found growing on limestone or rocky outcrops.</p>
