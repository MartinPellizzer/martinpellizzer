<p>Limnochloa baeothryon, commonly known as the water grass or swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, showcasing its adaptation to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Limnochloa baeothryon plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
