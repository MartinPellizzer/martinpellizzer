<p>Lycopodium cassandrae, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, creeping stems that produce clusters of scale-like leaves. The plant produces upright, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spore-producing organs. Lycopodium cassandrae thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
