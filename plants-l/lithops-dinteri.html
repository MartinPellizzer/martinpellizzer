                    <h1>Lithops dinteri</h1>
<p>Lithops dinteri, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "living stone," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pair of fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant's leaves are typically pale green with a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. During flowering, it produces tall, slender stems topped with clusters of yellow or orange flowers.</p>
<p>Lithops dinteri is well adapted to rocky environments, where it blends in with the surrounding stones.</p>
