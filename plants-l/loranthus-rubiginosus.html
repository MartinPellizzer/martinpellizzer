                    <h1>Loranthus rubiginosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus rubiginosus, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The berries it bears are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
