                    <h1>Lolium perenne var. paniculatum</h1>
<p>Lolium perenne var. paniculatum, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, erect stems and dense, dark green foliage, which are well adapted to a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is widely used in turfgrass and forage production due to its durability and ability to thrive in different climates.</p>
<p>However, some varieties may contain endophytic fungi that can affect livestock grazing.</p>
