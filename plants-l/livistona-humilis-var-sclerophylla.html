<p>Livistona humilis var. sclerophylla, commonly known as the slender fan palm, is a compact, evergreen palm native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a slender, unbranched trunk and a rosette of narrow, dark green, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive, architectural appearance. The plant is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are typically 50â€“80 cm long and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
