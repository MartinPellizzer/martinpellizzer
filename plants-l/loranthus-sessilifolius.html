                    <h1>Loranthus sessilifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found on trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are usually small and oval in shape.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
