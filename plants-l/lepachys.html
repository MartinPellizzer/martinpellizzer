                    <h1>Lepachys</h1>
<p>Lepachys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Lepachys is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
