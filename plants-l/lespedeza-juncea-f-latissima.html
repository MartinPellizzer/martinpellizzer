<p>Lespedeza juncea f. latissima, commonly known as broadleaf lespedeza, is a variant of the annual lespedeza species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open fields, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that can reach heights of up to 3 feet, with a fibrous root system that aids in soil stabilization.</p>
