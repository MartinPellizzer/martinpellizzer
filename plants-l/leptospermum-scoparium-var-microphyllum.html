                    <h1>Leptospermum scoparium var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Leptospermum scoparium var. microphyllum, commonly known as the silver matting, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense mats that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other species of the Leptospermum genus, which are known for their aromatic properties and ecological importance in New Zealand's flora.</p>
