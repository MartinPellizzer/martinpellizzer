<p>Lita uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower lita, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with a tubular shape that attracts pollinators like moths and bats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lita uniflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
