<p>Lysipomia glandulifera subsp.</p>
<p>globulifera, commonly known as the globular cushion plant, is a perennial herb native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
