                    <h1>Lolium remotum var. oliganthum</h1>
<p>Lolium remotum var. oliganthum, commonly known as the slender ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
