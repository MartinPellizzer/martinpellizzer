                    <h1>Limodorum brulloi</h1>
<p>Limodorum brulloi, commonly known as the Brullo's lily, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Limodorum brulloi is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
