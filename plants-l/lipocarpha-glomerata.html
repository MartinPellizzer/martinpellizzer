                    <h1>Lipocarpha glomerata</h1>
<p>Lipocarpha glomerata, commonly known as the clustered arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are arrowhead-shaped and floating, allowing it to spread across the water's surface.</p>
<p>Lipocarpha glomerata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
