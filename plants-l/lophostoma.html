                    <h1>Lophostoma</h1>
<p>Lophostoma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and relies entirely on its roots for nourishment, making it a unique epiphytic species. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. Lophostoma is known for its delicate appearance and is often found growing on the trunks of trees in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
