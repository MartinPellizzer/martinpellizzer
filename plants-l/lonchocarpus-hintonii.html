                    <h1>Lonchocarpus hintonii</h1>
<p>Lonchocarpus hintonii, commonly known as the Hinton's sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain its seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
