                    <h1>Loranthus furcatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus furcatus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds. It is found in various regions of Africa and is part of the Santalaceae family.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both ecological and economic impacts on its host trees.</p>
