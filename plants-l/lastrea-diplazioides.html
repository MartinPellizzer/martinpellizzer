<p>Lastrea diplazioides, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow or green, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
