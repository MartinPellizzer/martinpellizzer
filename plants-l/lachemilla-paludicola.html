                    <h1>Lachemilla paludicola</h1>
<p>Lachemilla paludicola, commonly known as the bog sedum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in the spring. It is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Lachemilla paludicola is an important species for both ecological and botanical studies due to its specialized habitat and unique morphology.</p>
