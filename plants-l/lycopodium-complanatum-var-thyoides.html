                    <h1>Lycopodium complanatum var. thyoides</h1>
<p>Lycopodium complanatum var. thyoides, commonly known as the flatwood clubmoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across the forest floor. This plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded environments, such as pine and hardwood forests. Its sporophytic structures, including strobila, produce spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>L. complanatum var. thyoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
