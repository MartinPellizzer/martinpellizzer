<p>Lycopodium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature, typically growing no taller than a few centimeters, and its dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, produce spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Lycopodium pygmaeum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
