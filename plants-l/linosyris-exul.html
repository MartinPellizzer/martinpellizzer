                    <h1>Linosyris exul</h1>
<p>Linosyris exul, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Linosyris exul is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and drought tolerance make it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
