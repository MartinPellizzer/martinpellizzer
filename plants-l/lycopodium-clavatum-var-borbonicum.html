                    <h1>Lycopodium clavatum var. borbonicum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium clavatum var. borbonicum, commonly known as the Bourbon clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
