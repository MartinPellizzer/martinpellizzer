<p>Larbrea aquatica, commonly known as the water clover, is a aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface.</p>
<p>It has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Larbrea aquatica is often used in water gardens and for natural water filtration due to its ability to improve water quality.</p>
