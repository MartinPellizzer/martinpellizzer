                    <h1>Lycopodium sarmentosum var. rubescens</h1>
<p>Lycopodium sarmentosum var. rubescens, commonly known as the red clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, prostrate growth habit and produces small, reddish stems that often form dense mats. The plant features microphylls, which are small, scale-like leaves, and bears sporophylls that enclose the sporangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>The spores released from the sporangia are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland ecosystems.</p>
