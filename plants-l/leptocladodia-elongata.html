<p>Leptocladodia elongata, commonly known as the elongated cladorhiza, is a rare and specialized marine alga belonging to the order Rhodophyta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, filamentous thallus that forms dense mats on rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters. The plant exhibits a complex life cycle with distinct gametophytic and sporophytic phases, typical of many red algae. Its morphology includes a central axis with lateral branches, and it often displays a reddish to brownish coloration due to the presence of phycoerythrins.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
