                    <h1>Loranthus pancheri</h1>
<p>Loranthus pancheri, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own food through photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruits are typically red or yellow berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>Loranthus pancheri is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in India and Southeast Asia.</p>
