                    <h1>Lycopodium hystrix</h1>
<p>Lycopodium hystrix, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of clubmoss native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its sporophylls are spirally arranged and bear spores on the underside, a feature typical of the Lycopodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Lycopodium hystrix is often found in woodlands and rocky areas, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
