                    <h1>Lotus eriophthalmus</h1>
<p>Lotus eriophthalmus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface that helps repel water.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
