                    <h1>Lycopodium suberectum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium suberectum, commonly known as the erect clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically located at the base of the plant. Lycopodium suberectum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a relic of early plant evolution.</p>
