<p>Leptochloa fusca subsp.</p>
<p>uninervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, grass-like blades with a distinct narrow vein pattern, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in humid environments and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
