<p>Lycopodium cuernavacense, commonly known as the Cuernavaca clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Morelos, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a slender, creeping stem that produces small, scale-like leaves and erect, cone-like strobila that bear spores. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
