                    <h1>Loranthus falcifrons</h1>
<p>Loranthus falcifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the families Rutaceae and Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Loranthus falcifrons plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
