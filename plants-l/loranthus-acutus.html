                    <h1>Loranthus acutus</h1>
<p>Loranthus acutus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland forests.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on the health of its host trees.</p>
