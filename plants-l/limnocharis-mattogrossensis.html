<p>Limnocharis mattogrossensis, commonly known as water shield, is a aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowering stems produce small, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface.</p>
<p>Limnocharis mattogrossensis is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
