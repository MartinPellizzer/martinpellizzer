                    <h1>Lychnis thysanodes</h1>
<p>Lychnis thysanodes, commonly known as the tawny moorgrass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant features upright, branching stems that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its small, pink to reddish-purple flowers are clustered in loose, terminal spikes, and they bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its often-waterlogged environment.</p>
