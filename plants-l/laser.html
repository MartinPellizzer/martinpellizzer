                    <h1>Laser</h1>
<p>Laser, commonly known as a light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, is not a plant but a technological device.</p>
<p>It does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense, as it is not a living organism. However, the term "laser" is sometimes used metaphorically to describe intense light sources in horticultural contexts. In such cases, it may refer to high-intensity grow lights used in plant cultivation.</p>
<p>These artificial light sources mimic sunlight and are essential for photosynthesis in controlled environments.</p>
