                    <h1>Lobivia chrysochete</h1>
<p>Lobivia chrysochete, commonly known as the golden lobivia, is a compact, flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in sparse, pale green spines. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its muted foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent in gardens and collections.</p>
