                    <h1>Lophophora williamsii var. cristata</h1>
<p>Lophophora williamsii var. cristata, commonly known as the Cristata Peyote, is a rare and striking variant of the peyote cactus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, and branched growth form, which sets it apart from the typical cylindrical shape of standard peyote. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among cactus enthusiasts and botanists.</p>
