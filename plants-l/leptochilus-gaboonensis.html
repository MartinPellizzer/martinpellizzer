<p>Leptochilus gaboonensis, commonly known as the Gaboon ironwood, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in white or pale yellow. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are typically eaten by various bird and mammal species. It is well adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of the understorey in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
