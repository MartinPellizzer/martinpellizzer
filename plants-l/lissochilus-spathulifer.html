<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are often covered in a dense network of mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
