<p>Lisaea armena, commonly known as Armenian moss or Armenian liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a simple yet delicate morphology, with small, overlapping leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Lisaea armena plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
