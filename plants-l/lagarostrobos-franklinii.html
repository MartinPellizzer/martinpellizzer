                    <h1>Lagarostrobos franklinii</h1>
<p>Lagarostrobos franklinii, commonly known as the Franklin's pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the wet forests of Tasmania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both male and female cones on the same tree. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones that mature over several years.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is considered one of the most endangered tree species in the world.</p>
