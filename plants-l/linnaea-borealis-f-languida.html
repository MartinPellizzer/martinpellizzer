<p>Linnaea borealis f. languida, commonly known as the languid twinflower, is a rare and delicate variant of the twinflower plant.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and parts of Eurasia. The plant features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often in pairs. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, with a leathery texture adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its reduced floral display and more elongated, drooping stems compared to the typical twinflower.</p>
