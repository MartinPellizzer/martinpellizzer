                    <h1>Leontopodium arbuscula</h1>
<p>Leontopodium arbuscula, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and neighboring mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale green foliage and its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in harsh, rocky environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and a popular subject in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is also a protected species in many regions.</p>
