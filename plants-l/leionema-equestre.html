                    <h1>Leionema equestre</h1>
<p>Leionema equestre, commonly known as the horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five to seven lobes, and its showy white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces spiny capsules that contain bright red seeds, which are often used in ornamental settings. It is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it is not related to true chestnuts and does not produce edible nuts.</p>
