<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, succulent leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its leaves and stems.</p>
