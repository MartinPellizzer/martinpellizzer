                    <h1>Lobelia siphilitica var. grandis</h1>
<p>Lobelia siphilitica var. grandis, commonly known as great lobelia, is a striking perennial wildflower native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features showy, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom from June to September, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite and hairy. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its historical association with syphilis, though it has no medicinal connection to the disease.</p>
