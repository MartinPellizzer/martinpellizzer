                    <h1>Loranthus aurantiacus var. parviflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus aurantiacus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the dwarf orange mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered, orange-red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. Its leaves are small, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or orange in color.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to the typical variety of Loranthus aurantiacus.</p>
