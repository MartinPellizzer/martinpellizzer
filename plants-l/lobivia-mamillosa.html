<p>Lobivia mamillosa, commonly known as the Woolly Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant typically has a short, thick stem with clusters of small, rounded tubercles. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Lobivia mamillosa is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
