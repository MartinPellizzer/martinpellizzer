                    <h1>Loranthus kingii</h1>
<p>Loranthus kingii, commonly known as the King's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
