                    <h1>Linconia alopecuroidea</h1>
<p>Linconia alopecuroidea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
