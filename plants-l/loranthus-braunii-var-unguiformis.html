                    <h1>Loranthus braunii var. unguiformis</h1>
<p>Loranthus braunii var. unguiformis, commonly known as the red-fruit mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive red calyx that becomes fleshy and berry-like.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
