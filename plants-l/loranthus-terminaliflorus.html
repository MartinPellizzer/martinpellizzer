                    <h1>Loranthus terminaliflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus terminaliflorus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its fruits are typically berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, often growing in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
