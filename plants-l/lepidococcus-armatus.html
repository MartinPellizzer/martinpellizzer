<p>Lepidococcus armatus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in spring. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp.</p>
<p>The plant's spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
