                    <h1>Lastreopsis glabella</h1>
<p>Lastreopsis glabella, commonly known as the smooth-leaved liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its closely packed, smooth, and often shiny leaves that form dense mats on rocky surfaces. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or in crevices of rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the leaf surfaces and produce male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having specialized structures for absorption and anchoring.</p>
