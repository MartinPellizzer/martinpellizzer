<p>Lonicera venulosa, commonly known as the yellow honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its red, berry-like fruits mature in the fall and are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Lonicera venulosa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
