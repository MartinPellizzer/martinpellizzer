                    <h1>Lastrea grammitoides</h1>
<p>Lastrea grammitoides, commonly known as the sandmat, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
