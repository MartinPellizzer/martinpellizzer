                    <h1>Limnophila villifera var. gracilipes</h1>
<p>Limnophila villifera var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender water willow, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, with its slender, ribbon-like leaves floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikes, which are usually submerged or partially submerged. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in phytoremediation.</p>
