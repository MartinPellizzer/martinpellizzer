<p>Lomatia dentata, commonly known as the mountain devil, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive serrated edge, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Lomatia dentata is adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
