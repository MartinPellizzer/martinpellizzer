                    <h1>Leucothoe coriacea</h1>
<p>Leucothoe coriacea, commonly known as rough leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features elongated, dark green leaves that are covered in a thick, leathery cuticle, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit also makes it effective for erosion control in forested areas.</p>
