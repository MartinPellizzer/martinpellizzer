                    <h1>Lipochaeta succulenta var. trifida</h1>
<p>Lipochaeta succulenta var. trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed lipochaeta, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments.</p>
