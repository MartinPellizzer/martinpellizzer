                    <h1>Loranthus polycarpus</h1>
<p>Loranthus polycarpus, commonly known as the many-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating the plant's spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>Its growth is often limited by the availability of suitable host trees and environmental conditions.</p>
