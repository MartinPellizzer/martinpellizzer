                    <h1>Lithophila muscoides var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Lithophila muscoides var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in open, sunny habitats, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are short and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and reduced leaf size compared to the typical form of Lithophila muscoides.</p>
