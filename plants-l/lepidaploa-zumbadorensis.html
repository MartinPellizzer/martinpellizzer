<p>Lepidaploa zumbadorensis, commonly known as the Zumbadorensis lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are short and often hidden beneath the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepidaploa zumbadorensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
