                    <h1>Lepanthes tulcanensis</h1>
<p>Lepanthes tulcanensis, commonly known as the Tulc√°n Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America, specifically found in cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink coloration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
