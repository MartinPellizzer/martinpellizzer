                    <h1>Lumnitzera racemosa var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Lumnitzera racemosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the mangrove with hairy leaves, is a variant of the mangrove species Lumnitzera racemosa.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as tidal mudflats and estuaries. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are pubescent, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against salt spray.</p>
<p>This variant plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
