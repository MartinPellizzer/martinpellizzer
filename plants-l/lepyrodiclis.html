                    <h1>Lepyrodiclis</h1>
<p>Lepyrodiclis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, making it highly specialized. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Lepyrodiclis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
