<p>Lemna obscura, commonly known as the dark duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically darker in color compared to other duckweed species. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing ones.</p>
<p>Lemna obscura is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments and can play a role in water filtration and as a food source for aquatic organisms.</p>
