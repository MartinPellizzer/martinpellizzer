                    <h1>Leucosceptrum stellipilum var. formosanum</h1>
<p>Leucosceptrum stellipilum var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan star-tongue fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds with a distinctive pattern of small, spiny teeth along the margins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in montane forests, where it grows on rocky or mossy substrates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
