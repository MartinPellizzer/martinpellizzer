<p>Listera ovata f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved twayblade, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ovata group of the genus Listera, characterized by its reduced, scale-like leaves and a unique floral structure. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
