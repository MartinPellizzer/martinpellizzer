<p>Leptogramma jinfoshanensis, commonly known as the Jinfoshan fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it exhibits a unique reproductive structure compared to other ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
