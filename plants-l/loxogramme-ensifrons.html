                    <h1>Loxogramme ensifrons</h1>
<p>Loxogramme ensifrons, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating the spread of new growth.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its wetland environment.</p>
