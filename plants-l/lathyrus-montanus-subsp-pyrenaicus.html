<p>Lathyrus montanus subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean grasspea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant produces pods containing edible seeds, though the foliage and seeds contain toxic alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested in large quantities. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
