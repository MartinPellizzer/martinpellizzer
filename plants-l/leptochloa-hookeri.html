<p>Leptochloa hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's slender grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, tufted perennial grass that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact growth habit, which help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Leptochloa hookeri is often found in temperate regions of Asia and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
