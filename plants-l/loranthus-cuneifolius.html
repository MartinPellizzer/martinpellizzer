                    <h1>Loranthus cuneifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a leathery texture and a distinctive aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Loranthus cuneifolius plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
