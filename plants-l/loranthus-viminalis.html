                    <h1>Loranthus viminalis</h1>
<p>Loranthus viminalis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes considered a pest.</p>
