                    <h1>Loranthus ternatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ternatus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or greenish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus ternatus is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often considered a traditional medicinal plant.</p>
