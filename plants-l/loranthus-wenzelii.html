                    <h1>Loranthus wenzelii</h1>
<p>Loranthus wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, leathery leaves and white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
