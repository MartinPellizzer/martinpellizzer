                    <h1>Lalldhwojia cooperi</h1>
<p>Lalldhwojia cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lalldhwojia cooperi is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
