<p>Leersia debilis, commonly known as slender leersia, is a low-growing grass species native to moist, shaded environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other areas with consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and ecological role in stabilizing soil make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
