                    <h1>Lobivia tiegeliana var. flaviflora</h1>
<p>Lobivia tiegeliana var. flaviflora, commonly known as the Yellow-flowered Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
