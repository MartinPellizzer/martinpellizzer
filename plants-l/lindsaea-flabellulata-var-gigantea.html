<p>Lindsaea flabellulata var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant lindera, is a striking epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of over two meters, making it one of the largest fern species in its genus. The plant's fronds are typically broad and leathery, with a distinctive, fan-like arrangement of pinnae. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
