                    <h1>Lemna major</h1>
<p>Lemna major, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are often less than 1 cm in diameter, and it lacks true roots, instead having root-like structures called rhizoids. The plant reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation, making it highly adaptable. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
