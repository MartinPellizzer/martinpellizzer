<p>Lysiphyllum binatum, commonly known as the red sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in tropical and subtropical waters.</p>
<p>It belongs to the class Anthozoa and is characterized by its vibrant red coloration and delicate, feathery tentacles. The organism lacks a true body cavity and is sessile, attaching itself to surfaces in its aquatic environment. It relies on symbiotic algae for nutrition, which live within its tissues and provide energy through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Lysiphyllum binatum plays a role in marine ecosystems by serving as a food source for various predators.</p>
