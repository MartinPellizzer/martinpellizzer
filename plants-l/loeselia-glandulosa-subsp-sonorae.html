<p>Loeselia glandulosa subsp.</p>
<p>sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran loeselia, is a shrub native to the Sonoran Desert region. It features small, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
