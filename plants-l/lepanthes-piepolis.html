                    <h1>Lepanthes piepolis</h1>
<p>Lepanthes piepolis, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a lady's slipper in shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often epiphytic on tree bark or mossy substrates. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Lepanthes piepolis is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
