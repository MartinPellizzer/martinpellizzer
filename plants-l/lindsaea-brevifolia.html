<p>Lindsaea brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators. Its small, white flowers are often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Lindsaea brevifolia plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by supporting various insect and bird species.</p>
