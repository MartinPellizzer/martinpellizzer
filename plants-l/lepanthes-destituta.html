                    <h1>Lepanthes destituta</h1>
<p>Lepanthes destituta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on air and rain for nutrients rather than soil. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding atmosphere.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Lepanthes destituta is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
