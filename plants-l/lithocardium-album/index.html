                            <h1>Lithocardium Album</h1>
<p>Lithocardium album is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is known for its striking white petals and ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. This species belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. Its unique adaptations make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike. Due to habitat loss, Lithocardium album faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
