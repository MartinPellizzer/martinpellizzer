<p>Libocedrus uvifera, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood and feathery foliage. The plant has scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the branches. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its historical importance in traditional Hawaiian culture and its rarity in the wild, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
