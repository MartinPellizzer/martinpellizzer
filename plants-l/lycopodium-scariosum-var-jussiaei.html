                    <h1>Lycopodium scariosum var. jussiaei</h1>
<p>Lycopodium scariosum var. jussiaei, commonly known as the Jussiaei clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
