                    <h1>Lecanorchis</h1>
<p>Lecanorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Lecanorchis has a short, stocky rhizome with few leaves, and its flowers are typically clustered in a spike.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive species, often found in shaded, moist environments such as cypress swamps.</p>
