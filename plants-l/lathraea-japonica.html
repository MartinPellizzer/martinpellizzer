                    <h1>Lathraea japonica</h1>
<p>Lathraea japonica, commonly known as the Japanese parasitic orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are adapted to attach to the roots of host plants, allowing it to absorb necessary resources.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Lathraea japonica plays a minor ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
