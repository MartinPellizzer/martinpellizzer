                    <h1>Larix russica</h1>
<p>Larix russica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn, giving the tree a distinctive seasonal appearance. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is lightweight and strong, making it valuable for construction and paper production.</p>
<p>The Siberian larch is well adapted to harsh environments, with a shallow root system and a capacity to withstand extreme cold.</p>
