                    <h1>Loranthus formicarum</h1>
<p>Loranthus formicarum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of trees, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, often reddish or yellowish flowers. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The ant plant plays a unique ecological role by providing shelter and food for certain ant species, which in turn help protect it from herbivores.</p>
