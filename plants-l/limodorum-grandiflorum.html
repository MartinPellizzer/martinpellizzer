                    <h1>Limodorum grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Limodorum grandiflorum, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, horizontal rhizome and linear, grass-like leaves that grow from the base. Its flowers are borne on tall, slender stems and are often clustered in spikes.</p>
<p>The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological niche in moist, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
