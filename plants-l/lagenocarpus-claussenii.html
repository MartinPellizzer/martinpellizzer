                    <h1>Lagenocarpus claussenii</h1>
<p>Lagenocarpus claussenii, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small perennial herb native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Lagenocarpus claussenii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support biodiversity.</p>
