<p>Lithops gesineae subsp.</p>
<p>annae, commonly known as the "Fairy Stone" or "Living Rock," is a member of the Aizoaceae family native to South Africa. This succulent plant is characterized by its pair of fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically pale green to bluish-gray, with subtle markings that aid in camouflage. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low water requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
