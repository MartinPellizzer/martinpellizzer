                    <h1>Lindera pedicellata</h1>
<p>Lindera pedicellata, commonly known as the fragrant lindera, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant foliage and showy fruiting display.</p>
