                    <h1>Loranthus biangulatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus biangulatus, commonly known as the two-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments.</p>
