<p>Lycopodium albidulum, commonly known as the white clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense clusters of narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodium albidulum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
