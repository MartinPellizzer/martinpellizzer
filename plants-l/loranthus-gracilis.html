                    <h1>Loranthus gracilis</h1>
<p>Loranthus gracilis, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are usually clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries that contain the seeds. Loranthus gracilis is native to Australia and is often found in forested areas with suitable host trees.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystem, supporting various insect and bird species.</p>
