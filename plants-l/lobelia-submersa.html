                    <h1>Lobelia submersa</h1>
<p>Lobelia submersa, commonly known as the submerged lobelia, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, whorled leaves that are typically submerged in water, adapting to its aquatic habitat. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that emerge above the water surface, making it visually distinctive. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Lobelia submersa plays an important role in supporting aquatic biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
