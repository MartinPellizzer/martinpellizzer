                    <h1>Lonicera repens</h1>
<p>Lonicera repens, commonly known as creeping honeysuckle, is a low-growing perennial vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Lonicera repens is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover ground and prevent erosion, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
