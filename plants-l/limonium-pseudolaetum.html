<p>Limonium pseudolaetum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, blue-to-purple flower heads that resemble small, clustered holly berries. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Limonium pseudolaetum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions.</p>
