<p>Lygodium acuminatum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a unique climbing habit, using its rhizomes to attach to trees and other structures. Its spores are produced in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Lygodium acuminatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
