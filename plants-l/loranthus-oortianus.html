                    <h1>Loranthus oortianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus oortianus, commonly known as the Oort's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds. Its life cycle involves seed dispersal by animals, particularly through the droppings of frugivorous birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus oortianus plays a role in ecological interactions, influencing both its host trees and the local fauna.</p>
