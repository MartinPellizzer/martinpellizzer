                    <h1>Loranthus bibracteolatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus bibracteolatus, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish, followed by small, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is native to regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host trees.</p>
