                    <h1>Loranthus chloranthus</h1>
<p>Loranthus chloranthus, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light captured by its host's leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the bark of suitable host trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
