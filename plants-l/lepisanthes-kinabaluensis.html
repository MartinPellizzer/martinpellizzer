<p>Lepisanthes kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu lepisanthes, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of montane rainforests, where it thrives in shaded, well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem as a source of nectar and habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
