                    <h1>Lobivia nealeana var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Lobivia nealeana var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Neale's Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
