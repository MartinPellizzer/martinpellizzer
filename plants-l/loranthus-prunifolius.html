                    <h1>Loranthus prunifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus prunifolius, commonly known as the dogwood dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily those in the rose family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fruit and later excrete the seeds.</p>
<p>Loranthus prunifolius is often found in forested areas and can be a common sight in regions with suitable host plants.</p>
