The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
