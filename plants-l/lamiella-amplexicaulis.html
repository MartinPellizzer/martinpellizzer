                    <h1>Lamiella amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Lamiella amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly interwoven thallus with a dark, leathery texture and a distinct, often bright orange or yellowish color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which provides it with nutrients and structural support. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
