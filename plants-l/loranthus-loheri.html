                    <h1>Loranthus loheri</h1>
<p>Loranthus loheri, commonly known as the Loher's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It lacks roots of its own and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides organic compounds through photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Loranthus loheri plays a role in ecological interactions, influencing the health and structure of its host trees.</p>
