<p>Laplacea reticularis, commonly known as the net-veined lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique botanical structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, network-like thallus with distinct, interwoven veins. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in various environments. Its growth pattern is typically crustose, adhering tightly to surfaces such as bark or rock.</p>
<p>Laplacea reticularis is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in ecological succession and soil stabilization.</p>
