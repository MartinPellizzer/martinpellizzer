<p>Lycopodium complanatum f. typicum, commonly known as the flat clubmoss, is a fern ally belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, creeping plant with a prostrate growth habit, characterized by its narrow, linear leaves arranged in two rows. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and primitive structure make it an important species for studying the evolution of vascular plants.</p>
