<p>Leptogramma totta, commonly known as the slender leathery fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
