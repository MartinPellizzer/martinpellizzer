                    <h1>Loranthus cactorum</h1>
<p>Loranthus cactorum, commonly known as the mistletoe vine, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and influencing the health of its host trees.</p>
