                    <h1>Lycopodium clavatum var. piliferum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium clavatum var. piliferum, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear spirally arranged leaves, which are typically scale-like and densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces strobila, or cone-like structures, at the tips of its branches, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in the eastern United States and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems.</p>
