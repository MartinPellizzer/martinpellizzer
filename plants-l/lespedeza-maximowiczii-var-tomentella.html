<p>Lespedeza maximowiczii var. tomentella, commonly known as woolly lespedeza, is a perennial shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its hairy texture, which gives it the common name, helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
