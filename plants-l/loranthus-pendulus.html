                    <h1>Loranthus pendulus</h1>
<p>Loranthus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus pendulus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
