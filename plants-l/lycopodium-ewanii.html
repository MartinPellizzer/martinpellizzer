<p>Lycopodium ewanii, commonly known as the Ewan's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Lycopodium ewanii is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and botanical importance.</p>
