<p>Lindsaea ensifolia subsp.</p>
<p>agatii, commonly known as the Agatti feather-fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are slender and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
