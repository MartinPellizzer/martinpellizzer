<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that resemble a dog's tongue, hence its common name.

Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and they bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The species is known for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name.</p>
