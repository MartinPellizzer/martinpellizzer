<p>Lygistum ignitum var. micans, commonly known as the glowing nightshade, is a striking plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black foliage and vibrant, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow in the dark. The plant's leaves are glossy and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its flowers, which bloom at night, attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and scientific interest.</p>
