                    <h1>Lagarosiphon muscoides</h1>
<p>Lagarosiphon muscoides, commonly known as the water plantain, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging from the water's surface. It is commonly found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local aquatic ecosystems.</p>
