<p>Lobivia aguilari, commonly known as the Aguilari lobivia, is a species of cactus native to northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
