<p>Lagopus lanceolatus, commonly known as the slender snowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Lagopus lanceolatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for herbivores in its harsh environment.</p>
