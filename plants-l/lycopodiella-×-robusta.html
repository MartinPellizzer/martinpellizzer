                    <h1>Lycopodiella × robusta</h1>
<p>Lycopodiella × robusta, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a fern ally that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Lycopodiella cernua and Lycopodiella tamariscina. This plant exhibits a creeping growth habit with dense, scale-like leaves that form a mat on the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The botanical interest in Lycopodiella × robusta lies in its unique morphology and role in studying hybridization in ancient plant lineages.</p>
