                    <h1>Lycopodium clavatum var. distachyum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium clavatum var. distachyum, commonly known as the club moss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a primitive vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces sporophylls that enclose the spores, which are released through a specialized structure called a strobilus. Its rhizome is often branched and serves as a storage organ for nutrients.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its two-branched strobili, which give it its specific epithet "distachyum.".</p>
