<p>Lindsaea roxasii, commonly known as the Philippine mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Philippines and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis. The plant has a delicate, vine-like structure with small, ovate leaves and produces inconspicuous flowers followed by berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Lindsaea roxasii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
