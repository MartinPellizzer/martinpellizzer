                    <h1>Loranthus brunneus var. durandii</h1>
<p>Loranthus brunneus var. durandii, commonly known as the Durand's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including India and Indonesia, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic nature and ornamental appearance make it a subject of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
