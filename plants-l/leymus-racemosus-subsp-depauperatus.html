<p>Leymus racemosus subsp.</p>
<p>depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse Leymus, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and its potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
