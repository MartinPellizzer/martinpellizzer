                    <h1>Lepidium oahuense</h1>
<p>Lepidium oahuense, commonly known as Oahu cress, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky areas and has a low, spreading habit with small, pinnately divided leaves. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Lepidium oahuense is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws.</p>
