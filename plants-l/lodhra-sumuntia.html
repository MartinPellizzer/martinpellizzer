                    <h1>Lodhra sumuntia</h1>
<p>Lodhra sumuntia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Eastern Himalayas, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Nepal and India.</p>
<p>It features showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, often floating on the surface of still water. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often submerged, with a waxy texture that helps it float. Its root system is extensive, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of its habitat while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Lodhra sumuntia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
