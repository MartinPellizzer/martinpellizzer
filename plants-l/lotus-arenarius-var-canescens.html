                    <h1>Lotus arenarius var. canescens</h1>
<p>Lotus arenarius var. canescens, commonly known as the sand lotus or desert lotus, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
