                    <h1>Launaea courtetiana</h1>
<p>Launaea courtetiana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with a succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and often lobed, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Launaea courtetiana is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
