                    <h1>Loranthus dregei var. subcurvifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus dregei var. subcurvifolius, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species is native to southern Africa and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
