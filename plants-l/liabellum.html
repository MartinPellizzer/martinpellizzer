                    <h1>Liabellum</h1>
<p>Liabellum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree bark. Its unique growth habit and limited natural range make it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
<p>Botanists classify it in the genus Dendrophylax, which includes other epiphytic orchids with similar features.</p>
