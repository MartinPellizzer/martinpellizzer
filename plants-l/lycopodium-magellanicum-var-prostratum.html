                    <h1>Lycopodium magellanicum var. prostratum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium magellanicum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems, giving it a compact appearance. It produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are usually located at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is adapted to thrive in cool, humid climates.</p>
