<p>Limnosciadium pinnatum, commonly known as the water fern, is a member of the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is a floating aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its small, green, four-leaf clover-like structures are often used for water filtration and as a habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Limnosciadium pinnatum plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
