                    <h1>Lophochloa cristata var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Lophochloa cristata var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. One notable feature is its viviparous trait, where some seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation may enhance its reproductive success in disturbed or nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
