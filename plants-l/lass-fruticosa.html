                    <h1>Lass fruticosa</h1>
<p>Lass fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal bush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Lass fruticosa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
