<p>Leptosiphon septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It produces trifoliate leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Leptosiphon septentrionalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
