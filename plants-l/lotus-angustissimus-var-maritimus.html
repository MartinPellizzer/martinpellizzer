<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions and support local biodiversity.</p>
