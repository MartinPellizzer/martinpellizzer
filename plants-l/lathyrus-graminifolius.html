                    <h1>Lathyrus graminifolius</h1>
<p>Lathyrus graminifolius, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval leaflets arranged on either side of a central stem.</p>
<p>Lathyrus graminifolius is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
