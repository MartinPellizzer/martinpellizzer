                    <h1>Larix × pendula</h1>
<p>Larix × pendula, commonly known as the weeping larch, is a hybrid coniferous tree that combines traits from its parent species, Larix decidua and Larix leptolepis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the conifer family. Its needles are short and feathery, turning a vibrant yellow in the fall before shedding.</p>
<p>Larix × pendula is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates.</p>
