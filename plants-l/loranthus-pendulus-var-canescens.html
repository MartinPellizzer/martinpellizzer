                    <h1>Loranthus pendulus var. canescens</h1>
<p>Loranthus pendulus var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The berries it bears are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
