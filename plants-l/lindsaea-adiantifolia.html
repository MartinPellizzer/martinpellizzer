<p>Lindsaea adiantifolia, commonly known as the fern moss or narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Lindsaea adiantifolia plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
