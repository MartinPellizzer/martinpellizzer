                    <h1>Lyrolepis piae</h1>
<p>Lyrolepis piae, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion plant, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, cushion-like growth with tightly packed, spiny leaves that are typically green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
