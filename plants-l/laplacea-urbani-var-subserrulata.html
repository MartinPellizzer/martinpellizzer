                    <h1>Laplacea urbani var. subserrulata</h1>
<p>Laplacea urbani var. subserrulata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed laplacea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of leaves that are lanceolate and have finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a loose raceme during the summer months. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
