<p>Linostoma leucodipterum, commonly known as the white-winged dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its fruit is a small, hairy achene that is dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Linostoma leucodipterum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
