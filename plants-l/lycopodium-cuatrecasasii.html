<p>Lycopodium cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' clubmoss, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing structures called strobili. Lycopodium cuatrecasasii is characterized by its unique morphology and is often found in high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
