                    <h1>Lonicera japonica f. quercifolia</h1>
<p>Lonicera japonica f. quercifolia, commonly known as Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It has a rapid growth rate and is often considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though its ecological impact requires careful management.</p>
