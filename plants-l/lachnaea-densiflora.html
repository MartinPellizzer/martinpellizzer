                    <h1>Lachnaea densiflora</h1>
<p>Lachnaea densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its closely packed, leaf-like thallus with a dark green to blackish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the necessary photosynthetic function. Its dense, compact growth habit allows it to retain moisture effectively in its preferred habitat.</p>
<p>Lachnaea densiflora is often found on decaying wood or stone in temperate regions.</p>
