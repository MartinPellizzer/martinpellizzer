<p>Linnaea borealis f. sanguinea, commonly known as the blood-tipped twinflower, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower plant.</p>
<p>This botanical form is characterized by its distinctive red-tipped leaves, which set it apart from the typical green foliage of the standard species. It is native to the boreal forests of North America and parts of Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate beauty to the forest floor.</p>
