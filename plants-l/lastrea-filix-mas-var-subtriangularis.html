                    <h1>Lastrea filix-mas var. subtriangularis</h1>
<p>Lastrea filix-mas var. subtriangularis, commonly known as the variegated snake plant, is a succulent perennial native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with white or yellow variegation. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers on slender stalks, though it is more prized for its foliage than its blooms.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying properties.</p>
