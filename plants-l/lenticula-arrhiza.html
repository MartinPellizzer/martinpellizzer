                    <h1>Lenticula arrhiza</h1>
<p>Lenticula arrhiza, commonly known as the rootless lenticular plant, is a unique species characterized by its lack of traditional roots.</p>
<p>Instead of roots, it possesses specialized structures called lenticels that facilitate gas exchange. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments where it can absorb nutrients through its stem and leaves. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in specific ecological niches, often in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>The absence of roots makes it particularly sensitive to environmental changes, influencing its distribution and survival.</p>
