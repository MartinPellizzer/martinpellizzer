                    <h1>Lithops marginata</h1>
<p>Lithops marginata, commonly known as the narrow-margin stone plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leaf-like structures called "tubercles," which are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water. The plant's leaves are typically green with white or yellow margins, providing a camouflage effect in its natural habitat. It blooms with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months.</p>
<p>Lithops marginata is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
