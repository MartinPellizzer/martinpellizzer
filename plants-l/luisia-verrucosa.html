<p>Luisia verrucosa, commonly known as the warty lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety thallus covered with small, wart-like structures called pseudopores. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
