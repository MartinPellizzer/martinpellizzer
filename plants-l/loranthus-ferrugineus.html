                    <h1>Loranthus ferrugineus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty or yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its berries are a food source for birds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to its host.</p>
