                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. curtiloba</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. curtiloba, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that are typically a glossy dark green, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in cold climates. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its berries, which are red and edible, ripen in late summer and are a food source for various birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique growth habit, with stems that often trail along the ground, forming dense mats in forest understories.</p>
