                    <h1>Lobelia ekmanii</h1>
<p>Lobelia ekmanii, commonly known as the Cape York lobelia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforest understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, which are attracted to its nectar.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lobelia ekmanii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
