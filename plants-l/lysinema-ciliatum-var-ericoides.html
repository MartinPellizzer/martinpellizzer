<p>Lysinema ciliatum var. ericoides, commonly known as the creeping snowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, berry-like flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, poisonous berries that remain on the plant throughout the summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Berberidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
