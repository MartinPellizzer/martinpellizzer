                    <h1>Loranthus karibibensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus karibibensis, commonly known as the Karibib mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as acacias and eucalyptus, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
