<p>Leontodon bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, robust stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its bulbous base allows it to store nutrients, aiding survival in less favorable conditions.</p>
<p>Leontodon bulbosus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
