                    <h1>Lepechiniella microcarpa subsp. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Lepechiniella microcarpa subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited lepechiniella, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of central Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, small, oval-shaped leaves, and tiny, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain minute seeds, typical of many species in the Lamiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in arid ecosystems and its resilience to environmental stress.</p>
