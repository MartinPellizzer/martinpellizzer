                    <h1>Loxanthocereus xylorhizus</h1>
<p>Loxanthocereus xylorhizus, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains, and it can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>The cactus has a slow growth rate and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
