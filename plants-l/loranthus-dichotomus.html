                    <h1>Loranthus dichotomus</h1>
<p>Loranthus dichotomus, commonly known as the two-branched mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions in Africa and is often found on acacia and eucalyptus trees. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in groups. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health of its host trees.</p>
