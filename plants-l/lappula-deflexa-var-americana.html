<p>Lappula deflexa var. americana, commonly known as American lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils along stream banks, marshes, and other wetland habitats. The plant has erect stems that are usually branched and covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a distinctive downward-curving tip, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a beak-like structure called a utricle, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
