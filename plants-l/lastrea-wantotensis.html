                    <h1>Lastrea wantotensis</h1>
<p>Lastrea wantotensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert lichen, is a unique organism that thrives in the extreme arid conditions of the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, a composite organism formed by the symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant-like organism is adapted to survive with minimal water, relying on moisture from fog and dew. Its structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Lastrea wantotensis plays a crucial role in the desert ecosystem by contributing to soil stabilization and providing a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
