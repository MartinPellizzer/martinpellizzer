                    <h1>Loranthus macklottianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus macklottianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
