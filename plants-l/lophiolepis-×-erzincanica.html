                    <h1>Lophiolepis × erzincanica</h1>
<p>Lophiolepis × erzincanica, commonly known as the Erzincan lichen, is a hybrid species belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a crustose lichen that forms a dense, tightly adherent growth on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is composed of a complex interweaving of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together contribute to its ability to survive in harsh conditions. It is characterized by a pale yellow to orange-brown coloration and lacks distinct lobes or pores.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest in lichenology due to its geographic distribution and ecological adaptations.</p>
