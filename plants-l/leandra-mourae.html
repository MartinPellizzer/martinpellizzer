                    <h1>Leandra mourae</h1>
<p>Leandra mourae, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid or *Leandra mourae*, is a species of orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and it relies on its host for physical support. Its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in the region.</p>
<p>Leandra mourae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
