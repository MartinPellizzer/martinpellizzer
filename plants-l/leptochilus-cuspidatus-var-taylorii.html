                    <h1>Leptochilus cuspidatus var. taylorii</h1>
<p>Leptochilus cuspidatus var. taylorii, commonly known as Taylor's spike moss, is a species of pleurocarpous moss belonging to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, acrostichal leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral. The plant forms dense, low-growing mats on moist, shaded forest floors, often in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect shoots called caulocarps.</p>
<p>This moss is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>
