                    <h1>Lobelia niihauensis var. meridiana</h1>
<p>Lobelia niihauensis var. meridiana, commonly known as the Niihau lobelia, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Niihau.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
