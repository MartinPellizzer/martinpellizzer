                            <h1>Lavandula Stricta Var. Subtropica</h1>
<p>Spanish lavender, scientifically known as Lavandula stricta var. subtropica, is a unique and hardy plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is prized for its fragrant purple flowers and compact growth habit, making it ideal for small spaces and rock gardens. This variety is particularly adapted to warmer climates, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its resilience and ornamental value have made it a popular choice among gardeners and landscapers. With its soothing scent and low maintenance requirements, Spanish lavender remains a beloved addition to both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
