<p>Licania araneosa, commonly known as the spider vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Licania araneosa is often found growing along forest edges and in disturbed areas, where it can thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain environments.</p>
