                    <h1>Leptoglottis mimosoides</h1>
<p>Leptoglottis mimosoides, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as pines and kauri. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
