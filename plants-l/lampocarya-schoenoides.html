<p>Lampocarya schoenoides, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery, woolly leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a taproot system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are followed by elongated, bract-like structures that enclose the seed capsules.</p>
