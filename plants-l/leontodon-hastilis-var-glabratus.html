<p>Leontodon hastilis var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a robust stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its yellow ray florets are surrounded by a series of tubular disk florets, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage, which sets it apart from other variants of Leontodon hastilis.</p>
