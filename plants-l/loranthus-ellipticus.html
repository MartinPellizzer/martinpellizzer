                    <h1>Loranthus ellipticus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Asia and is often seen growing on trees like the tamarind and mango.</p>
