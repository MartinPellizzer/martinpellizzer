<p>Lycopodioides pectinata, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes with spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical cones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, contributing to its survival in humid, temperate climates.</p>
