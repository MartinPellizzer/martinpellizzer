                <h1>Lobaria hederacea</h1>
<p>Lobaria hederacea, commonly known as the common lungwort lichen, is a foliose lichen that grows on tree bark, particularly in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, lobed thallus with a distinctive pattern of white, yellow, and green pores. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with green algae, which provide photosynthetic energy, while the fungal component offers structural support. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found on the trunks of deciduous trees.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, it is an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
