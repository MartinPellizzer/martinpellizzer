<p>Loranthus zygiarum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent, using haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or greenish in color. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus zygiarum plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
