<p>Leptodermis glauca, commonly known as the blue-green moss, is a member of the family Lejeuneaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, cryptogamic plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green to bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Leptodermis glauca plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
