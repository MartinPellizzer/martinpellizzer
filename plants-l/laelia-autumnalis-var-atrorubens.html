                    <h1>Laelia autumnalis var. atrorubens</h1>
<p>Laelia autumnalis var. atrorubens, commonly known as the autumn laelia, is a hybrid orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers with a dark, velvety throat, which give it its varietal name "atrorubens.". The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It prefers cool, high-altitude environments with bright, indirect light and moderate humidity.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent in many modern orchid hybrids due to its vigorous growth and showy blooms.</p>
