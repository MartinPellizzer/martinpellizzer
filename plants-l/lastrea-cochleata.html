<p>Lastrea cochleata, commonly known as the spiral leaf cactus, is a species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a decorative element to its appearance. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
