                    <h1>Lycopodium mingcheense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium mingcheense, commonly known as the Mingcheense clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, typical of many clubmosses. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
