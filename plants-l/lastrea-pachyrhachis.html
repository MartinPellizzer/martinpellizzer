<p>Lastrea pachyrhachis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is an excellent plant for container gardening.</p>
