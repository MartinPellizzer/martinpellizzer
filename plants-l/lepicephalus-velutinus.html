<p>Lepicephalus velutinus, commonly known as the velvet-headed lemur, is a unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant has small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment.</p>
<p>Lepicephalus velutinus is also notable for its slow growth rate and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
