                    <h1>Lichtensteinia obscura</h1>
<p>Lichtensteinia obscura, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The lichen consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. It is often found on shaded, calcareous substrates and is used as an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant organism.</p>
