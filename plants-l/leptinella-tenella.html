                    <h1>Leptinella tenella</h1>
<p>Leptinella tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
