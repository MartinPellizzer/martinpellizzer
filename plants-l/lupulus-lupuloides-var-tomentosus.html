<p>Lupulus lupuloides var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly hop, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobiles, which are used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from other hop species, particularly its dense pubescence and specific habitat preferences.</p>
