                    <h1>Loranthus pekanensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus pekanensis, commonly known as the Pekan Mountain mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Dipterocarpaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves and small, red berries that contain the seeds. It is typically found in the rainforests of Borneo, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
