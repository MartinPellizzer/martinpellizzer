                    <h1>Lycopodina</h1>
<p>Lycopodina, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. Lycopodina typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many ancient plant groups.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ancient lineage provide valuable insights into the evolution of vascular plants.</p>
