<p>Ligustrina reticulata f. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate ligustra, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, black berries in the fall. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'bracteata' is distinguished by its presence of bracts, which are modified leaves that often surround the flowers.</p>
