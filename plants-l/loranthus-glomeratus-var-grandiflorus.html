                    <h1>Loranthus glomeratus var. grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus glomeratus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white or yellowish berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found on native trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
