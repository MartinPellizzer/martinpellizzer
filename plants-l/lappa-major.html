                    <h1>Lappa major</h1>
<p>Lappa major, commonly known as greater hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive reddish stem that is often covered in coarse hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, known as umbels, during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and can pose a danger to humans and animals.</p>
