                    <h1>Leptonychia usambarica</h1>
<p>Leptonychia usambarica, commonly known as the Usambaran fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Leptonychia usambarica is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation and botanical research.</p>
