The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Lonicera flavida is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
