                    <h1>Loranthus sarmentosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus sarmentosus, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of various trees, including those in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are usually small, opposite, and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Loranthus sarmentosus plays a role in ecological interactions, influencing the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
