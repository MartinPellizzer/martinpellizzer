                    <h1>Lonicera tatarica f. nana</h1>
<p>Lonicera tatarica f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf honeysuckle, is a compact shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of yellow and white. The plant has slender, arching stems and elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit.</p>
<p>The nana form is a naturally occurring variant that results in a more compact growth compared to the standard species.</p>
