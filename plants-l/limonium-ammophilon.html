                    <h1>Limonium ammophilon</h1>
<p>Limonium ammophilon, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in saline and windy conditions.</p>
<p>Limonium ammophilon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting pollinator populations.</p>
