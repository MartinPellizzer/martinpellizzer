                    <h1>Lychnocephalus jolyanus</h1>
<p>Lychnocephalus jolyanus, commonly known as the Joly's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Lychnocephalus jolyanus is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
