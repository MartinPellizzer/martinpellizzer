<p>Limodorum athense, commonly known as the Athens lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive hooded shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Limodorum athense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
