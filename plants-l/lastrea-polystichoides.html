<p>Lastrea polystichoides, commonly known as the silver leaf sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
