<p>Lycopodioides platybasis, commonly known as the broad-leaf clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing cones.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil. Its reproductive structures, called strobili, contain the spores necessary for propagation.</p>
<p>Lycopodioides platybasis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
