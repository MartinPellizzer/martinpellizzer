                    <h1>Loranthus ruber</h1>
<p>Loranthus ruber, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its flowers are typically white or pink and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Loranthus ruber is often found in temperate regions and can be a common sight in forests and woodlands.</p>
