                    <h1>Lycopodioides simplex</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides simplex, commonly known as the simple clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the stem, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its primitive structure, it provides valuable insights into the early evolution of vascular plants.</p>
