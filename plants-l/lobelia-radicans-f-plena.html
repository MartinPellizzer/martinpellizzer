                    <h1>Lobelia radicans f. plena</h1>
<p>Lobelia radicans f. plena, commonly known as the trailing lobelia or silver leaf lobelia, is a compact, trailing perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or pale pink throat. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically silver or gray-green, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and container gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant, continuous bloom throughout the growing season.</p>
