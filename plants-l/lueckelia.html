                    <h1>Lueckelia</h1>
<p>Lueckelia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Lueckelia requires a humid, shaded environment with high air circulation to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
