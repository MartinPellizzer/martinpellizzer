<p>Lycopodium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its central stem, giving it a compact appearance. Its sporophylls, which bear the spores, are arranged in whorls along the stem and are often covered in a layer of fine, hairy structures.</p>
<p>Lycopodium microphyllum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
