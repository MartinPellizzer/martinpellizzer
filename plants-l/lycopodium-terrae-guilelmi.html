<p>Lycopodium terrae-guilelmi, commonly known as the Guilelmite clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces sporophytes that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the lycopod family.</p>
