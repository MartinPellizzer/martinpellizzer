                    <h1>Loxogramme lanceolata var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Loxogramme lanceolata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically floating or submerged, depending on water conditions, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
