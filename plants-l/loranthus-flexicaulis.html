                    <h1>Loranthus flexicaulis</h1>
<p>Loranthus flexicaulis, commonly known as the flexible mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It primarily grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts and acacias, and derives its nutrients through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds. Its leaves are typically alternate and may be either opposite or whorled, depending on the host species.</p>
<p>Loranthus flexicaulis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in ecological interactions between plants and animals.</p>
