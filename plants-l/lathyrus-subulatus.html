<p>Lathyrus subulatus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, and it is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and trifoliate leaves. Lathyrus subulatus is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps enrich the soil.</p>
