                    <h1>Lycopodium latifolium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in woodland and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and ancient lineage make it an important study in the evolution of vascular plants.</p>
