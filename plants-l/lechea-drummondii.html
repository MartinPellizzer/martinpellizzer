                    <h1>Lechea drummondii</h1>
<p>Lechea drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in this family. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Lechea drummondii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species.</p>
