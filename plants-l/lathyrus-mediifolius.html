                    <h1>Lathyrus mediifolius</h1>
<p>Lathyrus mediifolius, commonly known as the middle-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trellises. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Lathyrus mediifolius is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
