                    <h1>Lycopodium anceps</h1>
<p>Lycopodium anceps, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte generation is dominant, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Lycopodium anceps plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
