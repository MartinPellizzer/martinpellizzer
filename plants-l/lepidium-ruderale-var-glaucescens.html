                    <h1>Lepidium ruderale var. glaucescens</h1>
<p>Lepidium ruderale var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous weed, is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy stems.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with a waxy, bluish-gray coating, giving the plant its "glaucous" appearance. This variant is native to temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>It is primarily a weed species but has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
