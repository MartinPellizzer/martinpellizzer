                    <h1>Lycium scoparium var. affine</h1>
<p>Lycium scoparium var. affine, commonly known as the silverleaf lycium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, reflective hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-orange berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and habitat restoration in desert ecosystems.</p>
