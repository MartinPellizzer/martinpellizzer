                    <h1>Lophophora koehresii</h1>
<p>Lophophora koehresii, commonly known as the Mexican peyote, is a small cacti species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, ribbed stem with a single, spiny areola at the top, which bears the characteristic yellowish, button-like flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains mescaline, a psychoactive alkaloid. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
