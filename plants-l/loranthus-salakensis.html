                    <h1>Loranthus salakensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus salakensis, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant found in the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as Rhododendron species, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
