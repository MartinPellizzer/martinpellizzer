                    <h1>Lemna rwandensis</h1>
<p>Lemna rwandensis, commonly known as the Rwandan water clover, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered in groups of three, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is native to parts of Africa, particularly Rwanda.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain aquatic environments if not managed properly.</p>
