<p>Listera ovata lusus trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leafed basket flower, is a rare variant of the basket flower species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to taxonomists and botanists.</p>
