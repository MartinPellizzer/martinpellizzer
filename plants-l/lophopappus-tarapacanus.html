<p>Lophopappus tarapacanus, commonly known as the Atacama thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile and Peru.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, adapted to the extreme conditions of the Atacama Desert. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Lophopappus tarapacanus is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand high levels of solar radiation.</p>
