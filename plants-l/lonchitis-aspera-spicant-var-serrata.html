<p>Lonchitis-aspera spicant var. serrata, commonly known as the rough spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. It is characterized by its serrated leaf margins, which contribute to its varietal name.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
