<p>Linum luteolum, commonly known as yellow flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its fibrous stalks were historically used for textile production, similar to its more well-known relative, flax.</p>
<p>Linum luteolum thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in meadows and disturbed habitats.</p>
