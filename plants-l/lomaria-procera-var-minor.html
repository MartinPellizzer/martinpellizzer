                    <h1>Lomaria procera var. minor</h1>
<p>Lomaria procera var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf lomaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, low-maintenance plants.</p>
