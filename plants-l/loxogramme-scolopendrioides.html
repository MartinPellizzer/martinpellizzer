                    <h1>Loxogramme scolopendrioides</h1>
<p>Loxogramme scolopendrioides, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, forming dense mats that can help stabilize sediments.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided and have a distinctive, almost worm-like appearance, which contributes to its common name.</p>
