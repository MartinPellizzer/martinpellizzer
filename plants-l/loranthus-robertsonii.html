                    <h1>Loranthus robertsonii</h1>
<p>Loranthus robertsonii, commonly known as the Robertson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree for nutrients and water.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature means it derives a significant portion of its sustenance from the host tree, though it can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological role, it is sometimes considered a keystone species in its native habitats.</p>
