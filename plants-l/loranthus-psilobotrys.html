                    <h1>Loranthus psilobotrys</h1>
<p>Loranthus psilobotrys, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's tissue. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries are orange-red and contain sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
