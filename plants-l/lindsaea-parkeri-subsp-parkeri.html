<p>Lindsaea parkeri subsp.</p>
<p>parkeri, commonly known as the Parker's lindsaea, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish to blackish hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
