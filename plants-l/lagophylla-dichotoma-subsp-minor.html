<p>Lagophylla dichotoma subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as the slender leafed rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on sand dunes or in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is an important component of the local flora in its native range.</p>
