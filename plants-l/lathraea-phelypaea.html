                    <h1>Lathraea phelypaea</h1>
<p>Lathraea phelypaea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Lathraea phelypaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
