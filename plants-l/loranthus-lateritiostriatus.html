                    <h1>Loranthus lateritiostriatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus lateritiostriatus, commonly known as the laterite-striated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates a healthy ecosystem, as it relies on specific host species for survival.</p>
