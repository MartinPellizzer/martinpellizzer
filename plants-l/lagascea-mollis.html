<p>Lagascea mollis, commonly known as the softleaf lagascea, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has a sprawling growth habit with soft, hairy stems. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a woolly texture that helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
