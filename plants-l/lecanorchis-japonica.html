<p>Lecanorchis japonica, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of white to pale yellow flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>Lecanorchis japonica is notable for its lack of a visible stem and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
