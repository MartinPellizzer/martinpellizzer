                    <h1>Liparis oxyphylla</h1>
<p>Liparis oxyphylla, commonly known as the sharp-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found growing on rocks or in shaded forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
