                    <h1>Lellingeria oreophila</h1>
<p>Lellingeria oreophila, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lellingeria oreophila is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
