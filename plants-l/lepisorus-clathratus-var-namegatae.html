<p>Lepisorus clathratus var. namegatae, commonly known as the Namegata fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The fronds are typically lanceolate or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
