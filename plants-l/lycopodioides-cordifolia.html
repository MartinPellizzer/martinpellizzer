<p>Lycopodioides cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stem. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Lycopodioides cordifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
