                    <h1>Lithophragma</h1>
<p>Lithophragma, commonly known as the evergreen saxifrage, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to western North America, particularly in regions with moist, shaded environments. They are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in spring. Lithophragma species are often found in forest understories and rocky areas, thriving in cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them popular in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
