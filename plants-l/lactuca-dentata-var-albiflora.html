                    <h1>Lactuca dentata var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Lactuca dentata var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered prickly lettuce, is a variant of the prickly lettuce species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its serrated, lobed leaves and distinctive white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a hairy stem and is known for its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of lactucin and other sesquiterpene lactones.</p>
<p>This variant is less commonly cultivated than its green-leafed relatives but is occasionally grown as a wild plant or for ornamental purposes.</p>
