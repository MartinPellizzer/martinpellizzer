                    <h1>Leymus chinensis var. pumilus</h1>
<p>Leymus chinensis var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that are well adapted to harsh environmental conditions such as cold climates and poor soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in steppe and grassland ecosystems, playing a significant role in soil stabilization and habitat provision.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
