<p>Lepismium miyagawae, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite species of orchid native to Japan.</p>

The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
