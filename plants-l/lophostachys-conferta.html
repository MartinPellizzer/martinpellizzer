<p>Lophostachys conferta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its deep taproot system allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions by accessing underground water sources.</p>
<p>Lophostachys conferta is also known for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in disturbed desert environments.</p>
