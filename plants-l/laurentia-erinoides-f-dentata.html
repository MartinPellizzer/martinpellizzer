<p>Laurentia erinoides f. dentata, commonly known as the toothed laurentia, is a compact, low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive, toothed margin on its leaves, which gives it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in maritime gardens and as a coastal hedging plant.</p>
