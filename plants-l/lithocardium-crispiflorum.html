                    <h1>Lithocardium crispiflorum</h1>
<p>Lithocardium crispiflorum, commonly known as the wrinkled-flower lithocardium, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lithocardium crispiflorum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
