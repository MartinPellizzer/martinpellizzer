                    <h1>Loranthus tetranthus</h1>
<p>Loranthus tetranthus, commonly known as the four-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that perform photosynthesis. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
