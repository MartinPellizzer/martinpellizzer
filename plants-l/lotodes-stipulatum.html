<p>Lotodes stipulatum, commonly known as the stipule water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to repel water. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>The stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves, are a distinguishing feature of this species.</p>
