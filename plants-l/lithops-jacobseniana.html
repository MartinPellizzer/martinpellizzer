<p>Lithops jacobseniana, commonly known as the "living stone," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lithops jacobseniana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
