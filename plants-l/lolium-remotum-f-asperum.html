                    <h1>Lolium remotum f. asperum</h1>
<p>Lolium remotum f. asperum, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is typically dark green and has a somewhat bitter taste, making it less palatable to livestock.</p>
<p>Lolium remotum f. asperum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments.</p>
