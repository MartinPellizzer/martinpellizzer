                    <h1>Lacmellea bahiensis</h1>
<p>Lacmellea bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia brittlestar, is a species of sea star native to the Atlantic Ocean, particularly around Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Astropectinidae and is characterized by its distinctive, delicate arms that are often covered in small, spiny projections. The body of Lacmellea bahiensis is typically pale in color, with a soft, fleshy texture that allows it to blend into its rocky or sandy seabed habitat. This species plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to the benthic community and serving as prey for larger marine predators.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategies and ecological interactions are still subjects of ongoing research in marine biology.</p>
