                    <h1>Lappula parva</h1>
<p>Lappula parva, commonly known as small lappula, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, also known as the mustard family, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Lappula parva is often overlooked due to its modest size but plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability.</p>
