                    <h1>Loranthus crispulomarginatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus crispulomarginatus, commonly known as the rough-fringed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on acacia and other woody species. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
