<p>Lysipomia muscoides subsp.</p>
<p>muscoides, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a crustose lichen that forms dense, low-growing mats on rocky surfaces, typically in alpine or arctic environments.</p>
<p>The thallus is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Its structure provides insulation and moisture retention, aiding survival in extreme climates.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its pale green to yellowish coloration and lacks distinct rhizines.</p>
