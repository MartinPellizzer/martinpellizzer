                    <h1>Lophostachys sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Lophostachys sessilifolia, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular form and thick, fleshy leaves that are sessile, or attached directly to the stem. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a high tolerance for drought.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in xerophytic environments.</p>
