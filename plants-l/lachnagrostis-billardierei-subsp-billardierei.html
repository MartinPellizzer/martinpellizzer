<p>Lachnagrostis billardierei subsp.</p>
<p>billardierei, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Australia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
