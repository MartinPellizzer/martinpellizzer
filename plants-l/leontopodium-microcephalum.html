                    <h1>Leontopodium microcephalum</h1>
<p>Leontopodium microcephalum, commonly known as the dwarf edelweiss, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in harsh environments with strong winds and low temperatures. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and a popular subject in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also considered a conservation concern in some areas.</p>
