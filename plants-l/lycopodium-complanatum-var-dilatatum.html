                    <h1>Lycopodium complanatum var. dilatatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium complanatum var. dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical structures at the base of the stems. Its foliage is often dense and forms a low-growing carpet, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Lycopodium complanatum.</p>
