<p>Lankesterella costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican starfish plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants like philodendrons and peace lilies, and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typically brightly colored to attract pollinators. Lankesterella costaricensis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
