<p>Lycopodium sinuosum, commonly known as the sinuous clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves that form a mat on the forest floor. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Lycopodium sinuosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
