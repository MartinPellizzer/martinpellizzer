                    <h1>Lolium temulentum var. robustum</h1>
<p>Lolium temulentum var. robustum, commonly known as stout ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust growth habit and coarse, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and somewhat hairy, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and competitive nature.</p>
