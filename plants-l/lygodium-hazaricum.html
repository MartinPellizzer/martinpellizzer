<p>Lygodium hazaricum, commonly known as the Hazar fern, is a species of climbing fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb trees and shrubs. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Lygodium hazaricum is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
