                    <h1>Loranthus eylesii</h1>
<p>Loranthus eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, leathery leaves and white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus eylesii is native to Australia and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
