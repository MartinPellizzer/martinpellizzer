                    <h1>Loranthus tetrandrus</h1>
<p>Loranthus tetrandrus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Asia and is often associated with trees such as figs and elms.</p>
