<p>Lomariopsis latiuscula, commonly known as the broad-leaved lomariopsis, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Lomariopsis latiuscula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
