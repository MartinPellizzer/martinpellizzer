                    <h1>Lappula occultata var. heterocaryoides</h1>
<p>Lappula occultata var. heterocaryoides, commonly known as the rare desert lappula, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its distinctive bracteate inflorescences and smooth, often glabrous stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its unique seed morphology, with seeds that are elongated and slightly curved, aiding in dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
