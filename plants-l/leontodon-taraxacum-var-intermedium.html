                    <h1>Leontodon taraxacum var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Leontodon taraxacum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its intermediate features between the typical *Leontodon taraxacum* and *Leontodon alpinus*.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant with a basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears a composite flower head. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
