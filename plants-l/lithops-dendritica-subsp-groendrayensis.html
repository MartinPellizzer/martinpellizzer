<p>Lithops dendritica subsp.</p>
<p>groendrayensis, commonly known as the Groenday's ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that resemble rocks, which help it survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the winter months, adding a delicate contrast to its rocky appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Lithops genus.</p>
