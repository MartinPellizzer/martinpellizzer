<p>Launaea crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved launaea, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is deep, enabling it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Launaea crassifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
