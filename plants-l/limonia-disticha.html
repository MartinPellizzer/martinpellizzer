                    <h1>Limonia disticha</h1>
<p>Limonia disticha, commonly known as the Madagascar starfruit or star gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, star-shaped yellow fruits that resemble small citrus fruits. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible, though its tart flavor makes it more suitable for culinary use in local cuisines rather than commercial cultivation.</p>
