<p>Lycopodium mollicomum, commonly known as the velvet clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems covered in a fine, velvety coating of spores. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, club-like formations. It is typically found in temperate regions, often in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Lycopodium mollicomum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
