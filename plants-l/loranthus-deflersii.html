                    <h1>Loranthus deflersii</h1>
<p>Loranthus deflersii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its parasitic nature makes it an important ecological component in certain forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ornamental value and cultural significance in various regions.</p>
