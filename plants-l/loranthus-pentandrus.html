                    <h1>Loranthus pentandrus</h1>
<p>Loranthus pentandrus, commonly known as the five-stamen mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains sticky seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Africa and is often considered a hemiparasite with both ecological and medicinal significance.</p>
