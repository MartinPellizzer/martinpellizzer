                    <h1>Loranthus capitellatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus capitellatus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host species.</p>
