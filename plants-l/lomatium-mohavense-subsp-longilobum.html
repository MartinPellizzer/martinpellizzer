<p>Lomatium mohavense subsp.</p>
<p>longilobum, commonly known as Mohave lomatia, is a perennial herb native to the Mojave Desert region of the United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purplish hues.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, arranged in a terminal umbel, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in arid conditions by accessing deep soil moisture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it a distinctive component of desert flora.</p>
