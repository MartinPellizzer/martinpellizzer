<p>Lastrea odorata, commonly known as the sweet pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky, nectar-like substance to lure insects. The plant's botanical features include a short, erect stem and waxy, broad leaves that form the trapping structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to maintain its carnivorous adaptations.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its attractive appearance and specialized ecological role in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
