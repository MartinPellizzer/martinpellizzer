                    <h1>Loranthus petiolatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus petiolatus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in dispersal.</p>
<p>Loranthus petiolatus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
