                    <h1>Leptecophylla divaricata</h1>
<p>Leptecophylla divaricata, commonly known as the variable leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a pale to dark green thallus with distinct, lobed, and often irregularly shaped leaf-like structures. The plant's surface is covered in fine, branched hyphae that aid in nutrient absorption. It is typically found on tree trunks and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an indicator of environmental stability.</p>
