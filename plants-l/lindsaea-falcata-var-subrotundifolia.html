                    <h1>Lindsaea falcata var. subrotundifolia</h1>
<p>Lindsaea falcata var. subrotundifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and its pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds are often arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with the pinnae being lanceolate to ovate in shape. This variety is distinguished by its sub-rounded leaflets, which give it a more compact appearance compared to the typical form of L. falcata.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it grows epiphytically or on rocky surfaces.</p>
