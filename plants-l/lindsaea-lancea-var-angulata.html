<p>Lindsaea lancea var. angulata, commonly known as the angular lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its long, slender, linear leaves that often form dense, cascading fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sorus.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its sharp, angular leaf tips, which give it its common name.</p>
