                    <h1>Lepironia zeylanica</h1>
<p>Lepironia zeylanica, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Sri Lanka, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom above the water, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrates of its aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>Lepironia zeylanica plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
