                    <h1>Lasiarrhenum pinetorum</h1>
<p>Lasiarrhenum pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leaf-like thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a delicate, lobed structure. The lichen forms symbiotic associations with specific algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the environment. It is often found on bark, wood, and soil in pine-dominated ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, it is considered an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
