                    <h1>Lotus patens</h1>
<p>Lotus patens, commonly known as the water lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the muddy bottom, while its stems support the foliage above the water.</p>
<p>The lotus patens plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
