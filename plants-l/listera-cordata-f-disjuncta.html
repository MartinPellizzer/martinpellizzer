                    <h1>Listera cordata f. disjuncta</h1>
<p>Listera cordata f. disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct Heartleaf, is a rare and distinctive variant of the heartleaf (Listera cordata).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, where the heart-shaped leaves are split into two distinct lobes, giving it a disjunct appearance. This fern-like plant belongs to the Primulaceae family and is native to specific regions in North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
