<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green. It has a short rhizome and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in areas with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
