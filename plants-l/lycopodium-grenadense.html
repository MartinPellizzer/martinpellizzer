<p>Lycopodium grenadense, commonly known as the Grenada clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the island of Grenada in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium grenadense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important species for ecological and botanical studies.</p>
