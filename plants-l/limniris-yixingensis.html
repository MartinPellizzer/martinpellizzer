<p>Limniris yixingensis, commonly known as the Yixing water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Limniris yixingensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
