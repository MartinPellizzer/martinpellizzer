                    <h1>Lobelia poasensis</h1>
<p>Lobelia poasensis, commonly known as the Po√°s lobelia, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests, where it forms dense clumps. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and short stature make it well adapted to its specific ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lobelia poasensis is considered critically endangered.</p>
