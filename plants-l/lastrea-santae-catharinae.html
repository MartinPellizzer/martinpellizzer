<p>Lastrea santae-catharinae, commonly known as the Santa Catarina lastrea, is a rare succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and vibrant floral displays. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to extreme drought conditions with its thick, waxy foliage. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are usually small and clustered, often in shades of yellow or orange.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
