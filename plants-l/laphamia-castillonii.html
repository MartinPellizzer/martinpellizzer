                    <h1>Laphamia castillonii</h1>
<p>Laphamia castillonii, commonly known as the Castillon's lophophora, is a rare and unique cactus species native to a very limited geographic range in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of small, pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this rare botanical species.</p>
