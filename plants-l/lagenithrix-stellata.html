<p>Lagenithrix stellata, commonly known as the starry lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive star-shaped thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in temperate forest environments, forming a flattened, leaf-like structure. The plant's surface is covered with small, rounded lobes that give it a unique, star-like appearance. It is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Lagenithrix stellata plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
