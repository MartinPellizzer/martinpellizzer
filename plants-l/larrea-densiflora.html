                    <h1>Larrea densiflora</h1>
<p>Larrea densiflora, commonly known as greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are coated with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Larrea densiflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
