                    <h1>Lyciodes</h1>
<p>Lyciodes, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their silver or grayish foliage, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Lyciodes species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. They produce small, often bell-shaped flowers that can be white, purple, or blue in color.</p>
<p>The fruits are usually berries that contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption.</p>
