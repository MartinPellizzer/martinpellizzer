<p>Lumnitzera salvioides, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it can thrive in saline environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and dark green, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals.</p>
<p>Lumnitzera salvioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
