                    <h1>Lancisia australis</h1>
<p>Lancisia australis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its acoustic properties and has been historically used in the construction of musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
