                    <h1>Loranthus crassus</h1>
<p>Loranthus crassus, commonly known as the rough mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. It is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open forests.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
