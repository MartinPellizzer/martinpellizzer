<p>Leontopodium fangingense, commonly known as the Fanging edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs, which protects it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments, typically above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
