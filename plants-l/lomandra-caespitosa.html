                    <h1>Lomandra caespitosa</h1>
<p>Lomandra caespitosa, commonly known as the swamp lomandra, is a perennial herb native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in wetland or swampy environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it an effective ground cover in moist habitats.</p>
<p>Lomandra caespitosa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its potential use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
