                    <h1>Linum salsoloides var. crispum</h1>
<p>Linum salsoloides var. crispum, commonly known as the crinkled flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves with a distinctive crinkled or wavy margin, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly plains.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other flax species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.</p>
