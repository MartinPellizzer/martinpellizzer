<p>Laricorchis pittieri, commonly known as the pine orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as pine forests and meadows, where it benefits from the dappled light and well-drained soil. The plant has a single, slender stem that supports a cluster of elongated, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and arranged in a loose inflorescence, giving it a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Laricorchis pittieri is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with pine trees.</p>
