                    <h1>Lithodora</h1>
<p>Lithodora, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Verbenaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Lithodora species typically have opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to their ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
