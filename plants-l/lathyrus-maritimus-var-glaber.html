                    <h1>Lathyrus maritimus var. glaber</h1>
<p>Lathyrus maritimus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth sea lupin, is a perennial leguminous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, smooth texture, hence its varietal name "glaber.". It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often growing in saline or slightly alkaline conditions.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for coastal ecosystems and soil enrichment.</p>
