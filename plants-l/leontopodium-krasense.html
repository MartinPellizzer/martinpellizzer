                    <h1>Leontopodium krasense</h1>
<p>Leontopodium krasense, commonly known as the Kras edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps, particularly in regions of Italy and Austria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow inflorescence, which resembles a dandelion. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Its leaves are typically basal, with a thick, leathery texture, and the flowers bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and is a symbol of resilience in extreme conditions.</p>
