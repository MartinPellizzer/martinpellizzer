                    <h1>Loranthus menyharthii</h1>
<p>Loranthus menyharthii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant has small, white or pale green flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause stress to its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
