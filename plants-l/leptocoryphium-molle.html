<p>Leptocoryphium molle, commonly known as the soft-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
