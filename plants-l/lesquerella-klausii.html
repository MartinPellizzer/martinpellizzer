<p>Lesquerella klausii, commonly known as the Clausius lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lesquerella klausii produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
