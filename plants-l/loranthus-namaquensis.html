                    <h1>Loranthus namaquensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus namaquensis, commonly known as the Namaqua mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily proteas, through a specialized structure called a haustellum. The plant lacks true roots and relies on its host for water and nutrients. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of potential host trees.</p>
