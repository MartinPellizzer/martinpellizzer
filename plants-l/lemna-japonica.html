                    <h1>Lemna japonica</h1>
<p>Lemna japonica, commonly known as Japanese watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in diameter, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water bodies. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its fast growth rate, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
