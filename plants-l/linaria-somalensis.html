<p>Linaria somalensis, commonly known as the Somali toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and vibrant yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. Linaria somalensis is adapted to drought conditions, with small leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
