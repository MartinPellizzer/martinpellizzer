                    <h1>Legnea</h1>
<p>Legnea, commonly known as the legume plant, is a diverse group of flowering plants belonging to the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their pod-like fruits, which contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous membrane. Many legumes have nitrogen-fixing capabilities due to symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in their root nodules. They are often found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, forests, and deserts.</p>
<p>Legumes play an important role in agriculture and ecology due to their ability to improve soil fertility.</p>
