<p>Lappula arida subsp.</p>
<p>cusickii, commonly known as the desert lappula, is a low-growing, annual herb native to arid regions of North America. It typically features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves adapted to conserve water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by bead-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of arid environments.</p>
