<p>Leptochilus metallicus, commonly known as the metallic liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright green, often metallic-sheened leaves. Its structure consists of tightly packed, overlapping leaves that help retain moisture, a crucial adaptation for its often arid habitats.</p>
<p>Leptochilus metallicus is well adapted to withstand environmental stress, making it a resilient component of many temperate ecosystems.</p>
