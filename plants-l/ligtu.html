                    <h1>Ligtu</h1>
<p>Ligtu, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where its broad, floating leaves can capture sunlight. The plant's most distinctive feature is its large, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and yellow. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Ligtu has been culturally and spiritually significant in many Asian civilizations for centuries.</p>
