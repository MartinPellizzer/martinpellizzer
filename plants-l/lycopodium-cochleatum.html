<p>Lycopodium cochleatum, commonly known as the club moss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and its ability to produce spores rather than seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage is the dominant phase in its life cycle, and it produces cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores.</p>
<p>Lycopodium cochleatum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
