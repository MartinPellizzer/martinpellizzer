                    <h1>Leymus petraeus</h1>
<p>Leymus petraeus, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Leymus petraeus is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in rocky or gravelly habitats due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native environments.</p>
