                    <h1>Lacinaria squarrosa var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Lacinaria squarrosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, woolly thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate forest environments. The plant has a pale to dark green or brownish upper surface with a distinctive, fuzzy texture. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are embedded in the thallus and aid in dispersal.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is an indicator of clean air due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
