                    <h1>Lasiodiscus palustris</h1>
<p>Lasiodiscus palustris, commonly known as the marsh disc lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its unique thallus structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on damp, shaded surfaces such as soil, rocks, or tree trunks in moist environments. The plant has a crustose or foliose growth form, with a dark, often blackish or brownish upper surface. Its reproductive structures include apothecia that are usually small and disc-shaped, with a distinct margin.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator of relatively undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>
