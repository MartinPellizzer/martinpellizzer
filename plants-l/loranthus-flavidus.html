                    <h1>Loranthus flavidus</h1>
<p>Loranthus flavidus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are small and red, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions and is considered an important part of the ecosystem for both its host trees and wildlife.</p>
