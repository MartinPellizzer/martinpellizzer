                    <h1>Lolium perenne var. pacyi</h1>
<p>Lolium perenne var. pacyi, commonly known as the Pacific perennial ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. This variety is well adapted to moist, temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in turfgrass applications due to its rapid establishment and wear tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it is less cold-hardy compared to other ryegrass varieties, limiting its use in colder regions.</p>
