                    <h1>Lycopodiella alopecuroides var. tupiana</h1>
<p>Lycopodiella alopecuroides var. tupiana, commonly known as the Tupian lycopod, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as temperate rainforests and mountainous regions. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are borne on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its morphological distinctiveness and ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
