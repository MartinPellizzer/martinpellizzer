                    <h1>Lepironia enodis</h1>
<p>Lepironia enodis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly, translucent bloom. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, elongated shape that sets it apart from other orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lepironia enodis is considered endangered and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
