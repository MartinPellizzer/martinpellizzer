                    <h1>Linaria genistifolia var. subrepens</h1>
<p>Linaria genistifolia var. subrepens, commonly known as creeping flaxflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive spurred structure, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped, with a hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
