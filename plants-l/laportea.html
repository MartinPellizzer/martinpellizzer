<p>Laportea, commonly known as the "false holly," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas, particularly the Caribbean and Central America. The plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs with opposite, often hairy leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape. They produce small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in clusters, and their fruits are achene-like, often with pappus structures for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Laportea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
