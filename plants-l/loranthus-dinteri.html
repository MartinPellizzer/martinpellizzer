                    <h1>Loranthus dinteri</h1>
<p>Loranthus dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host trees, primarily from the genus Acacia, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are small and fleshy, often containing one to three seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, Loranthus dinteri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
