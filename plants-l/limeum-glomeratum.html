<p>Limeum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, clustered growths on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces, often in temperate regions. The thallus is typically greenish to yellowish, with a smooth, leathery texture. It lacks true leaves but has a complex structure of upper and lower cortex layers.</p>
<p>Limeum glomeratum plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in forest ecosystems.</p>
