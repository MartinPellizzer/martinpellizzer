<p>Loeseneriella rowlandii, commonly known as the Rowland's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
