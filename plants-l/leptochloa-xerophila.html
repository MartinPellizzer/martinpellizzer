                    <h1>Leptochloa xerophila</h1>
<p>Leptochloa xerophila, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Leptochloa xerophila is often found in sandy soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
