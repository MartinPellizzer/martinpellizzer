<p>Lobelia seguinii f. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled lobelia, is a rare and unique variant of the lobelia genus native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>

Its flowers are usually blue or purple, with five petals and prominent, elongated sepals that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
