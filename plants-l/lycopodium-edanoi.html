<p>Lycopodium edanoi, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in strobila, or cone-like formations.
