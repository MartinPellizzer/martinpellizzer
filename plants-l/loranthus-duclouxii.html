                    <h1>Loranthus duclouxii</h1>
<p>Loranthus duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a fleshy capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Madagascar and is an example of the unique ecological relationships found in tropical ecosystems.</p>
