                    <h1>Larrea gladiata</h1>
<p>Larrea gladiata, commonly known as devil's claw, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers and small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Larrea gladiata is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used by indigenous peoples for various therapeutic purposes.</p>
