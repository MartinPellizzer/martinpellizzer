                    <h1>Lachemilla uniflora</h1>
<p>Lachemilla uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces a single, showy pink or purple flower at the center of each rosette, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Lachemilla uniflora is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
