                    <h1>Livistona rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Livistona rotundifolia, commonly known as the Round-leafed Paddle Palm, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are rounded at the tips. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
