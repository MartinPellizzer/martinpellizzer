<p>Lasiochlamys mandjeliana, commonly known as the Mandjeli's lichen, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure and a distinctive coloration that ranges from pale yellow to orange. This lichen typically grows on bark and rock surfaces in humid, shaded environments, often in montane regions. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites, which contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for certain forest ecosystems.</p>
