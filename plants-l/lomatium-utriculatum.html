<p>Lomatium utriculatum, commonly known as the bladder lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves and a tall, branching stem that produces small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its unique feature is the presence of bladder-like structures on its stems, which are thought to aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Lomatium utriculatum is also known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
