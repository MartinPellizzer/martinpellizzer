                    <h1>Lotus oligoceratos</h1>
<p>Lotus oligoceratos, commonly known as the narrow-lobed water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it in the mud at the bottom of the water body.</p>
<p>Lotus oligoceratos plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
