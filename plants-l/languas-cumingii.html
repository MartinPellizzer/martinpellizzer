<p>Languas cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's lanugo, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, which help retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Languas cumingii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
