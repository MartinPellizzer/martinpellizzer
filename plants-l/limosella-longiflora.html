<p>Limosella longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered sandplant, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and salt marshes. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Limosella longiflora plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and maintaining coastal ecosystems.</p>
