                    <h1>Loranthus obmunitus</h1>
<p>Loranthus obmunitus, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is considered a rare and ecologically significant component of its ecosystem.</p>
