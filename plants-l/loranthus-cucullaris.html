                    <h1>Loranthus cucullaris</h1>
<p>Loranthus cucullaris, commonly known as the hooded mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, typically the maple.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's leaves are small, oval, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a distinctive hood-like structure covering the base of the leaves. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses its seeds through bird droppings, aiding in its propagation.</p>
