                    <h1>Lithospermum setosum</h1>
<p>Lithospermum setosum, commonly known as the hairy lithosperm, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Lithospermum setosum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
