<p>Lyonia nipensis subsp.</p>
<p>depressinerva, commonly known as the dwarf lyonia, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Japan. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, blue-black berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
