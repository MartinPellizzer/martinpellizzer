                            <h1>Lobelia Circaeoides</h1>
<p>Lobelia circaeoides is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family known for its vibrant blue to purple flowers. Native to the southeastern United States, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments like woodland floors and stream banks. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a favorite among botanists and gardeners alike. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and role in supporting local pollinators. Despite its beauty, Lobelia circaeoides faces threats from habitat loss and overcollection.</p>
