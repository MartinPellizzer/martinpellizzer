                    <h1>Leucosedum</h1>
<p>Leucosedum, commonly known as snow-in-summer, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, giving the plant its common name. They are typically low-growing, mat-forming plants that thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. Leucosedum species are often used in rock gardens and as ground covers due to their hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The foliage is usually evergreen, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help the plant retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
