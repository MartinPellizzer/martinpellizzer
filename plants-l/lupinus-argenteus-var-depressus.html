                    <h1>Lupinus argenteus var. depressus</h1>
<p>Lupinus argenteus var. depressus, commonly known as silver lupine or silver bush lupine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces spindly, upright clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility in ecological restoration projects.</p>
