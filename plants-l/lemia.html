                    <h1>Lemia</h1>
<p>Lemia, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, reflective hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Lemia thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires high humidity and indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying properties.</p>
