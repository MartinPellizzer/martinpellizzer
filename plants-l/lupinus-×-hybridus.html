                    <h1>Lupinus × hybridus</h1>
<p>Lupinus × hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between various species of lupines, which gives it a wide range of morphological variations. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually blue, purple, or white, and they appear in dense spikes during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Lupinus × hybridus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
