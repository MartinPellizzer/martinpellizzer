                    <h1>Loranthus lugardii</h1>
<p>Loranthus lugardii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native African habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife.</p>
