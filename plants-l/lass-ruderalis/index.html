                            <h1>Lass Ruderalis</h1>
<p>Ruderalis cannabis, scientifically known as Lass ruderalis, is a unique strain of cannabis that thrives in harsh environments. Unlike its more commonly cultivated counterparts, it does not rely on human intervention for flowering. This resilient plant is native to regions with extreme climates, such as Siberia and Central Asia. Its natural adaptability has made it a subject of interest for breeders and researchers alike. With its distinct traits, Ruderalis cannabis offers potential for future cannabis cultivation and genetic studies.</p>
