<p>Linum alpinum var. obtusatum, commonly known as the Alpine flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This variety is a member of the Linaceae family and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species.</p>
