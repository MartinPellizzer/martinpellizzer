                    <h1>Lacunaria coriacea</h1>
<p>Lacunaria coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved lacunaria, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Lacunaria coriacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
