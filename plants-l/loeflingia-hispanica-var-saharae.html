                    <h1>Loeflingia hispanica var. saharae</h1>
<p>Loeflingia hispanica var. saharae, commonly known as the Saharan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens with limited water resources.</p>
