                    <h1>Lepanthopsis comet-halleyi</h1>
<p>Lepanthopsis comet-halleyi, commonly known as the Halley's comet orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellowish lip, which are adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its challenging environment. It blooms during the dry season, a rare trait among orchids, and is pollinated by specific species of bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its limited distribution, Lepanthopsis comet-halleyi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
