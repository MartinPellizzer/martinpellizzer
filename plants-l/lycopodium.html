                    <h1>Lycopodium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium, commonly known as club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and the presence of sporangia that produce spores for reproduction. Lycopodium species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant's structure includes a stem with whorls of leaves and a root system that anchors it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Despite its ancient lineage, some species of Lycopodium are used in traditional medicine and as a source of compounds with potential pharmaceutical applications.</p>
