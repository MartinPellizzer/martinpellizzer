                    <h1>Laelia × amanda</h1>
<p>Laelia × amanda, commonly known as the Amanda orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Laelia purpurata and Laelia anceola.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in drier conditions. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous showy flowers that are typically white or light pink, often with a subtle fragrance. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media, making it a popular choice for intermediate orchid growers.</p>
<p>Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen and contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
