<p>Lepisorus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved forest moss, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, clustered fronds with small, narrow leaves that are densely packed. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Lepisorus microphyllus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
