The vegetative body of Loricalepis is typically rich in secondary metabolites, contributing to its chemical complexity. It thrives in temperate and boreal climates, often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality.</p>
