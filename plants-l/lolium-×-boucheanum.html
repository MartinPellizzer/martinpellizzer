                    <h1>Lolium × boucheanum</h1>
<p>Lolium × boucheanum, commonly known as the hybrid ryegrass, is a sterile, diploid grass species resulting from the cross between Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Lolium multiflorum (Italian ryegrass).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, dark green foliage, which are typical of the Lolium genus. This plant is primarily cultivated as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value and rapid growth rate. However, it is not typically used for seed production because of its sterility.</p>
<p>Lolium × boucheanum is often used in agricultural settings to improve pasture quality and soil structure.</p>
