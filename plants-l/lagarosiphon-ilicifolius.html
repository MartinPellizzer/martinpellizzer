<p>Lagarosiphon ilicifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Hydrocharitaceae family and typically grows in freshwater habitats such as lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that appear in clusters.
