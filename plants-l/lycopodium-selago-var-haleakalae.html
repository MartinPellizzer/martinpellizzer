                    <h1>Lycopodium selago var. haleakalae</h1>
<p>Lycopodium selago var. haleakalae, commonly known as the HaleakalƒÅ clubmoss, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that give it a clubmoss appearance. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
