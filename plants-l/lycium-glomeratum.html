<p>Lycium glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered goji or Chinese boxthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Lycium glomeratum thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age.</p>
