<p>Lagophylla dichotoma, commonly known as the mountain tea plant, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching structure and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control in challenging landscapes.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
