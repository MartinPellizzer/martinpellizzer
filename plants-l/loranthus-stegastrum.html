                    <h1>Loranthus stegastrum</h1>
<p>Loranthus stegastrum, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own nutrients through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red, fleshy, and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus stegastrum plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
