<p>Lunathyrium, commonly known as the moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its night-blooming white flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its botanical name reflects its association with the moon, as its flowers open only under moonlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and delicate nature, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region.</p>
