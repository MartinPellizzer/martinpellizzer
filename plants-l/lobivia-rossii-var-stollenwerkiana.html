                    <h1>Lobivia rossii var. stollenwerkiana</h1>
<p>Lobivia rossii var. stollenwerkiana, commonly known as the Stollenwerk's lobivia, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the Atacama Desert of Chile.</p>
<p>This succulent features short, cylindrical stems with bright green, ribbed bodies that can develop a reddish tinge when exposed to full sun. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from areoles along the stem, and are often tubular in shape. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
