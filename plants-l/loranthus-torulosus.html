                    <h1>Loranthus torulosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus torulosus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily from the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through partial photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature can weaken the host tree over time, though it plays a role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Loranthus torulosus is native to regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
