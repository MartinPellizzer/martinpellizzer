<p>Limnophila trifida, commonly known as the water starwort, is a aquatic plant belonging to the Pontederiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Limnophila trifida is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
