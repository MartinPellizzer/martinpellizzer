                    <h1>Larix communis</h1>
<p>Larix communis, commonly known as the European larch, is a deciduous conifer native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden and fall off in autumn, distinguishing it from most other conifers. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>The European larch is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities.</p>
