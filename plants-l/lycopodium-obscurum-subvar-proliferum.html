<p>Lycopodium obscurum subvar. proliferum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant forms compact, cushion-like growths and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its structure is reminiscent of ancient plant forms.</p>
<p>This subvariety is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its resilience to environmental stress.</p>
