<p>Loxogramme africana, commonly known as the African water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the water surface. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Loxogramme africana plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
