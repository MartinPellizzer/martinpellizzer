                    <h1>Loranthus contractus</h1>
<p>Loranthus contractus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and plays a significant role in the ecosystem as both a parasite and a food source for various animals.</p>
