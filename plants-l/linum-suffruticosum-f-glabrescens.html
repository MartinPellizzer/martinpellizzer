                    <h1>Linum suffruticosum f. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Linum suffruticosum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous flax, is a botanical variant of the flax plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential for horticultural use.</p>
