<p>Lophophora pentagona, commonly known as the peyote cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, rounded stem and the presence of clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is known for containing the psychoactive alkaloid mescaline, which has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples. It thrives in arid conditions with well-drained soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its cultural and legal significance, it is often protected in its native habitat.</p>
