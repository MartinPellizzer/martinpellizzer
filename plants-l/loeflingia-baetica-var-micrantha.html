<p>Loeflingia baetica var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered loeflingia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are usually a pale pink or white color. It thrives in rocky or limestone-rich soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
