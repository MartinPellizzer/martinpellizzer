                    <h1>Lycopodium subtrifoliatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium subtrifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, carpet-like growths on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodium subtrifoliatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
