<p>Lastrea squamigera, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters at the base of the stems, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Lastrea squamigera is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
