<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a compact, low-growing habit.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its native habitat.</p>
