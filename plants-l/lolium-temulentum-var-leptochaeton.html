                    <h1>Lolium temulentum var. leptochaeton</h1>
<p>Lolium temulentum var. leptochaeton, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
