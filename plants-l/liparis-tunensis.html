<p>Liparis tunensis, commonly known as the Tunisian lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a slender, creeping stem with numerous small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
