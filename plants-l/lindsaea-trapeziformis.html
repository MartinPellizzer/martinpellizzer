<p>Lindsaea trapeziformis, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a complex root system adapted for nutrient absorption from the air and rain. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Lindsaea trapeziformis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
