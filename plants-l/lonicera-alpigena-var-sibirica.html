<p>Lonicera alpigena var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The berries that follow the flowers are red and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed as those of other honeysuckle species.</p>
