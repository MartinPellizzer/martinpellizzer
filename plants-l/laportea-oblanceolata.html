                    <h1>Laportea oblanceolata</h1>
<p>Laportea oblanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, purple to pink flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage has a distinctive, slightly aromatic scent when crushed, which is due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones.</p>
<p>Laportea oblanceolata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade.</p>
