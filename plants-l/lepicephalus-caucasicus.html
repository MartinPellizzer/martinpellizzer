<p>Lepicephalus caucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian lepicephalus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink, and are arranged in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
