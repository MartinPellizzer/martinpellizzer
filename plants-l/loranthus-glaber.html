                    <h1>Loranthus glaber</h1>
<p>Loranthus glaber, commonly known as the smooth mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Loranthus glaber plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, despite its parasitic nature.</p>
