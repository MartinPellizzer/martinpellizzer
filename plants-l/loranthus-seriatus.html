                    <h1>Loranthus seriatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus seriatus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or greenish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus seriatus is found in various regions of the world, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
