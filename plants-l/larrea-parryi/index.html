                            <h1>Larrea Parryi</h1>
<p>Larrea parryi, commonly known as greasewood, is a hardy shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in harsh desert environments where water is scarce and temperatures can be extreme. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Despite its tough appearance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife. Its resilience makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
