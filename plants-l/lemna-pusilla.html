                    <h1>Lemna pusilla</h1>
<p>Lemna pusilla, commonly known as the lesser watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Lemna pusilla reproduces both sexually and asexually, with the latter being the primary method through the production of tiny, buoyant propagules.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
