<p>Lycopodium obscurum f. dendroideum, commonly known as the clubmoss fern, is a unique variant of the common clubmoss.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a creeping stem with clusters of spore-bearing leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. Its foliage is dense and contributes to the formation of a low, carpet-like ground cover.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by its more upright growth compared to the typical prostrate form of the species.</p>
