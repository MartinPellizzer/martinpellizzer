                    <h1>Limonium popovii</h1>
<p>Limonium popovii, commonly known as the Crimean sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Limonium popovii is well adapted to salty air and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant often found in coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
