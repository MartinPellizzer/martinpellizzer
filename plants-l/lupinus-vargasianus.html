<p>Lupinus vargasianus, commonly known as the Vargasian lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several angular seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in dry climates.</p>
<p>Lupinus vargasianus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
