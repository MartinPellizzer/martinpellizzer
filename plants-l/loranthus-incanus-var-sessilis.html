                    <h1>Loranthus incanus var. sessilis</h1>
<p>Loranthus incanus var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its haustoria to absorb water and nutrients from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its flowers are usually inconspicuous, with a single stamen and two stigmas.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its sessile (short-stemmed) leaves, which distinguish it from other Loranthus species.</p>
