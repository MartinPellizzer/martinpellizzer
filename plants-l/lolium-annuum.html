                    <h1>Lolium annuum</h1>
<p>Lolium annuum, commonly known as annual ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which develop into seeds. Annual ryegrass is often used in forage and turfgrass applications due to its rapid growth and high nutritional value.</p>
<p>It is also an important weed in agricultural fields, particularly in crops like corn and soybeans.</p>
