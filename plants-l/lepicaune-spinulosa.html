                    <h1>Lepicaune spinulosa</h1>
<p>Lepicaune spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny lepicaune, is a unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth form with woody stems covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Lepicaune spinulosa is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
