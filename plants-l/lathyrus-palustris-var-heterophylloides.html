<p>Lathyrus palustris var. heterophylloides, commonly known as the marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are typically alternate, with varying leaflet shapes depending on the plant's growth conditions, a trait known as heterophyllous variation. Its flowers are borne in racemes and are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
