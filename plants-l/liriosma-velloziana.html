<p>Liriosma velloziana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or creeping liriosma, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by triangular, three-lobed berries.</p>
<p>Liriosma velloziana is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
