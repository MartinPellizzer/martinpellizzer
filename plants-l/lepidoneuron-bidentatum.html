<p>Lepidoneuron bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a unique arrangement of pinnae and small, tooth-like projections.
