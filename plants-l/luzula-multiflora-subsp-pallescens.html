<p>Luzula multiflora subsp.</p>
<p>pallescens, commonly known as the pale leaching sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a bluish-green color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost grayish appearance, which helps it blend into its natural habitat.</p>
