                    <h1>Loranthus gracilifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus gracilifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found on hosts such as fig trees and mangoes.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host plant, making it an important ecological factor in forest ecosystems.</p>
