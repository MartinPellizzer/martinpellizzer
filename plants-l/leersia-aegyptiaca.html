                    <h1>Leersia aegyptiaca</h1>
<p>Leersia aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Leersia aegyptiaca is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
