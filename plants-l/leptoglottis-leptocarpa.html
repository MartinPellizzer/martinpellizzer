                    <h1>Leptoglottis leptocarpa</h1>
<p>Leptoglottis leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can be beneficial for soil stabilization.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
