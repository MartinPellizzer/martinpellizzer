                    <h1>Lopezia suffrutescens</h1>
<p>Lopezia suffrutescens, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with woody stems that become more branched and sprawling with age. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Lopezia suffrutescens is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
