                    <h1>Lophotocarpus calycinus f. fluitans</h1>
<p>Lophotocarpus calycinus f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating water fern, is a unique variant of the water fern species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that drift on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with ample sunlight, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its fronds are typically light green and have a waxy coating that helps them remain buoyant.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to purify water naturally.</p>
