                    <h1>Loranthus cordilimbus</h1>
<p>Loranthus cordilimbus, commonly known as the heart-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or greenish in color. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus cordilimbus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
