<p>Lepisorus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elliptical fronds that are often submerged in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshy areas, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged vegetation. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Lepisorus ellipticus plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
