                    <h1>Leochilus diaphanus</h1>
<p>Leochilus diaphanus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its unique appearance and limited habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
