<p>Lycopodium carolinum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of scale-like leaves that form a low, carpet-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically reddish-brown and clustered at the base of the stems. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to form dense ground cover make it an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
