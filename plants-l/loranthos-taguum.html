                    <h1>Loranthos taguum</h1>
<p>Loranthos taguum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as teak and mango.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthos taguum plays a role in the ecological balance by providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
