                    <h1>Laplacea portoricensis</h1>
<p>Laplacea portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican laplacea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in forested areas, often near streams or in limestone regions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Laplacea portoricensis is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique adaptations and ecological role.</p>
