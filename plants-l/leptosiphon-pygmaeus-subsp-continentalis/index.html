                            <h1>Leptosiphon Pygmaeus Subsp. Continentalis</h1>
<p>Little blue mistflower, scientifically known as Leptosiphon pygmaeus subsp. continentalis, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of tiny, sky-blue blossoms that appear in late summer and early fall. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and swampy areas. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and adding visual interest to natural landscapes. Its subtle beauty and ecological significance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
