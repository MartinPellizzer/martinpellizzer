<p>Leontodon taraxacum subsp.</p>
<p>laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, waxy leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets.</p>
<p>The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its smooth leaf surfaces and is often confused with other dandelion species due to its similar appearance.</p>
