<p>Lycopodium schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, which is segmented and resembles a club. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches.</p>
<p>Lycopodium schlechteri plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and habitat provision for various forest floor organisms.</p>
