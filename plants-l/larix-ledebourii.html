<p>Larix ledebourii, commonly known as the Ledebour's larch, is a species of deciduous conifer native to central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to shed its needle-like leaves in the fall. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is typically smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This hardy plant is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and is often found in alpine regions.</p>
