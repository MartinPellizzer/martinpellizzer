                    <h1>Leptochilus poilanei</h1>
<p>Leptochilus poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's leathery fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores released from specialized clusters on the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Leptochilus poilanei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
