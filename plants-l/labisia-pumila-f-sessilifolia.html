<p>Labisia pumila f. sessilifolia, commonly known as the dwarf labisia or sessile-leaved labisia, is a compact shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack petioles and are directly attached to the stem. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typical of the Rubiaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated for both horticultural and traditional uses.</p>
