The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ledebouria viscosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
