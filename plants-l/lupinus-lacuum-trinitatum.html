                    <h1>Lupinus lacuum-trinitatum</h1>
<p>Lupinus lacuum-trinitatum, commonly known as the Trinitarian lupin, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its habitat. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers, typically in shades of purple or pink, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Lupinus lacuum-trinitatum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal dunes and providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
