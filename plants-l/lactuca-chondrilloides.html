                    <h1>Lactuca chondrilloides</h1>
<p>Lactuca chondrilloides, commonly known as sand lettuce, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed areas. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a head, typical of the dandelion-like inflorescence of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>The species is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly consumed than other lettuce varieties.</p>
