                    <h1>Lemaireocereus thurberi var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Lemaireocereus thurberi var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal night bloomer, is a rare cactus species native to the coastal regions of Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
