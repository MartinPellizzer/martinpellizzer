                    <h1>Lysimachia nummulariifolia</h1>
<p>Lysimachia nummulariifolia, commonly known as golden moss or coinleaf speedwell, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, succulent leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers throughout the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shady gardens.</p>
