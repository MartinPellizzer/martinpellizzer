                    <h1>Luzula flavescens</h1>
<p>Luzula flavescens, commonly known as yellow woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features dense clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form compact, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Luzula flavescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions.</p>
