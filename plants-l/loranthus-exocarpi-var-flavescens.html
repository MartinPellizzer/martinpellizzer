                    <h1>Loranthus exocarpi var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Loranthus exocarpi var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish floral structures and hemiparasitic nature, drawing water and nutrients from its host while performing some photosynthesis. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are usually scale-like and arranged in whorls, and it thrives in temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its habitat.</p>
