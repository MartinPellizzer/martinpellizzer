<p>Labatia tovarensis, commonly known as the Tovarensis bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of La RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or limestone soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Labatia tovarensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
