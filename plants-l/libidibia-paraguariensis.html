<p>Libidibia paraguariensis, commonly known as Ayahuasca, is a woody legume native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain a single, hard seed. Its most notable feature is the presence of psychoactive alkaloids, particularly DMT, in its bark and leaves.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional shamanic rituals for its hallucinogenic effects.</p>
