                    <h1>Loranthus gibbosulus</h1>
<p>Loranthus gibbosulus, commonly known as the globe-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, globe-shaped clusters of leaves. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Africa and is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
