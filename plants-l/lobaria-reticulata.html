                    <h1>Lobaria reticulata</h1>
<p>Lobaria reticulata, commonly known as the network lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Lobariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, web-like thallus with a dark, leathery upper surface and a lighter, granular lower surface. The lichen is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments across temperate regions. It forms a symbiotic relationship with green algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its nutritional needs.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
