<p>Lycopodium taxifolium, commonly known as the fern moss or ground pine, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a branching, root-like structure called a rhizome. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of its branches.</p>
<p>Lycopodium taxifolium plays an important role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
