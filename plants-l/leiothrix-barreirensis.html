<p>Leiothrix barreirensis, commonly known as the Barreirensis fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
