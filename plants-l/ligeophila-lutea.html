                    <h1>Ligeophila lutea</h1>
<p>Ligeophila lutea, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which is composed of a complex interrelationship between fungal and algal components. The plant's structure includes a loosely branched, leaf-like body that is often covered in a thin, crusty layer. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
