<p>It is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a low-growing, succulent habit, allowing it to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Linanthastrum melingii plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
