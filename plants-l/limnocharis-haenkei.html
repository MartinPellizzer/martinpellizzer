                    <h1>Limnocharis haenkei</h1>
<p>Limnocharis haenkei, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a dense, buoyant mat on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, followed by spiny, pear-shaped fruits. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective colonizer of still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
