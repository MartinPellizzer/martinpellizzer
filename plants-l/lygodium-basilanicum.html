<p>Lygodium basilanicum, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble small, feathered leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, tropical environments, often near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are subterranean, allowing it to spread and establish dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green color and a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
