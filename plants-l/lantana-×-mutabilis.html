                    <h1>Lantana × mutabilis</h1>
<p>Lantana × mutabilis, commonly known as the everlasting lantana, is a hybrid shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that change color from white to yellow to orange to red as they age. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
