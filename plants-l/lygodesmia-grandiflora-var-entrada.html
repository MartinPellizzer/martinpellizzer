<p>It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It is native to parts of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru.</p>
<p>Its presence can affect the health of the host tree, making it an ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
