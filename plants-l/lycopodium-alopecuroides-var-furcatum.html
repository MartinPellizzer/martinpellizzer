<p>Lycopodium alopecuroides var. furcatum, commonly known as the forked clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
