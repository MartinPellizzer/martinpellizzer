<p>Luzula spicata subsp.</p>
<p>brevispicata, commonly known as the slender spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, often in wet or semi-wet soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of *Luzula spicata*.</p>
