<p>Lacostea zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Lacostea zollingeri is considered threatened, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
