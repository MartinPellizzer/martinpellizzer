<p>Lilium carniolicum subsp.</p>
<p>jankae, commonly known as the Janka's fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear large, showy white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive frilled edge.</p>
<p>The plant's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
