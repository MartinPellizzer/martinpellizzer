<p>Lychnophora bahiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *pau-rosa*, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, white to pink flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, red or orange fruits containing one or two seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
