                    <h1>Lopezia fruticosa</h1>
<p>Lopezia fruticosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Lopezia fruticosa is well adapted to harsh desert climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
