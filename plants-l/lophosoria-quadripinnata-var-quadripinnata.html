                    <h1>Lophosoria quadripinnata var. quadripinnata</h1>
<p>Lophosoria quadripinnata var. quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-winged fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which aid in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
