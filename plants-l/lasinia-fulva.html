                    <h1>Lasinia fulva</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Lasi√±a fulva, commonly known as the golden lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a bright yellow to orange hue due to the presence of pigments like orcinol and atranorin. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal partner. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
