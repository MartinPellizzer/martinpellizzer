<p>Lachnocephalus, commonly known as the deathå¸½ mushroom, is a genus of fungi that includes several species with toxic properties.</p>
<p>These mushrooms are characterized by their distinctive cap, which often has a viscid, sticky surface. The fruiting bodies typically grow in decaying wood, especially in temperate regions. Some species contain hallucinogenic compounds, making them both dangerous and studied for their chemical properties.</p>
<p>Due to their toxicity, they are not considered edible and can be lethal if ingested.</p>
