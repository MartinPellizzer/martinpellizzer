<p>Lingoum rohrii, commonly known as the Rohri's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the remote highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically growing on mossy tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lingoum rohrii is considered critically endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
