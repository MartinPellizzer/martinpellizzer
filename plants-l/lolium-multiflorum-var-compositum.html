                    <h1>Lolium multiflorum var. compositum</h1>
<p>Lolium multiflorum var. compositum, commonly known as Italian ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, fine-textured leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn. It is often used in forage production due to its high nutritional value and rapid establishment.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
