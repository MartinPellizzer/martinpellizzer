                    <h1>Loranthus dregei var. taborensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus dregei var. taborensis, commonly known as the Taborensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a short, woody stem with small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in small groups. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of potential host trees.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
