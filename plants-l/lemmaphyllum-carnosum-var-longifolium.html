<p>Lemmaphyllum carnosum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved meat plant, is a unique species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, meaty leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
