                    <h1>Lindsaea lancea var. horizontalis</h1>
<p>Lindsaea lancea var. horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in a horizontal or creeping manner, allowing it to spread across the forest floor. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal.</p>
