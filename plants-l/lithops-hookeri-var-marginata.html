<p>Lithops hookeri var. marginata, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "living stone," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features two fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces a tall, branching stem with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its unique appearance mimics surrounding rocks, providing effective camouflage.</p>
<p>It requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
