<p>Lobivia pentlandii var. forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' Lobivia, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, ribbed structures that help it store water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
