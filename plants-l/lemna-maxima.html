<p>Lemna maxima, commonly known as the giant water flea, is a free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat, oval-shaped leaves that are typically 1-3 cm in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the buds on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Lemna maxima thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
