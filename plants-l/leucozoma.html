                    <h1>Leucozoma</h1>
<p>Leucozoma, commonly known as the silverleaf or silverweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive silver-colored foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. Leucozoma species are typically perennial herbs that thrive in moist, temperate climates, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as *Leucozoma calycina*, which is native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
