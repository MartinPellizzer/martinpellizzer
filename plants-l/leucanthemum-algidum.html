                    <h1>Leucanthemum algidum</h1>
<p>Leucanthemum algidum, commonly known as the alpine oxeye, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white flowers with a yellow center, resembling daisies, and is often found in rocky or grassy areas at high altitudes. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and has a compact, mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment.</p>
<p>Leucanthemum algidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions.</p>
