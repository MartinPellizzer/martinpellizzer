                    <h1>Lycianthes parasitica</h1>
<p>Lycianthes parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its fruits are typically berries that contain seeds. It is often found growing on other plants in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes problematic in agricultural settings.</p>
