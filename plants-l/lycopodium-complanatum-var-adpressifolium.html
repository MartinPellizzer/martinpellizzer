                    <h1>Lycopodium complanatum var. adpressifolium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium complanatum var. adpressifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the ground, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its slow growth and ability to form extensive carpets in suitable habitats.</p>
