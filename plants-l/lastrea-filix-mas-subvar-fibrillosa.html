                    <h1>Lastrea filix-mas subvar. fibrillosa</h1>
<p>Lastrea filix-mas subvar. fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous staghorn fern, is a variant of the staghorn fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, antler-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which contribute to its nutrient uptake. Its rhizome forms a dense, fibrous mat that anchors it to trees or rocks.</p>
<p>This subvariety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties.</p>
