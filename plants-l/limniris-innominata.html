                    <h1>Limniris innominata</h1>
<p>Limniris innominata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Limniris innominata is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
