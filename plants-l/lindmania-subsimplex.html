                    <h1>Lindmania subsimplex</h1>
<p>Lindmania subsimplex, commonly known as the small-leaved lindmania, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a terminal inflorescence. Its leaves are adapted to capture and retain moisture, which is essential for survival in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Lindmania subsimplex is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
