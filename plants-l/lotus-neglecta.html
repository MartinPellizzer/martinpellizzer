                    <h1>Lotus neglecta</h1>
<p>Lotus neglecta, commonly known as the desert lotus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that produces small, showy pink or white flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions by accessing water from deeper underground. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
