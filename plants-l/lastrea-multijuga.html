<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Lastrea multijuga is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
