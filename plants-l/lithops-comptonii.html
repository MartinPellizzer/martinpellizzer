                    <h1>Lithops comptonii</h1>
<p>Lithops comptonii, commonly known as the Cape Town stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pair of fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Lithops comptonii is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
