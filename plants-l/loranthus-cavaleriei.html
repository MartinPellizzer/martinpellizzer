                    <h1>Loranthus cavaleriei</h1>
<p>Loranthus cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to China and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
