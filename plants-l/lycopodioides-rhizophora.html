                    <h1>Lycopodioides rhizophora</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides rhizophora, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that thrive in coastal areas. The plant forms dense, low-growing colonies, often found in the intertidal zones of mangrove forests. Its rhizomes are highly发达, enabling it to anchor itself in soft, waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
