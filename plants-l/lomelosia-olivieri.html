<p>Lomelosia olivieri, commonly known as the olive tree of the Canary Islands, is a small evergreen shrub native to the volcanic soils of La Palma.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits resembling small olives. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in full sun with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
