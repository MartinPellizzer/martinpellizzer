                    <h1>Lachnagrostis filiformis var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Lachnagrostis filiformis var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in salt marshes or dunes. The plant has slender, thread-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its resilience and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions.</p>
