<p>Lappula patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian lappula, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Lappula patagonica is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems.</p>
