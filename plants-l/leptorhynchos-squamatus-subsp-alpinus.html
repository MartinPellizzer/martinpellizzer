<p>Leptorhynchos squamatus subsp.</p>
<p>alpinus, commonly known as the alpine leptorhynchos, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its compact growth form and dense, hairy foliage, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
