                    <h1>Lophothecium</h1>
<p>Lophothecium, commonly known as the cap of a moss spore capsule, is a specialized structure in certain mosses.</p>
<p>It is a cup-like, hollow, and often hairy covering that protects the spores within the sporangium. The lophothecium is composed of a single layer of cells that are tightly packed and may have specialized features such as stomata or ridges. Its primary function is to provide a controlled environment for spore release and dispersal.</p>
<p>The structure varies among different moss species and can be an important taxonomic feature.</p>
