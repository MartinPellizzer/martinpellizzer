                    <h1>Lastrea regis</h1>
<p>Lastrea regis, commonly known as the royal lastrea, is a rare and striking succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to overwatering, it requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival.</p>
