<p>Laplacea barbinervis, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are covered in soft, hairy structures. Native to tropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
