                    <h1>Lunathyrium hirtirachis</h1>
<p>Lunathyrium hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its most striking feature is its nocturnal blooming habit, with pale yellow flowers opening at night.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
