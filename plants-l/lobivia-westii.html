                    <h1>Lobivia westii</h1>
<p>Lobivia westii, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically fleshy and may be spiny, adapted to store water and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Lobivia westii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
