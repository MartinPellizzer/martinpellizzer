<p>Lepidium graminifolium var. polycladum, commonly known as the slender peppergrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that are often covered with small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a slightly rough texture due to the presence of small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
