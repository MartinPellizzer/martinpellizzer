<p>Lotus glacialis, commonly known as the glacier lotus, is a rare and hardy plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, including freezing temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological niche, it is considered an indicator species of alpine ecosystems.</p>
