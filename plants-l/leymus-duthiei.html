                <h1>Leymus duthiei</h1>
<p>Leymus duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>Leymus duthiei plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions.</p>
