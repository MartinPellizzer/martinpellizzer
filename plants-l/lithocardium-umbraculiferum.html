                    <h1>Lithocardium umbraculiferum</h1>
<p>Lithocardium umbraculiferum, commonly known as the shadowy rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in rocky, sun-exposed habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, often dark-colored flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, helping it conserve water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
