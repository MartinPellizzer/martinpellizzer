                    <h1>Laurus flava</h1>
<p>Laurus flava, commonly known as the yellow laurel, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are typically yellow to golden in color, which distinguish it from its more commonly known relative, the sweet bay laurel. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and fragrance, it is often cultivated in gardens for both aesthetic and aromatic purposes.</p>
