                    <h1>Loranthus sterculiae</h1>
<p>Loranthus sterculiae, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, scale-like leaves and white, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, which in turn help in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategies make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
