<p>Larix carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Larix carpatica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
