<p>Loxogramme salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf water cloak, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, willow-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it forms dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Its fronds are usually long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Loxogramme salicifolia plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
