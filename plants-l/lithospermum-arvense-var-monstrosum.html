<p>Lithospermum arvense var. monstrosum, commonly known as the giant redroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, containing a red, staining substance called lithospermum red.</p>
