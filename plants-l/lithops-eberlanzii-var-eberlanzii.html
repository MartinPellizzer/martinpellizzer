                    <h1>Lithops eberlanzii var. eberlanzii</h1>
<p>Lithops eberlanzii var. eberlanzii, commonly known as the "living stone," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features two closely fused, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its thick, rounded leaves, which are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Lithops eberlanzii var. eberlanzii requires well-drained soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
