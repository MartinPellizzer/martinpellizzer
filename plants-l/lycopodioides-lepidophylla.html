                    <h1>Lycopodioides lepidophylla</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides lepidophylla, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to survive extreme desiccation and can revive when exposed to moisture, a trait known as anhydrobiosis. The plant has a simple, branching structure with small, scale-like leaves that are often tightly curled when dry. It thrives in arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it can remain dormant for long periods.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sporophylls and microsporangia, are adapted to ensure the dispersal of spores in dry conditions.</p>
