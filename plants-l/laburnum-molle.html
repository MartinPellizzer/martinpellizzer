                    <h1>Laburnum molle</h1>
<p>Laburnum molle, commonly known as the weeping laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has feathery, compound leaves that turn a striking coppery red in the autumn. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release tufted seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Laburnum molle is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil.</p>
