<p>Lasiorrhiza ceterachifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and for erosion control in semi-arid areas.</p>
