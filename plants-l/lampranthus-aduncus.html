<p>Lampranthus aduncus, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
