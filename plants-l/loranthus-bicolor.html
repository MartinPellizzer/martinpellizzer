                    <h1>Loranthus bicolor</h1>
<p>Loranthus bicolor, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red, are consumed by birds that help disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Loranthus bicolor is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in forested areas.</p>
