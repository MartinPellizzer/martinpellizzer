<p>Lycium implexum, commonly known as the tangled boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red berries that are edible for humans and serve as a food source for various wildlife species. Lycium implexum is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and low rainfall conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and medicinal botany.</p>
