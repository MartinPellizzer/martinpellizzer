<p>Listera nandadeviensis, commonly known as the Nanda Devi wintergreen, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
