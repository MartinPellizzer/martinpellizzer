                    <h1>Loranthus lineatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus lineatus, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are adapted for attachment to the host. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that are often dispersed by birds. Its leaves are linear and opposite, and it is native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
