                    <h1>Loxodon</h1>
<p>Loxodon, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a unique organism that belongs to the fungal-lichen symbiotic group.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on the bark of old trees or on rock surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a fungal component that provides the main body and a photosynthetic algal partner that produces nutrients through photosynthesis. Loxodon exhibits slow growth and can live for centuries, making it a rare and ancient species.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem.</p>
