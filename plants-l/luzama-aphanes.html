<p>Luzama aphanes, commonly known as the small-leaved sandweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It has small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted for survival in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Luzama aphanes plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
