<p>Lemna minuta, commonly known as water clover, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae).</p>
<p>It has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, often appearing in clusters. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing fronds.</p>
<p>Lemna minuta is commonly found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it can form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
