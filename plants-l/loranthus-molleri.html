                    <h1>Loranthus molleri</h1>
<p>Loranthus molleri, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Canary Islands, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often overlooked. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus molleri plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
