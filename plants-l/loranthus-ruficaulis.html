                    <h1>Loranthus ruficaulis</h1>
<p>Loranthus ruficaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in forested areas where its host trees are prevalent.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes contributing to biodiversity by supporting bird populations and facilitating seed dispersal.</p>
