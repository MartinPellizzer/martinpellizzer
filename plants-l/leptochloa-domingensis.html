<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family.</p>
