<p>Leptocionium magellanicum, commonly known as the Magellanic lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus, which is typically covered in a fine, powdery layer. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
