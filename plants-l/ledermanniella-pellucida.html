                    <h1>Ledermanniella pellucida</h1>
<p>Ledermanniella pellucida, commonly known as the glassy moss, is a small, delicate moss species that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, leaf-like structures that give it a glassy appearance, hence its common name. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats and is often found on decaying wood or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are typically borne on stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Ledermanniella pellucida plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
