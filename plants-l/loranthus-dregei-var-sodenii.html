                    <h1>Loranthus dregei var. sodenii</h1>
<p>Loranthus dregei var. sodenii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family.</p>
<p>It grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, and derives its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
