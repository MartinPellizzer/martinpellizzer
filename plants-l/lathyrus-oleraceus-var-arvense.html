                    <h1>Lathyrus oleraceus var. arvense</h1>
<p>Lathyrus oleraceus var. arvense, commonly known as field vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink, which are followed by elongated, flat pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility.</p>
