<p>Lycopodioides subarborescens, commonly known as the tree clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its erect, shrub-like growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, typical of many clubmosses. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Lycopodioides subarborescens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
