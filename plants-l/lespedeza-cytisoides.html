<p>Lespedeza cytisoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils.

Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Lespedeza cytisoides is also sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent soil erosion.</p>
