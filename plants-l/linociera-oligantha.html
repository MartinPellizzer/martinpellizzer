<p>Linociera oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of its host trees, such as Ficus species, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Its leaves are small, oval, and often clustered, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Linociera oligantha plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
