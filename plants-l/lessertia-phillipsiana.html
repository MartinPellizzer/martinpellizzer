<p>Lessertia phillipsiana, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Acacia and Eucalyptus. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, fleshy berries containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lessertia phillipsiana is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
