                    <h1>Lepidococcus duckei</h1>
<p>Lepidococcus duckei, commonly known as the duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having a thallus structure composed of a single, flat, oval body. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with the latter being more common, through the production of spores or by fragmentation.</p>
<p>Lepidococcus duckei thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
