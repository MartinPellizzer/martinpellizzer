<p>Lolium arvense, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Lolium arvense is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
