                    <h1>Lysimachia paludicola</h1>
<p>Lysimachia paludicola, commonly known as swamp willow herb, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats near the water's edge, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Lysimachia paludicola is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
