                    <h1>Livistona rupicola</h1>
<p>Livistona rupicola, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a member of the cycad family (Cycadaceae) and is native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
