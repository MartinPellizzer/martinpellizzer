<p>Luffa satpatia, commonly known as the sponge gourd or loofah, is a tropical and subtropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and distinctive, fibrous fruits that mature into spongy, lightweight structures. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires full sun and well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its fruits are typically harvested when mature, and the inner fibrous material is used as a natural exfoliant in skincare products.</p>
<p>Luffa satpatia is also valued for its edible young fruits and its ability to provide shade and support for other plants in agroforestry systems.</p>
