<p>Liparis nervosa subsp.</p>
<p>granitica, commonly known as the granitic lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its clusters of pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its range.</p>
