<p>Lecanopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often brightly colored inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Lecanopteris species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They have a rhizomatous growth habit and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking floral displays.</p>
