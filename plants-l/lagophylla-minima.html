<p>Lagophylla minima, commonly known as the dwarf silver leaf, is a small, succulent shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage with narrow, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil.</p>
