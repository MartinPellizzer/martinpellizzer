<p>It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with thread-like leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with frequent fog and salt spray.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife.</p>
