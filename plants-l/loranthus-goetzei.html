                    <h1>Loranthus goetzei</h1>
<p>Loranthus goetzei, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, glossy leaves and white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus goetzei is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in ecological interactions with its host species.</p>
