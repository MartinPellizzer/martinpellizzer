                    <h1>Lysistemma</h1>
<p>Lysistemma, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Lysistemma species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some varieties growing up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it an important plant for both ecological and medicinal studies.</p>
