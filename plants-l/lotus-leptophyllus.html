<p>Lotus leptophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. The plant produces white or pink flowers that bloom above the water, often in the early morning. Its leaves are thin and delicate, which helps them remain buoyant.</p>
<p>Lotus leptophyllus is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional use in water gardens.</p>
