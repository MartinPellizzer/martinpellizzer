                    <h1>Loranthus patulus</h1>
<p>Loranthus patulus, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the hostâ€™s vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by small, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in forested areas where its host trees are abundant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host if left unchecked.</p>
