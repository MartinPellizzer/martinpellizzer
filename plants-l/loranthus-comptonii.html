                    <h1>Loranthus comptonii</h1>
<p>Loranthus comptonii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing host tree health and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Loranthus comptonii is native to sub-Saharan Africa and thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
