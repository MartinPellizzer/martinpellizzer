                            <h1>Lapsana Pulchra</h1>
<p>Lapsana pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other similar plants. This species is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and feathery leaves, making it a striking addition to gardens and natural habitats. It thrives in sunny areas with well-drained soil and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in some regions, requiring careful management to prevent overgrowth.</p>
