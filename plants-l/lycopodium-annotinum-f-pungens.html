                    <h1>Lycopodium annotinum f. pungens</h1>
<p>Lycopodium annotinum f. pungens, commonly known as the spiny clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance with small, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, moss-like look. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its spiny, serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from other forms of Lycopodium.</p>
