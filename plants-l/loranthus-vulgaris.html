                    <h1>Loranthus vulgaris</h1>
<p>Loranthus vulgaris, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This evergreen plant is often associated with holiday traditions and has cultural significance in various regions.</p>
