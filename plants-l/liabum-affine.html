<p>Liabum affine, commonly known as the slender liabum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Liabum affine is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p>
