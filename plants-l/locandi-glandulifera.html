<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, glandular structures on its stems and leaves, which may play a role in chemical defense or attraction of pollinators. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in moist, woodland habitats.</p>
