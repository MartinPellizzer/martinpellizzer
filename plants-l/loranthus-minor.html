                    <h1>Loranthus minor</h1>
<p>Loranthus minor, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Loranthus minor is also culturally significant, particularly during festive seasons in some European countries.</p>
