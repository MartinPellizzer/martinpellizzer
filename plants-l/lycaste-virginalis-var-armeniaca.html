                    <h1>Lycaste virginalis var. armeniaca</h1>
<p>Lycaste virginalis var. armeniaca, commonly known as the Armenian lycaste, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant produces a fragrant, pendulous inflorescence that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and conservation status, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
