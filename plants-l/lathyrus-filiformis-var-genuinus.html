                    <h1>Lathyrus filiformis var. genuinus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus filiformis var. genuinus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and has small, hairy pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
