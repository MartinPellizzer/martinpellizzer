<p>Lupinus dasyphyllus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, stiff leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lupinus dasyphyllus is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plant species.</p>
