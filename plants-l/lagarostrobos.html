                    <h1>Lagarostrobos</h1>
<p>Lagarostrobos, commonly known as the Tasmanian pepper tree, is a unique evergreen shrub native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures that contain oily seeds, which are used in traditional Aboriginal practices. Lagarostrobos is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and exhibits a slow growth rate, making it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
<p>Its habitat is primarily restricted to the wetter regions of Tasmania, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
