                    <h1>Lolium × schlickumii</h1>
<p>Lolium × schlickumii, commonly known as the intermediate ryegrass, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and smooth ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intermediate growth habit, combining the traits of both parent species, such as moderate height and dense foliage. The plant typically forms tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often more elongated than those of its parents. It is widely cultivated for forage in agriculture due to its high nutritional value and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>Lolium × schlickumii is also valued for its ability to establish quickly and persist in grazing systems.</p>
