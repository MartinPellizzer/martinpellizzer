<p>Lygodesmia tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to its host. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can influence the health and biodiversity of the host tree and the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
