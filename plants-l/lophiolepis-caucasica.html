                    <h1>Lophiolepis caucasica</h1>
<p>Lophiolepis caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in rocky and arid environments. It is often found on limestone substrates in mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
