                            <h1>Lithocardium Gerascanthus Var. Domingense</h1>
<p>Lithocardium gerascanthus var. domingense is a rare and striking plant native to the rocky coastal regions of the Dominican Republic. Known for its vibrant purple and red flowers, it thrives in harsh, sunny environments with minimal soil. This variant of Lithocardium is closely related to other species in the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. Its unique adaptations to coastal conditions make it a fascinating subject for botanists and plant enthusiasts. Despite its beauty, it remains poorly studied and is at risk due to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
