                    <h1>Lasiochlamys koghiensis</h1>
<p>Lasiochlamys koghiensis, commonly known as the Koghi mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name, "lasiochlamys" meaning "hairy calyx.". It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
