<p>Lilium carniolicum subsp.</p>
<p>bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian fritillary, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is a bulbous perennial plant characterized by its striking, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive red throat.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
