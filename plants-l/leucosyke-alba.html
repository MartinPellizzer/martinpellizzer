<p>Leucosyke alba, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Leucosyke alba plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for specific insect species.</p>
