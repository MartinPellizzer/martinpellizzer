                    <h1>Lepidobolus deserti</h1>
<p>Lepidobolus deserti, commonly known as the desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant's structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, allowing it to withstand extreme temperatures and limited moisture. Its growth is slow, and it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other desert organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Lepidobolus deserti is an important indicator of harsh, dry environments.</p>
