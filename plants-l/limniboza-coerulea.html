                    <h1>Limniboza coerulea</h1>
<p>Limniboza coerulea, commonly known as the sky-blue water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to certain freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically a deep blue or violet color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale blue or white, blooming in the early morning. Its roots anchor it to the muddy bottom of ponds and lakes, while its leaves provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Limniboza coerulea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
