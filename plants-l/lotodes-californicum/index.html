                            <h1>Lotodes Californicum</h1>
<p>Lotodes californicum is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Known for its small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale pink, this plant adds a subtle beauty to its environment. Due to its limited range and habitat vulnerability, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts. Despite its modest appearance, Lotodes californicum plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
