                    <h1>Loranthus ensifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus ensifolius, commonly known as the swordleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, lanceolate leaves. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds.</p>
