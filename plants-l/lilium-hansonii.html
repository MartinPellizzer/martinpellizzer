<p>Lilium hansonii, commonly known as the Hanson's lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within coniferous forests or alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a fan-like pattern, while its stem is often adorned with a few narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium hansonii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
