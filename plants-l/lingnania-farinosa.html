<p>Lingnania farinosa, commonly known as the farinose lingnania, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its scientific name "farinosa," meaning flour-like. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swampy areas with rich, moist soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
