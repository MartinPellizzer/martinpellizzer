<p>Lamprotis dianthifolia, commonly known as the pink rock orchid, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
