                    <h1>Lamprotis calycinoides</h1>
<p>Lamprotis calycinoides, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral structure, with a prominent central star-shaped lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often during the wet season, and are pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in its native ecosystems.</p>
