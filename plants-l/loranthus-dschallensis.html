                    <h1>Loranthus dschallensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus dschallensis, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It primarily inhabits the branches of coniferous and broad-leaved trees in the Himalayan region. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female clusters.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
