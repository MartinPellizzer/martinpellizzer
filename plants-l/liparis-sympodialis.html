<p>Liparis sympodialis, commonly known as the sympodial orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, where the plant grows in successive shoots rather than a single stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Liparis sympodialis make it a unique subject for both horticultural and ecological study.</p>
