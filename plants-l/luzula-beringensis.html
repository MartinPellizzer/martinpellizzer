<p>Luzula beringensis, commonly known as the Bering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, boggy environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Luzula beringensis is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-latitude ecosystems.</p>
