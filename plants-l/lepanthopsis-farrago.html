<p>Lepanthopsis farrago, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic.

<p>Lepanthopsis farrago is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in warm, humid environments.</p>
