                    <h1>Lygodium × lancetillanum</h1>
<p>Lygodium × lancetillanum, commonly known as the hybrid climbing fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Lygodium microphyllum and Lygodium japonicum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, wiry rhizomes that allow it to climb and spread rapidly through dense vegetation. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which contribute to its invasive potential in suitable habitats. Its foliage is typically dark green and leathery, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a problematic species in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
