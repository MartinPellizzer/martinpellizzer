                    <h1>Lotus ononopsis</h1>
<p>Lotus ononopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces white to pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Lotus ononopsis plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
