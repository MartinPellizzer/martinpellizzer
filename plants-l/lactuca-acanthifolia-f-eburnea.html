<p>Lactuca acanthifolia f. eburnea, commonly known as the silverleaf lettuce, is a botanical variant of the prickly lettuce species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-veined leaves that give it a distinct appearance. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering stems bear small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has limited use in culinary applications due to its bitter taste.</p>
