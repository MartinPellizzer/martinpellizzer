<p>Lygistum gracile, commonly known as the slender lygistum, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins and small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
