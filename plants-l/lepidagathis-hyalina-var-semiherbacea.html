                    <h1>Lepidagathis hyalina var. semiherbacea</h1>
<p>Lepidagathis hyalina var. semiherbacea, commonly known as the glassy lepidagathis, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are typically white or pale green, with a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its semiherbaceous nature, which means it has some woody characteristics compared to the fully herbaceous form of the species.</p>
