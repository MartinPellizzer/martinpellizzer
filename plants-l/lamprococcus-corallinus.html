<p>Lamprococcus corallinus, commonly known as the coral lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, crust-like growth with a yellowish-green to brownish coloration. The plant consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which together absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its structure provides habitat for microorganisms and contributes to soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
