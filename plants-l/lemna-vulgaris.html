                    <h1>Lemna vulgaris</h1>
<p>Lemna vulgaris, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tiny, rosette-shaped leaves that are less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Watermeal reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for aquatic animals.</p>
