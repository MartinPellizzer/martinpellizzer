                    <h1>Loranthus gardneri</h1>
<p>Loranthus gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant forms a dense, leafy growth that can cover large areas of the host's branches. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in association with eucalyptus and other broadleaf trees.</p>
<p>Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife.</p>
