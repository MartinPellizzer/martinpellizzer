<p>Lomatia polymorpha var. cinerea, commonly known as the silver lomatia, is a shrub native to Tasmania, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems are often branched and can develop a rough, bark-like texture over time.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
