<p>Limonium inarimense, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions.
