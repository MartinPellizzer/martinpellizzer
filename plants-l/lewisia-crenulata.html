                    <h1>Lewisia crenulata</h1>
<p>Lewisia crenulata, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its foliage is often covered in a white, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are adapted for pollination by insects such as bees and butterflies.</p>
