                    <h1>Leptothrix</h1>
<p>Leptothrix, commonly known as the sheath-forming bacteria, is a genus of filamentous bacteria that forms gelatinous sheaths around its cells.</p>
<p>These sheaths are composed primarily of extracellular polysaccharides and can vary in thickness and structure depending on environmental conditions. Leptothrix species are often found in freshwater environments, where they play a role in the microbial loop by facilitating the cycling of nutrients. They are also capable of oxidizing iron and manganese, contributing to the geochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological functions make them an important subject of study in microbiology and environmental science.</p>
