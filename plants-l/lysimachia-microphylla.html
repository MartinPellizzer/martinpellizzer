<p>Lysimachia microphylla, commonly known as small-leaved chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in terminal spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system and dense growth habit make it an effective ground cover in wetland restoration projects.</p>
