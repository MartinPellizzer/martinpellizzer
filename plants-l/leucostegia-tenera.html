                    <h1>Leucostegia tenera</h1>
<p>Leucostegia tenera, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations for carnivory, it plays a unique role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
