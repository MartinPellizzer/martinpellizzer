<p>Lissochilus laggiarae, commonly known as the Andean slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically a striking combination of white and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, supporting various pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>
