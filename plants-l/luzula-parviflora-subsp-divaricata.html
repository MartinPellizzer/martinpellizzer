                    <h1>Luzula parviflora subsp. divaricata</h1>
<p>Luzula parviflora subsp.</p>
<p>divaricata, commonly known as the slender wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slender stems and reduced flower bracts, setting it apart from other members of the Luzula genus.</p>
