                    <h1>Lingnania surrecta</h1>
<p>Lingnania surrecta, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden within the dense foliage, and they bloom only during the brief period of twilight. Lingnania surrecta thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
