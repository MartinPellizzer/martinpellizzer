                    <h1>Lycopodium flabelliforme</h1>
<p>Lycopodium flabelliforme, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinct, branching stem structure. The plant produces sporangia, which release spores for reproduction, a feature typical of non-seed plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage provides insights into the evolutionary history of early terrestrial plants.</p>
