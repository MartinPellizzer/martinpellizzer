                    <h1>Lobostemon verrucosus var. dregei</h1>
<p>Lobostemon verrucosus var. dregei, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful management.</p>
