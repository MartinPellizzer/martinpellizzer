                    <h1>Lathraea clandestina subvar. albiflora</h1>
<p>Lathraea clandestina subvar. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has no true roots and instead attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily those in the legume family. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
