                    <h1>Leucostegia loxoscaphoides</h1>
<p>Leucostegia loxoscaphoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in fens, bogs, and other wetland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems.</p>
