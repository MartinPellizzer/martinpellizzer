                    <h1>Loranthus tenuis</h1>
<p>Loranthus tenuis, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by supporting various insect and bird populations.</p>
