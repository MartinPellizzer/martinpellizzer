                    <h1>Loranthus pendulus var. parviflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus pendulus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Rutaceae and Fagaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in short inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
