<p>Lanugothamnus suberectifolius, commonly known as the woolly thornbrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often spiny, providing a natural defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>Lanugothamnus suberectifolius is well adapted to low rainfall and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
