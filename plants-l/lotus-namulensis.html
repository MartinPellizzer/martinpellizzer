                    <h1>Lotus namulensis</h1>
<p>Lotus namulensis, commonly known as the Namu lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, while its leaves are heart-shaped and float on the water's surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Lotus namulensis is considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>
