                    <h1>Loranthus malifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus malifolius, commonly known as the sour fig or Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are edible and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Loranthus malifolius is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on mango and other hardwood trees.</p>
