                    <h1>Lastrea hunsteiniana</h1>
<p>Lastrea hunsteiniana, commonly known as the Desert Cactus, is a species native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent stems store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
