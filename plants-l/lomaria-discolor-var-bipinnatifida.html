                    <h1>Lomaria discolor var. bipinnatifida</h1>
<p>Lomaria discolor var. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking plant characterized by its bi-pinnatifid leaves that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, which contribute to its common name and help reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by spore-bearing structures.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for humid climates.</p>
