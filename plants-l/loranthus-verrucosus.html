                    <h1>Loranthus verrucosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus verrucosus, commonly known as the rough mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain several seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus verrucosus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
