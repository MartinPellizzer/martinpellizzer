<p>Leiothrix mendesii, commonly known as the Malabar silver fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, silver-tomentose fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leiothrix mendesii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
