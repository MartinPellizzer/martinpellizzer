<p>Lysipomia crassimarginata, commonly known as the broad-margin cushion plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage, which help it survive in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water and withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Lysipomia crassimarginata is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
