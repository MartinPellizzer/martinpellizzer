                    <h1>Lethedon leratii</h1>
<p>Lethedon leratii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lethe, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, three-lobed berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lethedon leratii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is important for understanding biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
