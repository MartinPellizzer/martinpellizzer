                    <h1>Loranthus bolusii</h1>
<p>Loranthus bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions like South Africa and Lesotho. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate and scale-like, and it lacks true roots, relying entirely on its host for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by influencing host tree growth and supporting bird populations.</p>
