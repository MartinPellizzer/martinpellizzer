                    <h1>Lecythis venusta</h1>
<p>Lecythis venusta, commonly known as the golden balsa, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a woody, spiky capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>The wood of Lecythis venusta is lightweight and historically used for buoyant applications, though it is now more valued for its ecological role in rainforest ecosystems.</p>
