                    <h1>Lastrea limbosperma</h1>
<p>Lastrea limbosperma, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is edible, though often used as forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
