                    <h1>Lepidagathis riparia</h1>
<p>Lepidagathis riparia, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland and riparian habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies along riverbanks and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Lepidagathis riparia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
