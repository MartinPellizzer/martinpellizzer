                    <h1>Lafoensia densiflora var. callosa</h1>
<p>Lafoensia densiflora var. callosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved lafoensia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, flaky foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically leathery and covered in a rough, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes.</p>
