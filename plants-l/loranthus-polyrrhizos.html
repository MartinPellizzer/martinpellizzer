                    <h1>Loranthus polyrrhizos</h1>
<p>Loranthus polyrrhizos, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Tamarix.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus polyrrhizos is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
