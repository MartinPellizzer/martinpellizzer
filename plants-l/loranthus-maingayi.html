                    <h1>Loranthus maingayi</h1>
<p>Loranthus maingayi, commonly known as the Maingay's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. This species is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in the canopy of rainforests. Its small, white or greenish flowers are usually visited by insects, facilitating pollination.</p>
<p>The plant's seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries and later excrete the seeds onto suitable host trees.</p>
