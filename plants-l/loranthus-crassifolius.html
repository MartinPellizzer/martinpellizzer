                    <h1>Loranthus crassifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus crassifolius, commonly known as the thick-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia, where it often grows on species like mango, neem, and tamarind. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are usually red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for decorative purposes.</p>
