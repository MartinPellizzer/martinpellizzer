                    <h1>Loranthus alveolatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus alveolatus, commonly known as the honeycomb mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found on species like the tamarind and mango.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced leaves and a reliance on its host for survival.</p>
