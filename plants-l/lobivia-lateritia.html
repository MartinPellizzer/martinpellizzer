<p>Lobivia lateritia, commonly known as the rock lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Lobivia lateritia thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
