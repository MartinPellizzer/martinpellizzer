<p>Lotus corniculatus subsp.</p>
<p>crassifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved bird's-foot trefoil, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are broader and more robust compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
