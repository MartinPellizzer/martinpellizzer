                    <h1>Lechea juncifolia</h1>
<p>Lechea juncifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is typical of the genus, which can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Lechea juncifolia plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.</p>
