                    <h1>Loranthus duthieanus</h1>
<p>Loranthus duthieanus, commonly known as the Duthie's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important food sources for various bird species. Its hemiparasitic nature means it derives some nutrients from its host but can photosynthesize to a limited extent.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
