                    <h1>Lotus krylovii</h1>
<p>Lotus krylovii, commonly known as the Siberian lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in marshy areas or along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The Siberian lotus is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to cold climates and its potential ecological significance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
