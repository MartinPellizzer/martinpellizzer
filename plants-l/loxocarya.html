                    <h1>Loxocarya</h1>
<p>Loxocarya, commonly known as the common lichen, is a type of symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is the body of the lichen, and it lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Loxocarya plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an indicator of environmental health and stability.</p>
