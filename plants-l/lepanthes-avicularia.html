<p>Lepanthes avicularia, commonly known as the feather orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble feathers, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Lepanthes avicularia is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
