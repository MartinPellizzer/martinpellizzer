                    <h1>Limnia rosulata</h1>
<p>Limnia rosulata, commonly known as the roseleaf waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water's surface, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with three petals and three sepals, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help anchor it in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Limnia rosulata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
