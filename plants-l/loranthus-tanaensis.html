                    <h1>Loranthus tanaensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus tanaensis, commonly known as the Tana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Terminalia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Tanzania and Kenya.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are typically red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
