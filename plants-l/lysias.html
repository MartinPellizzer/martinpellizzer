                    <h1>Lysias</h1>
<p>Lysias, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Asclepias and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from pink to orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Lysias plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing both nectar and a host for their larvae.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance makes it a valuable plant in native gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
