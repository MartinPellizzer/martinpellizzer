<p>Lepidium squamatum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Lepidium squamatum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes.</p>
