                    <h1>Lithops hillii</h1>
<p>Lithops hillii, commonly known as the Cape Town Lithops, is a member of the Aizoaceae family and is native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, a feature that helps it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Lithops hillii is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
