                    <h1>Lycium subglabrum</h1>
<p>Lycium subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for humans and animals, though they are often consumed by birds. Lycium subglabrum is adapted to harsh environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
