<p>Lepanthopsis lilliputalis, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its small size, often less than 10 cm in height, makes it a popular choice for terrariums and miniature gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
