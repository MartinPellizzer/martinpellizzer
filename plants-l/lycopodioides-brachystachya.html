<p>Lycopodioides brachystachya, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with closely clustered, scale-like leaves that form a dense mat. Its reproductive structures, known as strobili, are small and cone-like, containing the sporangia that produce spores.</p>
<p>Lycopodioides brachystachya plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
