                    <h1>Lyperia fruticosa</h1>
<p>Lyperia fruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically has small, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Lyperia fruticosa is considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
