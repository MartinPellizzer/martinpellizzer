                    <h1>Lophothele</h1>
<p>Lophothele, commonly known as the lacecap lichen, is a type of crustose lichen that forms a thin, flat growth on rocks or tree bark.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, web-like patterns of fungal hyphae that create a distinctive lace-like appearance. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium or green alga, which provides nutrients through photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
