                    <h1>Lolium compressum</h1>
<p>Lolium compressum, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, flat leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and adaptability, it is both a desirable ornamental grass and a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
