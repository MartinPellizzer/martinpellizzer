<p>Lithophragma tenellum var. thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, a characteristic adaptation to its rocky, well-drained habitats. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats, making it a useful plant for erosion control in suitable environments.</p>
