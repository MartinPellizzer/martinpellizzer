                    <h1>Lichenora jerdoniana</h1>
<p>Lichenora jerdoniana, commonly known as the Jerdon's lichen, is a unique composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It is typically found growing on rocks, tree bark, or soil in humid environments. This lichen is characterized by its crust-like growth form and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants. It has a limited geographic distribution, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists and ecologists for its ecological role and potential medicinal properties.</p>
