                    <h1>Loranthus falcatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus falcatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense clusters on tree branches.</p>
