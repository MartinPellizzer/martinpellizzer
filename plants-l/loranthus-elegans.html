                    <h1>Loranthus elegans</h1>
<p>Loranthus elegans, commonly known as the elegant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily eucalyptus and other hardwoods.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that are often visited by insects and birds. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its spread.</p>
<p>Loranthus elegans is an important part of the ecosystem, providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
