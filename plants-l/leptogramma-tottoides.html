                    <h1>Leptogramma tottoides</h1>
<p>Leptogramma tottoides, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread across forest floors.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species.</p>
