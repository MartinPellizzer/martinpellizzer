                    <h1>Lycopodium cernuum var. minus</h1>
<p>Lycopodium cernuum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of prostrate, scale-like leaves that are rich in sporangia, which produce spores for reproduction. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its small, clustered sporophytes are often found on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to the typical Lycopodium cernuum.</p>
