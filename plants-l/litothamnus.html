                    <h1>Litothamnus</h1>
<p>Litothamnus, commonly known as rockweed, is a genus of red algae found primarily in marine environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in intertidal zones and is characterized by its calcified cell walls, which contribute to its structural rigidity. The plant forms dense mats on rocky substrates, providing habitat for various marine organisms. Litothamnus species are often used as a source of agar and have applications in both culinary and industrial settings.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a primary producer in coastal ecosystems.</p>
