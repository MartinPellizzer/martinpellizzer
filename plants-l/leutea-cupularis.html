<p>Leutea cupularis, commonly known as the cupular lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically yellowish to reddish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on decaying wood or bark in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Leutea cupularis plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
