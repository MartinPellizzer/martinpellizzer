                    <h1>Lasiocephalus superparamensis</h1>
<p>Lasiocephalus superparamensis, commonly known as the Parambikulam rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features hairy stems that give it its genus name "Lasiocephalus.". The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
