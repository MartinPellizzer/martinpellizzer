<p>Lamproconus warszewiczii, commonly known as the Warszewicz's star-flower, is a rare flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
