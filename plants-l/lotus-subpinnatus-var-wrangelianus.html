                    <h1>Lotus subpinnatus var. wrangelianus</h1>
<p>Lotus subpinnatus var. wrangelianus, commonly known as Wrangel's lotus, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal and tundra ecosystems.</p>
