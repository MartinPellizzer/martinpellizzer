<p>Lotodes aculeatum, commonly known as the spiked water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies.</p>
<p>The spiny structures on its leaves and stems are adaptations for deterring herbivores and aiding in buoyancy.</p>
