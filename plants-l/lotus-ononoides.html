                    <h1>Lotus ononoides</h1>
<p>Lotus ononoides, commonly known as the sweet sedge, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in still water.</p>
<p>Lotus ononoides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in water garden designs.</p>
