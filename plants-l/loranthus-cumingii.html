                    <h1>Loranthus cumingii</h1>
<p>Loranthus cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's small, white or pale yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its berries are red or orange and contain sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Loranthus cumingii plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for various bird species.</p>
