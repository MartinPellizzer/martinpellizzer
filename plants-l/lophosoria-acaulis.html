                    <h1>Lophosoria acaulis</h1>
<p>Lophosoria acaulis, commonly known as the slender lophosoria, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, upright stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom during the warmer months. Lophosoria acaulis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
