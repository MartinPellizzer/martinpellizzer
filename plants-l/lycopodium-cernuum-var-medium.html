<p>Lycopodium cernuum var. medium, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to form dense mats, it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
