<p>Leucadendron cartilagineum, commonly known as the silver torchbrush, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost otherworldly appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange flower heads during the summer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
