The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by woody, spiny pods containing seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique and visually striking plant in gardens and natural habitats.</p>
