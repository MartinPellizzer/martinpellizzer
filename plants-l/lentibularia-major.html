                    <h1>Lentibularia major</h1>
<p>Lentibularia major, commonly known as the greater bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It has slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged.</p>
<p>Lentibularia major is a carnivorous plant, relying on the nutrients obtained from captured prey to supplement its nutrient-poor habitat.</p>
