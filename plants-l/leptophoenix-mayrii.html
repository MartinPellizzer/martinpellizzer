<p>Leptophoenix mayrii, commonly known as the Mayri's date palm, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, multi-trunked structure with pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palms. Its fruit is a small, fibrous drupe that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Leptophoenix mayrii is considered critically endangered.</p>
