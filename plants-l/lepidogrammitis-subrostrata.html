<p>Lepidogrammitis subrostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
