                    <h1>Lewisia pygmaea var. nevadensis</h1>
<p>Lewisia pygmaea var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lewisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
