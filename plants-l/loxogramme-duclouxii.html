                    <h1>Loxogramme duclouxii</h1>
<p>Loxogramme duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, needle-like leaves that create a lacy appearance, aiding in water filtration and oxygenation. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
