<p>Laestadia muscicola, commonly known as the mossy liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Laetophyceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>Laestadia muscicola plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
