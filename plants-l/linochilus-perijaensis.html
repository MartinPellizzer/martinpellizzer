<p>Linochilus perijaensis, commonly known as the Perijan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
