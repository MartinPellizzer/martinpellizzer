                    <h1>Listrostachys bidens</h1>
<p>Listrostachys bidens, commonly known as the common burrweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are typically glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, followed by the characteristic burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and persistent seeds, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
