                    <h1>Linum hologynum</h1>
<p>Linum hologynum, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the Linaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale blue to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linum hologynum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
