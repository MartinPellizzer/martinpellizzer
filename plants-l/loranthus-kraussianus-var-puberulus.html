                    <h1>Loranthus kraussianus var. puberulus</h1>
<p>Loranthus kraussianus var. puberulus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals.</p>
<p>This species is native to southern Africa and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats.</p>
