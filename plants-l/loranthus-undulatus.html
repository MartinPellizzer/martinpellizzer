                    <h1>Loranthus undulatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus undulatus, commonly known as the wavy-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are typically undulating and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Loranthus undulatus is found in Australia and is an example of a hemiparasitic plant that relies on its host for survival.</p>
