                    <h1>Lotus yollabolliensis</h1>
<p>Lotus yollabolliensis, commonly known as the Yollabolli lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater lakes and ponds, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
