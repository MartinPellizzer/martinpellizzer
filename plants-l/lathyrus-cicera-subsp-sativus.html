<p>Lathyrus cicera subsp.</p>
<p>sativus, commonly known as the field vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple.</p>
<p>The plant produces elongated pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
