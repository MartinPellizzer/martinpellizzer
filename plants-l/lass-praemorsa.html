<p>Lass praemorsa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a single, slender stem and a cluster of pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in pine flatwoods and scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
