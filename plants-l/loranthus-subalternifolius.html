                    <h1>Loranthus subalternifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus subalternifolius, commonly known as the lesser mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a modified root system called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It primarily inhabits tropical and subtropical regions, often found on species of the family Fabaceae. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain toxic seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health and growth of its host tree.</p>
