<p>Larrea monticellii, commonly known as the mountain grevillea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zygophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a waxy coating on its leaves to minimize evaporation.</p>
<p>Larrea monticellii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
