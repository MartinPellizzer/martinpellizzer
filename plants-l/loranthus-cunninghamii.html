                    <h1>Loranthus cunninghamii</h1>
<p>Loranthus cunninghamii, commonly known as the Australian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native animals and contributing to the biodiversity of forest canopies.</p>
<p>Its growth is often limited by the availability of suitable host trees and environmental conditions.</p>
