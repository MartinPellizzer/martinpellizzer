                    <h1>Lagenocarpus distichophyllus</h1>
<p>Lagenocarpus distichophyllus, commonly known as the two-ranked leaf fern, is a fossilized plant that provides important insights into ancient plant life.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-ranked leaves, which are preserved in sedimentary rock layers. This plant is often found in coal deposits and is considered a key indicator of Carboniferous ecosystems. Its structure suggests it was a primitive fern-like plant with a vascular system.</p>
<p>The study of Lagenocarpus distichophyllus helps scientists understand the evolution of early land plants and their ecological roles.</p>
