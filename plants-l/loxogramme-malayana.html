<p>Loxogramme malayana, commonly known as the Malay water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water ferns.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Loxogramme malayana plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
