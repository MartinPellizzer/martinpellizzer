<p>Lecythis confertiflora, commonly known as the Amazonian oil tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces a heavy, oily fruit with a hard, woody shell enclosing a nutrient-rich pulp. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible oil.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and economic value, it is also a target for deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
