The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
