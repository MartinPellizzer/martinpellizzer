                    <h1>Loranthus involucratus</h1>
<p>Loranthus involucratus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus involucratus plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and influencing host tree growth.</p>
