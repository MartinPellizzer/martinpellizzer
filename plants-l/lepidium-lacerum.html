<p>Lepidium lacerum, commonly known as the brokenhearted cress, is a small annual herb native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a low-growing stem with alternate, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
