<p>Liparis chimanimaniensis, commonly known as the Chimanimani orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Chimanimani Mountains of eastern Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming during the late summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
