<p>Luetkea pectinata, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, lobed segments, resembling the shape of clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored to the substrate, while its stems and leaves remain buoyant on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Luetkea pectinata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
