                    <h1>Lepisorus iridescens</h1>
<p>Lepisorus iridescens, commonly known as the iridescent fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a striking iridescence under light. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the wet season.</p>
