<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lepisanthes schizolepis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
