                    <h1>Lesquerella parviflora</h1>
<p>Lesquerella parviflora, commonly known as the small-flower lesquerella, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain oily seeds, which are rich in triglycerides and have industrial applications. Lesquerella parviflora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its potential as a source of renewable oils and its role in ecological systems.</p>
