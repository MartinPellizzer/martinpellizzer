                    <h1>Loranthus gibberulus var. tatei</h1>
<p>Loranthus gibberulus var. tatei, commonly known as the Tate's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and has a distinctive appearance with small, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits through nitrogen fixation. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries and later excrete the seeds onto new host trees.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and unique parasitic adaptations.</p>
