<p>Lycopodium varium var. umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and delicate variant of the clubmoss family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dark green foliage that thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the fronds. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and is often found in temperate forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
