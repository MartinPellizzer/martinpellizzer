                    <h1>Lepidozamia minor</h1>
<p>Lepidozamia minor, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a thick, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, typical of ferns. Lepidozamia minor is a relic of the Mesozoic era, showcasing evolutionary adaptations that have allowed it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
