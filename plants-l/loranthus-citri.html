                    <h1>Loranthus citri</h1>
<p>Loranthus citri, commonly known as the citrus mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of citrus trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its life cycle involves seeds that are dispersed by birds eating the berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus citri is an important component of the ecological interactions in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
