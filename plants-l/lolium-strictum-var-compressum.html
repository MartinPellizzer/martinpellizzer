<p>Lolium strictum var. compressum, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its fine texture and ability to form dense turf, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping.</p>
