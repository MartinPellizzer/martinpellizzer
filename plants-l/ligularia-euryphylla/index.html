<p>Euryphylla ligularia, scientifically known as Ligularia euryphylla, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. With its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers, it stands out as a unique addition to any garden or natural landscape. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens and bog gardens.
