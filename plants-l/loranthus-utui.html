                    <h1>Loranthus utui</h1>
<p>Loranthus utui, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus utui is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
