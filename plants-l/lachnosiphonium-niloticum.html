<p>Lachnosiphonium niloticum, commonly known as the Nile liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Lophoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and damp forests. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and preference for humid conditions make it an important indicator species in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
