<p>Lecticula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its unique appearance and habitat requirements make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species in its natural range.</p>
