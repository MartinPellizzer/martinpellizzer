<p>Labichea cassioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Labichea cassioides is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
