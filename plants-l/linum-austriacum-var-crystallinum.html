                    <h1>Linum austriacum var. crystallinum</h1>
<p>Linum austriacum var. crystallinum, commonly known as the crystalline flax, is a rare and striking variant of the flax species native to the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a glass-like appearance, a feature that sets it apart from other flax varieties. The plant produces delicate blue or purple flowers, typical of the Linaceae family, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
