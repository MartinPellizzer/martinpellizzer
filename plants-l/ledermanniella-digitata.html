<p>Ledermanniella digitata, commonly known as the digitate leaf fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features finely divided, finger-like leaves that give it its common name. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
