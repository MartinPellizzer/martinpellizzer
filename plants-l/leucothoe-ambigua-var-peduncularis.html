                    <h1>Leucothoe ambigua var. peduncularis</h1>
<p>Leucothoe ambigua var. peduncularis, commonly known as the clustered leucothoe, is a flowering shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, floral display, and seasonal fruiting.</p>
