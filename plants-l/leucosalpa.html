                    <h1>Leucosalpa</h1>
<p>Leucosalpa, commonly known as the white lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and phototrophic partners. Leucosalpa plays a crucial role in ecological systems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes make it an important indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
