<p>Lycopodium gnidioides, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its erect, spire-like growth habit.</p>
<p>It produces small, cone-like strobila at the tips of its stems, which contain the sporangia for spore production. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lycopodium gnidioides is a perennial plant that thrives in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure.</p>
