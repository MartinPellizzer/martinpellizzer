                    <h1>Lactuca dunlapii</h1>
<p>Lactuca dunlapii, commonly known as the desert lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Lactuca dunlapii is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions.</p>
