                    <h1>Linnaea zanderi</h1>
<p>Linnaea zanderi, commonly known as the Zander's twinflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its two small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linnaea zanderi is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
