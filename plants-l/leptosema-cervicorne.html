                    <h1>Leptosema cervicorne</h1>
<p>Leptosema cervicorne, commonly known as the neck-horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominently hooded labellum that resembles a horn, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers are small and pale green, with a distinct, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptosema cervicorne is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
