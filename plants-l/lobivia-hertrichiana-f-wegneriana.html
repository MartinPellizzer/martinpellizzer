<p>Lobivia hertrichiana f. wegneriana, commonly known as the Wegner's lobivia, is a rare and striking succulent native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of thick, fleshy, silver-blue leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces tall, branching stems with clusters of bright yellow flowers during the cooler months. It is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a delicate and sought-after species among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
