                    <h1>Lecticula spruceana</h1>
<p>Lecticula spruceana, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest understories. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor itself firmly in rocky substrates while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Lecticula spruceana plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
