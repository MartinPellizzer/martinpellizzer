                    <h1>Lythrum salicaria f. rariflorum</h1>
<p>Lythrum salicaria f. rariflorum, commonly known as the rare-flowered loosestrife, is a rare botanical variant of the common purple loosestrife.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced floral display compared to the typical form, with fewer and smaller flowers along the inflorescence. The plant belongs to the Lythraceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it forms dense stands.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its unique floral morphology and its role in ecological studies of plant variation.</p>
