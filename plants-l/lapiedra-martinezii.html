                    <h1>Lapiedra martinezii</h1>
<p>Lapiedra martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's rock plant, is a rare and endemic species native to the rocky habitats of southern Spain.</p>
<p>It is a small, flowering plant that typically grows in limestone and granite substrates, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, reflecting its drought-tolerant nature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lapiedra martinezii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
