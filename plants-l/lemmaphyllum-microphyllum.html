<p>Lemmaphyllum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved lemmaphyllum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which are followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is important for understanding the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
