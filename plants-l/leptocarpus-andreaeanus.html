<p>Leptocarpus andreaeanus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea grape, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tubular flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas with high salinity and tidal influence. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by insects, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
