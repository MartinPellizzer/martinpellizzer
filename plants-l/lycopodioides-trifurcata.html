                    <h1>Lycopodioides trifurcata</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant's stems are often prostrate or creeping, with a distinct branching pattern that gives it its common name. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the base of the plant, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This ancient lineage of plants is closely related to modern ferns and mosses, showcasing early evolutionary adaptations in vascular plant development.</p>
