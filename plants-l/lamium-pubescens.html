                    <h1>Lamium pubescens</h1>
<p>Lamium pubescens, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects its historical use as a weed in gardens, though it is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
