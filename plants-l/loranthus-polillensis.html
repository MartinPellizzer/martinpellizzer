                    <h1>Loranthus polillensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus polillensis, commonly known as the Polill√© mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Theaceae, through a specialized structure called a haustellum. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but performs photosynthesis to some extent. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses its seeds through bird droppings, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
