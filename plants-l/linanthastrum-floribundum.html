<p>Linanthastrum floribundum, commonly known as the showy linanthastrum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the warmer months. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and xeriscaping landscapes.</p>
