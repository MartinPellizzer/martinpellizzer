<p>Leptochilus decurrens var. rasamalae, commonly known as the red-stemmed leatherydock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, succulent stems that are often reddish in color, and its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique stem coloration and habitat preferences compared to other members of the genus.</p>
