<p>Lessingianthus hystricosus, commonly known as the hairy sunflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America.</p>

The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent central disk and surrounding ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to reseed itself, it is often used in wildflower mixes and ecological restoration projects.</p>
