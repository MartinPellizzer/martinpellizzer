                            <h1>Lunaria Annua Subsp. Pachyrrhiza</h1>
<p>Lunaria annua subsp. pachyrrhiza is a lesser-known member of the Brassicaceae family known for its unique seed pods. This subspecies thrives in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its striking blue-violet flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's distinctive seed capsules split open to reveal shiny, coin-like seeds that are both ornamental and useful in traditional crafts. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated compared to its more common relatives.</p>
