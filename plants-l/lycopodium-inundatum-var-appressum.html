                    <h1>Lycopodium inundatum var. appressum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium inundatum var. appressum, commonly known as the swamp clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats, and it produces spore-bearing cones called strobili. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it is an indicator species for poorly drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
