                    <h1>Lachnostoma prostratum</h1>
<p>Lachnostoma prostratum, commonly known as the creeping lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered with a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the substrate.</p>
<p>Lachnostoma prostratum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
