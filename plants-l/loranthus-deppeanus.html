                    <h1>Loranthus deppeanus</h1>
<p>Loranthus deppeanus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks and other hardwoods.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found in forested areas.</p>
