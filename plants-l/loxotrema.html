<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a basal rosette of leaves and an erect flowering stem. The leaves are typically lanceolate and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Loxotrema species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
