<p>Lellingeria tmesipteris, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a species of cycad native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper stem. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
