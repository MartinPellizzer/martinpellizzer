                    <h1>Leptochloa pectinata</h1>
<p>Leptochloa pectinata, commonly known as the silky grass or silky couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in disturbed soils and grasslands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is classified within the Poaceae family, and its structure reflects adaptations to arid and nutrient-poor environments.</p>
