                    <h1>Loranthus ovalis</h1>
<p>Loranthus ovalis, commonly known as the oval mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees to initiate new infections.</p>
<p>Loranthus ovalis plays an important ecological role by providing food for various birds and insects.</p>
