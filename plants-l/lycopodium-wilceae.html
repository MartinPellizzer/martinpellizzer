<p>Lycopodium wilceae, commonly known as ground pine, is a small, evergreen shrub that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium wilceae is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage places it among the earliest vascular plants, making it a valuable species for studying plant evolution.</p>
