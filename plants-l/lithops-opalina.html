<p>Lithops opalina, commonly known as the "Living Stone," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant's leaves are typically pale green or bluish-gray, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Lithops opalina is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
