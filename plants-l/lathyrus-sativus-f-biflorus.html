                    <h1>Lathyrus sativus f. biflorus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus sativus f. biflorus, commonly known as the twin-flowered grass pea, is a variant of the grass pea plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-flowered inflorescences, which set it apart from the typical single-flowered form. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its edible seeds, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful processing before consumption.</p>
