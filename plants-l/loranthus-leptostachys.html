                    <h1>Loranthus leptostachys</h1>
<p>Loranthus leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically eaten by birds, which then disperse its seeds. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
