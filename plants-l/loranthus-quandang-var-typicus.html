                    <h1>Loranthus quandang var. typicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus quandang var. typicus, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain one or two seeds.</p>
<p>This species is widely distributed in China and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
