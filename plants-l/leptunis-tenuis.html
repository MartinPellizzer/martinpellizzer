                    <h1>Leptunis tenuis</h1>
<p>Leptunis tenuis, commonly known as the slender lepidophyll, is a unique succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, thread-like stems that can curl into a compact ball when dry. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season, which are often short-lived. Its leaves are reduced to scales, and it stores water in its stems to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Leptunis tenuis is adapted to extreme heat and low moisture, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
