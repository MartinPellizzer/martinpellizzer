                    <h1>Leptosema aphyllum</h1>
<p>Leptosema aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and roots. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health of its host trees.</p>
