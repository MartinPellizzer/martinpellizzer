                    <h1>Lycopodium vanikorense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium vanikorense, commonly known as the Vanikoro clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species of lycopod found primarily in the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, creeping plant with spore-bearing cones and is closely related to other members of the Lycopodiaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Its conservation status is critical due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Lycopodium vanikorense plays a unique role in its ecosystem, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
