                    <h1>Lockhartia oerstedii</h1>
<p>Lockhartia oerstedii, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, velvety pink flowers that resemble a lady's slipper, with a deep pink pouch and intricate markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
