                    <h1>Limnia</h1>
<p>Limnia, commonly known as the water flea, is a genus of small crustaceans belonging to the order Cladocera.</p>
<p>These organisms are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. Limnia species are characterized by their transparent, segmented bodies and the presence of a carapace that covers their head and thorax. They play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems as primary consumers, feeding on algae and organic debris.</p>
<p>Due to their sensitivity to environmental changes, they are often used as bioindicators of water quality.</p>
