<p>Limonium acutifolium subsp.</p>
<p>bosanum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, an adaptation to its saline environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
