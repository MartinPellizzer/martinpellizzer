                    <h1>Limnophila micrantha</h1>
<p>Limnophila micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its roots submerged and leaves floating or emergent. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Limnophila micrantha plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
