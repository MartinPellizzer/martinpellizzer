<p>Lechea torreyi var. congesta, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among milkweed species, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically alternate and oval-shaped, with a rough texture adapted to conserve water.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees.</p>
