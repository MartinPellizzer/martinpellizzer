                    <h1>Lastrea patentissima</h1>
<p>Lastrea patentissima, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can thrive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and garden use in dry climates.</p>
