<p>Lawrencia chrysoderma, commonly known as the golden skin lichen, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen that forms a thin, crust-like layer on rock surfaces, typically in moist, shaded environments. The thallus is yellowish to orange in color, with a smooth, leathery texture. It lacks distinct lobes but has a uniform, dense structure.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
