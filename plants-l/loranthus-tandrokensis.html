                    <h1>Loranthus tandrokensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus tandrokensis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited leaf structures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to bird feathers for dispersal.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Loranthus tandrokensis plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by supporting various insect and bird species.</p>
