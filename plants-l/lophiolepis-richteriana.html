                    <h1>Lophiolepis richteriana</h1>
<p>Lophiolepis richteriana, commonly known as the Richter's lichen, is a type of crustose lichen that forms a thin, tightly adhering layer on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus with distinct, elongated lobes. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to thrive in harsh, arid environments. It is commonly found in rocky, sunny habitats across southern Africa, including Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its role in soil stabilization and its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
