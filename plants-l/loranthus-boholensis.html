                    <h1>Loranthus boholensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus boholensis, commonly known as the Bohol mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as mango and papaya, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
