<p>Lamium garganicum subsp.</p>
<p>lasioclades, commonly known as the woolly deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
