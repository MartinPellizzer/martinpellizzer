                    <h1>Lathraea strobilacea</h1>
<p>Lathraea strobilacea, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique succulent belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is known for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, appearing dead but reviving when water becomes available. The plant has a creeping, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense umbel, typical of its family.</p>
<p>Lathraea strobilacea is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
