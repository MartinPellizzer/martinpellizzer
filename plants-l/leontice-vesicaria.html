<p>Leontice vesicaria, commonly known as the blistering grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its name derives from the blistering effect caused by its sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Leontice vesicaria is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
