                    <h1>Lithops alpina</h1>
<p>Lithops alpina, commonly known as the Alpine stone plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with two fleshy leaves that resemble stones. The plant thrives in arid and rocky environments, often growing in crevices or on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Lithops alpina produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring, adding a subtle touch of color to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
