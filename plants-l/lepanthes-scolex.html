<p>Lepanthes scolex, commonly known as the scarlet lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, pinkish-red floral spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, tubular flowers arranged in a dense, parallel sequence, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Lepanthes scolex thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical ecosystems.</p>
