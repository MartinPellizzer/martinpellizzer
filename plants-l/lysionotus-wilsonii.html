<p>Lysionotus wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's ghostflower, is a delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair to retain moisture.</p>
