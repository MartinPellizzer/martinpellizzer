                    <h1>Ledgeria</h1>
<p>Ledgeria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Ledgeria thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests.</p>
