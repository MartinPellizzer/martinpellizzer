                    <h1>Loranthus combretoides</h1>
<p>Loranthus combretoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Combretaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which contain seeds, are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa.</p>
