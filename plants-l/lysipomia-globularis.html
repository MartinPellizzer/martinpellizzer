                    <h1>Lysipomia globularis</h1>
<p>Lysipomia globularis, commonly known as the globular cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like clusters of small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in tight, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Lysipomia globularis is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal.</p>
