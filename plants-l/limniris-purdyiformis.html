                <h1>Limniris purdyiformis</h1>
<p>Limniris purdyiformis, commonly known as the Purdy's water lily, is a unique aquatic plant native to specific freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a dense canopy on the water surface, providing shelter for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, urn-shaped structure that attracts pollinators such as beetles and moths. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Limniris purdyiformis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
