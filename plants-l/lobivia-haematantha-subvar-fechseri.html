<p>Lobivia haematantha subvar. fechseri, commonly known as the "Red-veined Lobivia," is a compact, flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with ribbed structure and produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red and orange. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It blooms during the summer months, typically from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>This subvariety is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
