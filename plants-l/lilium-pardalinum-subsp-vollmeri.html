<p>Lilium pardalinum subsp.</p>
<p>vollmeri, commonly known as the Vollmer's lily, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant produces recurved, often fragrant blooms with six to eight petals, and its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. It prefers well-drained, fertile soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
