                    <h1>Loranthus bequaertii</h1>
<p>Loranthus bequaertii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees in Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
