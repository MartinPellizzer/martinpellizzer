                    <h1>Limnorchis leptoceratitis</h1>
<p>Limnorchis leptoceratitis, commonly known as the slender-bellied flatworm, is a parasitic trematode belonging to the family Platyhelminthes.</p>
<p>It primarily infects freshwater snails, particularly those of the genus *Lymnaea*, serving as an intermediate host in its life cycle. The adult worms are typically found in the digestive tract of their definitive hosts, which include various birds and mammals. Morphologically, they exhibit a flattened, ribbon-like body with a complex reproductive system.</p>
<p>This species plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of freshwater ecosystems through its parasitic interactions.</p>
