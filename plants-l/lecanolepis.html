                    <h1>Lecanolepis</h1>
<p>Lecanolepis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a genus of lichens that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>These organisms are composite organisms consisting of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Lecanolepis species are often found growing on rocks, soil, or bark in various habitats, including arid and temperate regions. They are characterized by their crust-like growth form and distinct chemical compositions, which contribute to their ecological roles in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to their slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, they are valuable indicators of air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
