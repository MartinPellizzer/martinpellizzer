                    <h1>Leptopoda</h1>
<p>Leptopoda, commonly known as the "whisk fern," is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Psilotales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and roots, instead having small, scale-like structures called enations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Leptopoda has a simple, unbranched stem that bears sporangia at the nodes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology reflects its ancient evolutionary lineage within the plant kingdom.</p>
