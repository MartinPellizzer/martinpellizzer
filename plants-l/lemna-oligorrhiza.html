                    <h1>Lemna oligorrhiza</h1>
<p>Lemna oligorrhiza, commonly known as the narrow-leaf duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant floats on the surface of freshwater bodies and has a rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats. Its roots are short and adventitious, anchoring it to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>Lemna oligorrhiza is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions and is used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
