                    <h1>Loranthus falcifolius var. katangensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus falcifolius var. katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Its presence is often indicative of specific forest ecosystems in the region.</p>
