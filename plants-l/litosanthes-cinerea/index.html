                            <h1>Litosanthes Cinerea</h1>
<p>Cineraria, scientifically known as Litosanthes cinerea, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Canary Islands. This plant is celebrated for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Though it thrives in coastal environments, it can also be cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and ample sunlight. Its name derives from the Greek words "kineron" meaning smoke and "eirene" meaning peace, possibly referencing its smoky appearance or calming presence. Despite its beauty, it requires careful attention to avoid overwatering, as it is susceptible to root rot in humid conditions.</p>
