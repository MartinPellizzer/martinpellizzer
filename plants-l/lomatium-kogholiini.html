                    <h1>Lomatium kogholiini</h1>
<p>Lomatium kogholiini, commonly known as the mountain lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, particularly found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with finely divided, fern-like foliage that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in complex umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Lomatium kogholiini is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
