<p>Lathyrus vernus, commonly known as the spring vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and western Asia and is known for its delicate, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 centimeters, with trifoliate leaves and slender, climbing stems. Its flowers are usually pink or violet, and it produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds.</p>
