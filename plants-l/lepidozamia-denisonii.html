                    <h1>Lepidozamia denisonii</h1>
<p>Lepidozamia denisonii, commonly known as the Denison's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
