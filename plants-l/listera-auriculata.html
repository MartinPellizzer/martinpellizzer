                    <h1>Listera auriculata</h1>
<p>Listera auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate wintergreen, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Listera auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for early pollinators.</p>
