                    <h1>Loranthus henriquesii</h1>
<p>Loranthus henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife.</p>
