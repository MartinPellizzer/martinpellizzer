                    <h1>Lemna orbiculata</h1>
<p>Lemna orbiculata, commonly known as the water clover, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae).</p>
<p>It has tiny, broad, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients directly through its leaf surfaces. It reproduces rapidly by producing tiny tubers that detach and float to new locations.</p>
<p>Lemna orbiculata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
