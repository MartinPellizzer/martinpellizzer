<p>Lupinus giganteus, commonly known as the giant lupine, is a tall, flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet pea-like flowers and tall, slender stems. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Lupinus giganteus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>This makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession and a valuable plant for soil enrichment.</p>
