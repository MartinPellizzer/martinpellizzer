                    <h1>Loranthus incanus var. gossweileri</h1>
<p>Loranthus incanus var. gossweileri, commonly known as the Gossweiler's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forested areas with suitable host trees.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
