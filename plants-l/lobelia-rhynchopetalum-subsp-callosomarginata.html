<p>Lobelia rhynchopetalum subsp.</p>
<p>callosomarginata, commonly known as the Sierra lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect stems and small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is typically found in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
