<p>Lepidium pedicellosum, commonly known as the clustered peppergrass, is a small flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common strategy among members of the Brassicaceae family. Lepidium pedicellosum thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardening.</p>
