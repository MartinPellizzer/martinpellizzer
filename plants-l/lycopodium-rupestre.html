                    <h1>Lycopodium rupestre</h1>
<p>Lycopodium rupestre, commonly known as the rock moss, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky and dry environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically reddish in color. Lycopodium rupestre is often found in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of rocky ecosystems.</p>
