<p>Lophiaris morenoi, commonly known as the Moreno's lophiaris, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many succulent plants adapted to arid environments. The plant features a compact, rosette-like growth form with fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lophiaris morenoi is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
