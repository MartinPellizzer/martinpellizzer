                    <h1>Lagerstroemia suprareticulata</h1>
<p>Lagerstroemia suprareticulata, commonly known as the red flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that range in color from red to pink, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that appear after the bracts have faded. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a serrated margin.</p>
<p>Lagerstroemia suprareticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental display and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
