                    <h1>Loranthus longispicatus var. grandifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus longispicatus var. grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, fleshy berries as fruit.</p>
<p>This variant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
