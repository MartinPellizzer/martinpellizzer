                    <h1>Lepanthes medusa</h1>
<p>Lepanthes medusa, commonly known as the Medusa orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble the mythological figure of Medusa, featuring intricate patterns and a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree bark rather than growing in soil.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and its role in the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
