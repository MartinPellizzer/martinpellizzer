<p>Lithocarpus bacgiangensis subsp.</p>
<p>bentramensis, commonly known as the Benthram's stone栎, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its hard, woody fruit and evergreen leaves. It is native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in Vietnam and possibly parts of Laos.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are革质 (leathery) and have a prominent midrib, while the fruit is a one-seeded nut enclosed in a thick, woody husk.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in tropical rainforests.</p>
