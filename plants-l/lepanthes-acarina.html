                    <h1>Lepanthes acarina</h1>
<p>Lepanthes acarina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Lepanthes acarina thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
