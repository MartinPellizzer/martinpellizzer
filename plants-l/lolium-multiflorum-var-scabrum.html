<p>Lolium multiflorum var. scabrum, commonly known as rough ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
