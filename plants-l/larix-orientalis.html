                    <h1>Larix orientalis</h1>
<p>Larix orientalis, commonly known as the Oriental larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cone-shaped crown and needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before shedding. The tree produces small, woody cones that release winged seeds, aiding in its wind dispersal. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This hardy species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
