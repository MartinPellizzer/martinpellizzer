                <h1>Lotodes angustifolium</h1>
<p>Lotodes angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Lotodes angustifolium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
