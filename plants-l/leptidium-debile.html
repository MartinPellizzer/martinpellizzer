<p>Leptidium debile, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which aid in buoyancy and gas exchange. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Leptidium debile plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
