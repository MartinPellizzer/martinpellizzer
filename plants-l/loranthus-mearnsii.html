                    <h1>Loranthus mearnsii</h1>
<p>Loranthus mearnsii, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is native to Australia and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive.</p>
<p>Its ecological impact is significant, as it can weaken or kill its host trees over time.</p>
