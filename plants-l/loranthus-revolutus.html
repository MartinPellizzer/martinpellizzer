                    <h1>Loranthus revolutus</h1>
<p>Loranthus revolutus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, alternate, ovate leaves and produces white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in regions with warm, temperate climates.</p>
