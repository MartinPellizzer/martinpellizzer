<p>Larix dahurica var. americana, commonly known as the American larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to shed its needle-like leaves in the fall, turning golden before falling. The tree has slender, exfoliating bark that reveals a reddish-brown inner layer as it ages. Its cones are small, woody, and typically hang in clusters, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along river valleys.</p>
