<p>Lythrum tribracteatum, commonly known as purple loosestrife, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy spikes of purple to pink flowers that bloom from June to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its root system is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread aggressively and become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Lythrum tribracteatum is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
