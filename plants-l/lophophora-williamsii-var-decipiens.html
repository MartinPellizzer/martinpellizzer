                    <h1>Lophophora williamsii var. decipiens</h1>
<p>Lophophora williamsii var. decipiens, commonly known as the "peyote" cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert.</p>
<p>It features a short, swollen stem with a single central areola, from which it produces white, radial spines. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stem, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It also contains psychoactive alkaloids, primarily mescaline, which have been used traditionally by indigenous cultures.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties and conservation status, it is protected in many regions.</p>
