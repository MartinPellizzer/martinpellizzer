<p>Lobelia bellidifolia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrata' variety has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
