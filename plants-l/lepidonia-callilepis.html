                    <h1>Lepidonia callilepis</h1>
<p>Lepidonia callilepis, commonly known as the coastal lepidonia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers during the cooler months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Lepidonia callilepis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
