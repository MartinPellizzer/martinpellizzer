<p>Lorandersonia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved lorandersonia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in association with trees in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
