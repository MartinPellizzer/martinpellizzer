                    <h1>Leymus × vancouverensis</h1>
<p>Leymus × vancouverensis, commonly known as Vancouver needlegrass, is a sterile hybrid grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant forms dense tussocks and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative reproduction for propagation.</p>
