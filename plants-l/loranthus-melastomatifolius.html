                    <h1>Loranthus melastomatifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus melastomatifolius, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other mistletoe species.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role by providing food for various birds and insects.</p>
