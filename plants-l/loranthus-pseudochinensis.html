                    <h1>Loranthus pseudochinensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus pseudochinensis, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is native to East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host trees.</p>
