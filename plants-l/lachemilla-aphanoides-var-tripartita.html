<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
