                    <h1>Lonicera diervilla</h1>
<p>Lonicera diervilla, commonly known as barrenberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Lonicera diervilla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited due to its lack of showy foliage, but it plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
