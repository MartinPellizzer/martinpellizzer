<p>Lithocardium macleodii, commonly known as the Macleod's lithocardium, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with simple, alternate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, often displaying a pale pink to white coloration. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
