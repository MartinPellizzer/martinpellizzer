<p>Lankesterella parvula, commonly known as the small liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Lankesterella parvula is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
