<p>Limnophila chinensis subsp.</p>
<p>aromatica, commonly known as sweet marshwort, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, delicate white flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its stronger fragrance compared to other members of the Limnophila genus.</p>
