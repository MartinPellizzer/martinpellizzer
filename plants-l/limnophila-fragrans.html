<p>Limnophila fragrans, commonly known as sweetflag, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Pontederiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow waters, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, often contributing to the structure of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
