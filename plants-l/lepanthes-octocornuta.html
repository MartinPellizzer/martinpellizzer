<p>Lepanthes octocornuta, commonly known as the eight-horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature multiple sepals and petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>The genus Lepanthes is known for its diversity in floral morphology, and L. octocornuta exemplifies this with its unique, horn-like projections on the petals.</p>
