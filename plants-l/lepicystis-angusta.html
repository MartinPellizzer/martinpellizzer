<p>Lepicystis angusta, commonly known as the narrow-cysted liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically flat and closely spaced. This liverwort thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized cups called gemma cups.</p>
<p>Lepicystis angusta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
