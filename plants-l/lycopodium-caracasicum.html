<p>Lycopodium caracasicum, commonly known as the Caracasi clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiales and is characterized by its creeping, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
