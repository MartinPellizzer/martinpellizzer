<p>Launaea procumbens, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often spreading via horizontal stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Launaea procumbens is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
