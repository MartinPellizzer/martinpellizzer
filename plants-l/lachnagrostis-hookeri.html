<p>Lachnagrostis hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in small, compact groups.</p>
<p>Lachnagrostis hookeri is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat.</p>
