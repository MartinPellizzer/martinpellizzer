                    <h1>Lythrum hexagonum</h1>
<p>Lythrum hexagonum, commonly known as purple loosestrife, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom from midsummer to early autumn. It is adapted to moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>However, it has become an invasive species in North America, outcompeting native vegetation and altering wetland ecosystems.</p>
