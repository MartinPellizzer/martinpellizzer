                    <h1>Leontopodium japonicum var. microcephalum</h1>
<p>Leontopodium japonicum var. microcephalum, commonly known as the dwarf edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and small, clustered flowers that resemble the classic edelweiss. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its compact growth form and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival in non-native settings.</p>
