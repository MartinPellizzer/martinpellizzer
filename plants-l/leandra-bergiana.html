<p>Leandra bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and rarity, Leandra bergiana is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
