                    <h1>Loxomorchis</h1>
<p>Loxomorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white, leafless stems and small, delicate flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
