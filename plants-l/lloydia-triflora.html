                    <h1>Lloydia triflora</h1>
<p>Lloydia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered lloydia, is a rare and striking member of the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in California and Nevada. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lloydia triflora is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
