<p>Lobivia variispina, commonly known as the variable-spined lobivia, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered with clusters of white or pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
