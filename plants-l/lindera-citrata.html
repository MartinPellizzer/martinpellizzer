<p>Lindera citrata, commonly known as the lemon thyme or Japanese spice bush, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features aromatic leaves that emit a citrus-like scent when crushed, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, particularly in Chinese cuisine, for their distinctive flavor.</p>
<p>Lindera citrata thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens.</p>
