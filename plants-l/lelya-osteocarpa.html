<p>Lelya osteocarpa, commonly known as the rock saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Lelya osteocarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and withstand drought conditions.</p>
