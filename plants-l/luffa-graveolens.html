<p>Luffa graveolens, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, hairy leaves and elongated, fibrous fruits that mature into spongy structures. The plant produces yellow flowers and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its fibrous inner layer, known as luffa, is harvested when fully mature for use as a natural exfoliant.</p>
<p>Luffa graveolens is also valued for its edible young fruits and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
