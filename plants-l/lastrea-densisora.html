                    <h1>Lastrea densisora</h1>
<p>Lastrea densisora, commonly known as the dense-leaved lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Lastrea densisora thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
