<p>Lepanthes endresii, commonly known as the Endres's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with yellow markings, which are typically borne on slender, branching inflorescences. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base and are somewhat fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Lepanthes endresii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
