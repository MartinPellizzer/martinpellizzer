                    <h1>Loranthus villosiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus villosiflorus, commonly known as the hairy-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on acacia and other woody plants. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually small, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Loranthus villosiflorus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, despite its parasitic nature.</p>
