<p>Launaea jaumei, commonly known as the Jaume's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its thick, spiny stems and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits similar to those of the prickly pear cactus. Launaea jaumei is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with features such as reduced leaves and a succulent stem that help conserve water.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
