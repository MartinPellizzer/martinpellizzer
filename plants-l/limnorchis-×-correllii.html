                    <h1>Limnorchis × correllii</h1>
<p>Limnorchis × correllii, commonly known as the hybrid water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant that results from the cross between Limnorchis fluitans and Limnorchis sanguinea.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, floating leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are usually pale yellow and are borne in clusters near the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
