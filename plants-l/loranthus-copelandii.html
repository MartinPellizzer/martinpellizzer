                    <h1>Loranthus copelandii</h1>
<p>Loranthus copelandii, commonly known as the copeland's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, leafy growth that can significantly impact the host tree's health if left unchecked. Its small, white or pink flowers are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees are present.</p>
