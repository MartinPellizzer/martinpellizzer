                    <h1>Lotus brachycarpus</h1>
<p>Lotus brachycarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit water plantain, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in spikes, and the fruit is a narrow, three-lobed capsule.</p>
<p>Lotus brachycarpus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
