                    <h1>Leptonychia</h1>
<p>Leptonychia, commonly known as the "liverwort," is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the division Marchantiophyta.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. Leptonychia plants have a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. They reproduce through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
