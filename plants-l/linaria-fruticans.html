                    <h1>Linaria fruticans</h1>
<p>Linaria fruticans, commonly known as the desert snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that resemble small snapdragons, typically blooming from spring to summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Linaria fruticans is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
