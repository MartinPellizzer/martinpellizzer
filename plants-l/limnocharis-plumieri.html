                    <h1>Limnocharis plumieri</h1>
<p>Limnocharis plumieri, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has soft, velvety leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it float on water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom above the water surface. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater bodies such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
