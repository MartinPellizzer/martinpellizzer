<p>Ledothamnus, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plants typically produce small, clustered flowers with five petals, often in shades of pink or white. Ledothamnus species are native to regions with rocky or alpine habitats, such as parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions.</p>
