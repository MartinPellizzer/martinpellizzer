                    <h1>Lepanthes minetii</h1>
<p>Lepanthes minetii, commonly known as the Minet's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>This small, epiphytic orchid typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. It features delicate, spurred flowers that are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns on the dorsal sepal and petals. The plant has a short, erect stem and produces small, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepanthes minetii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
