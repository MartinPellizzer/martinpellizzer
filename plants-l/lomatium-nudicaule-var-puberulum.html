                    <h1>Lomatium nudicaule var. puberulum</h1>
<p>Lomatium nudicaule var. puberulum, commonly known as the hairy leaf lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clustered umbels, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is often distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which gives it its specific epithet "puberulum.".</p>
