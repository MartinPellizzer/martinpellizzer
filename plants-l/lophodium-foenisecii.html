<p>Lophodium foenisecii, commonly known as the common lichen of the genus Lophodium, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, leaf-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish color and a finely wrinkled surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks, stumps, and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
