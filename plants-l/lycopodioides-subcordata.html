                    <h1>Lycopodioides subcordata</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides subcordata, commonly known as the broad-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like clusters on the ground. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
