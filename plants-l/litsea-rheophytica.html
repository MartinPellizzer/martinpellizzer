                    <h1>Litsea rheophytica</h1>
<p>Litsea rheophytica, commonly known as the streamlit litsea, is a rare tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. This waxy layer helps the plant retain moisture in its humid, rainforest habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by yellowish fruits that are edible for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Litsea rheophytica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
