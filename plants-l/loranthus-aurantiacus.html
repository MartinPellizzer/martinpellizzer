                    <h1>Loranthus aurantiacus</h1>
<p>Loranthus aurantiacus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating its spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful.</p>
