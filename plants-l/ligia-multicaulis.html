                    <h1>Ligia multicaulis</h1>
<p>Ligia multicaulis, commonly known as the common marsh bugle, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ligia multicaulis thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various invertebrates and its contribution to wetland biodiversity.</p>
