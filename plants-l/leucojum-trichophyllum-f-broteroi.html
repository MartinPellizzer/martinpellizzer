                    <h1>Leucojum trichophyllum f. broteroi</h1>
<p>Leucojum trichophyllum f. broteroi, commonly known as the Broter's white squill, is a rare and striking botanical variant of the white squill species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to April. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is often found in woodland and scrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
