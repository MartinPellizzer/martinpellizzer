<p>Lycium aciculare, commonly known as the needleleaf boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, acicular (needle-like) leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Lycium aciculare plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
