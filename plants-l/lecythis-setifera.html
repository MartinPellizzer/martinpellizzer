<p>Lecythis setifera, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The tree produces a heavy, oily fruit with a hard, woody shell that encases a sticky, amber-colored pulp.
