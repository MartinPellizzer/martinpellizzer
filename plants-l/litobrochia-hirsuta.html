                    <h1>Litobrochia hirsuta</h1>
<p>Litobrochia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy litobrochia, is a rare and elusive plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and small, inconspicuous leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of its Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
