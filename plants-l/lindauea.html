                    <h1>Lindauea</h1>
<p>Lindauea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Canary Islands and consists of only two recognized species, Lindauea canariensis and Lindauea lindheimeri. These plants are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. Lindauea species are typically found in rocky, coastal habitats and are adapted to the arid conditions of their native environment.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and unique appearance, they are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
