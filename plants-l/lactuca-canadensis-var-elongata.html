                    <h1>Lactuca canadensis var. elongata</h1>
<p>Lactuca canadensis var. elongata, commonly known as the Canadian lettuce or elongated lettuce, is a variant of the common lettuce species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are typically less bitter than those of the standard Lactuca canadensis. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed areas. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in a loose cluster, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The plant has been used historically for its edible leaves and has some medicinal properties attributed to its lactucin content.</p>
