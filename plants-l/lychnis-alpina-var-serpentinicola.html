                    <h1>Lychnis alpina var. serpentinicola</h1>
<p>Lychnis alpina var. serpentinicola, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often found on rocky slopes and alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while the stems are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, making it a resilient and specialized species.</p>
