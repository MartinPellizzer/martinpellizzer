                            <h1>Languas Tonrokuensis</h1>
<p>The Languas tonrokuensis is a rare and mysterious plant discovered in the remote highlands of Tonroku. It is known for its unique bioluminescent properties that glow faintly under moonlight. This plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing near ancient stone formations. Its leaves emit a soft blue light, which has led to local legends about its magical origins. Scientists are still studying its ecological role and potential medicinal uses.</p>
