                    <h1>Lycopodium inundatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium inundatum, commonly known as the water clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a mat on the ground. The plant produces sporophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear spores, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Lycopodium inundatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
