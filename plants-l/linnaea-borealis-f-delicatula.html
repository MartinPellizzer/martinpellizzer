                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. delicatula</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. delicatula, commonly known as the fragrant wintergreen, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique feature is the presence of a fragrant, lemon-scented oil in its leaves, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its more refined leaf structure and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical Linnaea borealis.</p>
