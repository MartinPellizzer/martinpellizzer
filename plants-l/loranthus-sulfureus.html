                    <h1>Loranthus sulfureus</h1>
<p>Loranthus sulfureus, commonly known as the golden sandalwood or yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found on trees such as mango and tamarind.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
