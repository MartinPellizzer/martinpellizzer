<p>Lysimachia mixta, commonly known as yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, bright yellow flowers clustered in spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Lysimachia mixta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
