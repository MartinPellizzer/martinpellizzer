<p>Lobivia hystrix, commonly known as the spiny lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Lobivia hystrix is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and unique aesthetic.</p>
