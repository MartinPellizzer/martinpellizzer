                    <h1>Loranthus mannii var. combretoides</h1>
<p>Loranthus mannii var. combretoides, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Combretum*.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead has flattened, scale-like structures that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are important for bird dispersal. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in both ecological interactions and traditional medicine in parts of Africa.</p>
