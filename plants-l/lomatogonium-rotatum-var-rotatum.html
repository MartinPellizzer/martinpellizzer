                    <h1>Lomatogonium rotatum var. rotatum</h1>
<p>Lomatogonium rotatum var. rotatum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, oval leaves with a rough texture, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Lomatogonium rotatum var. rotatum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>
