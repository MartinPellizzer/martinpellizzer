                    <h1>Lyroglossa grisebachii var. euglossa</h1>
<p>Lyroglossa grisebachii var. euglossa, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, primarily bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
