                    <h1>Leontodon incanus var. anomalus</h1>
<p>Leontodon incanus var. anomalus, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a rare and specialized plant species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. This variant is distinguished from the typical Leontodon incanus by its unique morphological features, including its flowering structure and leaf morphology. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
