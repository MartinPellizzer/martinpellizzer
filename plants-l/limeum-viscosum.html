<p>Limeum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky lime tree, is a unique plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, resinous sap, which gives it its common name and contributes to its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a yellowish or greenish hue, and it produces fruit that is somewhat similar in appearance to a lime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique properties, it has been studied for potential medicinal and industrial applications.</p>
