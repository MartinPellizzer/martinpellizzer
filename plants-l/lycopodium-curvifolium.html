                    <h1>Lycopodium curvifolium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium curvifolium, commonly known as the curl-leaf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodium curvifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage traces back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
