<p>Leptinella atrata subsp.</p>
<p>luteola, commonly known as the yellow-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
