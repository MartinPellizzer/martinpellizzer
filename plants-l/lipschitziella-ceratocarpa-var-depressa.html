                    <h1>Lipschitziella ceratocarpa var. depressa</h1>
<p>Lipschitziella ceratocarpa var. depressa, commonly known as the depressed horned shieldfern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms dense mats on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds, and the species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological specificity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and of conservation concern.</p>
