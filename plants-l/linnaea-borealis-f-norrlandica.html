<p>Linnaea borealis f. norrlandica, commonly known as the Norwegian twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to boreal and subarctic regions of northern Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its two small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>This rare form is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical Linnaea borealis.</p>
