                    <h1>Lepisorus macrosphaerus var. maximus</h1>
<p>Lepisorus macrosphaerus var. maximus, commonly known as the large-sphere wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces fertile spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden settings.</p>
