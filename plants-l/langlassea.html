                    <h1>Langlassea</h1>
<p>Langlassea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its elongated, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Langlassea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
