                    <h1>Lagenocarpus dioicus</h1>
<p>Lagenocarpus dioicus, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps. The plant has distinctive, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, with separate male and female flowers on different plants, a characteristic known as dioecy.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds, aiding in its propagation in wetland habitats.</p>
