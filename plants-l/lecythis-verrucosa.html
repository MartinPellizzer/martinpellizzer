                    <h1>Lecythis verrucosa</h1>
<p>Lecythis verrucosa, commonly known as the rubber tree or Brazilian rubber tree, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. Its latex, once a major source of natural rubber, is harvested from the bark.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and has historical significance in the rubber industry.</p>
