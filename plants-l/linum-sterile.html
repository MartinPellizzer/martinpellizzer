<p>Linum sterile, commonly known as the common flax, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Linum sterile is often cultivated for its fiber, which is used in the production of linen.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically grown for its seeds, as it is sterile and does not produce viable offspring.</p>
