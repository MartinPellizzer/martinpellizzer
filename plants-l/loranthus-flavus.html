                    <h1>Loranthus flavus</h1>
<p>Loranthus flavus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and its berries are typically orange or red, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal. Loranthus flavus is native to Australia and is an important part of the ecosystem, supporting various insect and bird species.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategies make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
