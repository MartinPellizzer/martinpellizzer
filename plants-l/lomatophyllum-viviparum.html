<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. It is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This unique trait aids in its propagation and adaptation to its natural habitat.</p>
