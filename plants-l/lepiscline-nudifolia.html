                    <h1>Lepiscline nudifolia</h1>
<p>Lepiscline nudifolia, commonly known as the nakedleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its lack of leaves on its stems, which are instead covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria, while still performing some photosynthesis with its small green stems. It produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
