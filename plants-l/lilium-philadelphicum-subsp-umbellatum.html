<p>Lilium philadelphicum subsp.</p>
<p>umbellatum, commonly known as the umbellate lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink, often with a red or purple throat.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has strap-like, grassy leaves. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive winter dormancy.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its umbel-like arrangement of flowers, which sets it apart from other lily species.</p>
