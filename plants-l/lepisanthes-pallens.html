                    <h1>Lepisanthes pallens</h1>
<p>Lepisanthes pallens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate, waxy petals that emit a faint fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lepisanthes pallens is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
