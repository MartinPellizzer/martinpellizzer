<p>Lipocarpha debilis, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water areas, and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist environment.</p>
<p>Lipocarpha debilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
