                    <h1>Loranthus conduplicatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus conduplicatus, commonly known as the double-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers, followed by fleshy, orange berries that contain sticky seeds. Its leaves are usually paired, hence the name "double-leaf," and they are often covered in a waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>Loranthus conduplicatus plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, while also impacting the growth of its host trees.</p>
