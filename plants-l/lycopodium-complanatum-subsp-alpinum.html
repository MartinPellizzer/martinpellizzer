<p>Lycopodium complanatum subsp.</p>
<p>alpinum, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant features closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. It produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its foliage, which are characteristic of the lycophyte group.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
