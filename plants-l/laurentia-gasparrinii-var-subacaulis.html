<p>Laurentia gasparrinii var. subacaulis, commonly known as the slender laurentia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its ability to survive in harsh, alpine conditions with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
