                    <h1>Lindsaea repens var. sessilis</h1>
<p>Lindsaea repens var. sessilis, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground and produce clusters of small, delicate fronds. The fronds are typically linear to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its role in spore dispersal.</p>
