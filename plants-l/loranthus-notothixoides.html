                    <h1>Loranthus notothixoides</h1>
<p>Loranthus notothixoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while performing photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain adhesive seeds. Its growth is often limited to specific regions in India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
