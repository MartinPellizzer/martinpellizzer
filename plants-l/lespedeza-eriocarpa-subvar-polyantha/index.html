                            <h1>Lespedeza Eriocarpa Subvar. Polyantha</h1>
<p>Lespedeza eriocarpa subvar. polyantha is a lesser-known yet fascinating member of the legume family, known for its delicate foliage and vibrant floral display. This subvariety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas across eastern North America. Its small, clustered flowers range from pale pink to soft lavender, adding subtle beauty to the landscape. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Its resilience and adaptability make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
