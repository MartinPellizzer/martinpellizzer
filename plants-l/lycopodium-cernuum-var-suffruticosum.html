                    <h1>Lycopodium cernuum var. suffruticosum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium cernuum var. suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing mats of foliage with small, scale-like leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems.</p>
