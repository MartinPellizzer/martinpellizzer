                    <h1>Loranthus lunduensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus lunduensis, commonly known as the Lunda mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries like Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genera Terminalia and Combretum, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses its seeds through bird droppings, aiding in its spread across forest canopies.</p>
