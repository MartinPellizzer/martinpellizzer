                    <h1>Logfia arizonica</h1>
<p>Logfia arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona logfia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Logfia arizonica is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
