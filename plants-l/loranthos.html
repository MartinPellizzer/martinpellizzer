                    <h1>Loranthos</h1>
<p>Loranthos, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems, which are embedded into the host plant. Loranthos produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This plant has a long history of cultural significance, particularly in holiday traditions.</p>
