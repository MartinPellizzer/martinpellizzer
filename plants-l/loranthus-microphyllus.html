                    <h1>Loranthus microphyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia and typically grows on eucalyptus and other native trees. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by fleshy, red berries. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique adaptations make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
