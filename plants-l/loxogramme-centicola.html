<p>Loxogramme centicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, rounded lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate.</p>
<p>Loxogramme centicola plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
