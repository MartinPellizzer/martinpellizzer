<p>Lankesterella spannageliana, commonly known as the Spanish liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a central axis and leaf-like structures called phyllodes that are arranged in a spiral pattern. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the thallus.</p>
<p>Lankesterella spannageliana is often used in ecological studies to assess the health of humid, temperate ecosystems.</p>
