                    <h1>Leucothoe multiflora var. pohlii</h1>
<p>Leucothoe multiflora var. pohlii, commonly known as the Appalachian leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and dark green, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by bright red,浆果-like berries in the autumn. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
