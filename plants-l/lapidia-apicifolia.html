                    <h1>Lapidia apicifolia</h1>
<p>Lapidia apicifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leafed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically green to yellow-green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
