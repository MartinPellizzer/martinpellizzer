                    <h1>Loranthus rufidulus</h1>
<p>Loranthus rufidulus, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Loranthus rufidulus is often found in humid, shaded environments, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
