                    <h1>Lachnopylis mannii</h1>
<p>Lachnopylis mannii, commonly known as the manna lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which often has a powdery coating of wax. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
