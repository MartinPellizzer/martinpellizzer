<p>Larrea tridentata, commonly known as creosote bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss through a waxy coating and small size.</p>
<p>The creosote bush plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
