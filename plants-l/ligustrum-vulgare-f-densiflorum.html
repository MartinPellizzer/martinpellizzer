<p>Ligustrum vulgare f. densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower privet, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, black berries. It is often cultivated as a hedge or ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
