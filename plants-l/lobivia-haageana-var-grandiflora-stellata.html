<p>Lobivia haageana var. grandiflora-stellata, commonly known as the Stellate Lobivia, is a compact, mat-forming cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features short, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with small, spiny areoles. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often star-shaped, giving it its common name. It is well adapted to drought and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
