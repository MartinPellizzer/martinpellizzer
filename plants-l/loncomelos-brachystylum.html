                    <h1>Loncomelos brachystylum</h1>
<p>Loncomelos brachystylum, commonly known as the short-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, sticky berries. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus *Bauhinia*, through its haustellum, which allows it to extract water and nutrients. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clusters on branches, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
