                    <h1>Loranthus senegalensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the savanna regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
