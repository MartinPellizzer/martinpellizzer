                    <h1>Lumnitzera carnosa</h1>
<p>Lumnitzera carnosa, commonly known as mangrove apple or sea apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in mangrove swamps and estuaries. The plant has pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by edible berries that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The species plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystem stability by preventing erosion and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial life.</p>
