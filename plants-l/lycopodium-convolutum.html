                    <h1>Lycopodium convolutum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium convolutum, commonly known as the twisted clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobili.</p>
<p>It is a primitive vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping or upright growth habit, with stems that can be either prostrate or ascending. Its sporophyte stage is dominant, and it produces spores in specialized cones rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Lycopodium convolutum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
