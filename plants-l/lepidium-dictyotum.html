                    <h1>Lepidium dictyotum</h1>
<p>Lepidium dictyotum, commonly known as the clustered cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, calcareous soils in grasslands and woodland edges. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the tiny, angular seeds.</p>
<p>Lepidium dictyotum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
