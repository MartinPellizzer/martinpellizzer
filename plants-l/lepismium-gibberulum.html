                    <h1>Lepismium gibberulum</h1>
<p>Lepismium gibberulum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lepismium gibberulum is considered an endangered species.</p>
