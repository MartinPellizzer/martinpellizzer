<p>Lycium scoparium lusus affine, commonly known as the silverberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is closely related to other species in the Lycium genus.</p>
