                    <h1>Lindsaea andamanica</h1>
<p>Lindsaea andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lindsaeaceae and is characterized by its small, linear leaves and delicate, white or pale green flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows on the branches of trees, forming dense clusters that can resemble miniature shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
