                            <h1>Lathyrus Cyaneus Subsp. Digitatus</h1>
<p>Blue-flowered vetch, scientifically known as Lathyrus cyaneus subsp. digitatus, is a striking member of the legume family native to parts of Europe and western Asia. This plant is celebrated for its vivid blue blooms that appear in late spring, adding a splash of color to meadows and woodland edges. Its unique flower structure, with spurred petals and a delicate appearance, makes it a favorite among pollinators like bees and butterflies. While it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, it also shows adaptability to a range of environmental conditions. Due to its beauty and ecological value, it is increasingly recognized in both horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
