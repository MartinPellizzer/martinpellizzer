                    <h1>Loranthus braunii var. descampsii</h1>
<p>Loranthus braunii var. descampsii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species is native to southern Africa and is often found in savanna and woodland ecosystems.</p>
