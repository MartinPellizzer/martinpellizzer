<p>Lycopus lucidus var. genuinus, commonly known as American water-hemlock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks, wetlands, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of cicutoxin, making it dangerous to livestock and humans.</p>
