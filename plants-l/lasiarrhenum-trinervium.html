<p>Lasiarrhenum trinervium, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, which are released when the spore cases mature.</p>
