<p>Leptospermum scoparium var. parvum, commonly known as the small-flowered manuka, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces a distinctive honey-like resin, which is used in various traditional and commercial applications. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the more widely known manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) but is distinguished by its smaller flowers and growth form.</p>
