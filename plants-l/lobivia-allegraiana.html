                    <h1>Lobivia allegraiana</h1>
<p>Lobivia allegraiana, commonly known as the Allegra's lobivia, is a compact, flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts.</p>
