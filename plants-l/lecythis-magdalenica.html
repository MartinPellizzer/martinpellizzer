<p>Lecythis magdalenica, commonly known as the Magdalena lecyth, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces a distinctive, heavy, woody fruit. The fruit contains a sweet, starchy pulp that is sometimes used in local cuisine. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces threats to its survival in the wild.</p>
