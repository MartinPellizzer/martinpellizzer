                    <h1>Lachnopylis sambesina</h1>
<p>Lachnopylis sambesina, commonly known as the coastal lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, which means it is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This species is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong winds, making it a pioneer species in harsh coastal ecosystems. Its morphology includes a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Lachnopylis sambesina plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
