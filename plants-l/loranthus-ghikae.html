                    <h1>Loranthus ghikae</h1>
<p>Loranthus ghikae, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and has a unique structure with a stemless body and a cluster of leaves at the base. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive some of its nutrients from the host plant, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded environments at higher elevations.</p>
