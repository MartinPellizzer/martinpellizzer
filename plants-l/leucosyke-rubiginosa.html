                    <h1>Leucosyke rubiginosa</h1>
<p>Leucosyke rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stained lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown to black thallus, which often appears crusty or foliose in texture. The lichen contains various secondary metabolites, including usnic acid, which contributes to its chemical complexity. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
