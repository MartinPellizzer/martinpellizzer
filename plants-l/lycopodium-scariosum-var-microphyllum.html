                    <h1>Lycopodium scariosum var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium scariosum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved clubmoss, is a diminutive evergreen fern ally characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Native to moist, shaded environments, it thrives in rocky or forested areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain understory ecosystems.</p>
