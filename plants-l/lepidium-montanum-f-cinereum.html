<p>Lepidium montanum f. cinereum, commonly known as the dark-leaved peppergrass, is a variant of the mountain peppergrass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, elongated seed pods. Its botanical features make it well adapted to rocky and arid environments, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>The dark foliage of this form is a distinguishing trait that sets it apart from other varieties of Lepidium montanum.</p>
