                    <h1>Lathraea miqueliana</h1>
<p>Lathraea miqueliana, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a rare and unique parasitic plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a short, fleshy stem with a single, umbrella-like flower that blooms in late summer. It is often found growing on the roots of other plants, particularly those in the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in the botanical world.</p>
