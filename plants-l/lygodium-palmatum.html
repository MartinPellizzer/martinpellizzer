<p>Lygodium palmatum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds and a unique ability to climb using its rhizomes and stolons. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Lygodium palmatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various forest organisms.</p>
