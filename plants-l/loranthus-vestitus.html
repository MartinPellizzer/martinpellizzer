                    <h1>Loranthus vestitus</h1>
<p>Loranthus vestitus, commonly known as the naked or false mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that reduce its surface area, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients from the host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, fleshy berries containing sticky seeds. Its parasitic nature means it can weaken its host if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific host requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
