                    <h1>Lycopodium spurium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium spurium, commonly known as the ground pine, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that resemble pine needles.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from cone-like structures called strobili. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Lycopodium spurium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats.</p>
