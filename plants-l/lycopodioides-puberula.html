<p>Lycopodioides puberula, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporophytes at the tips of its stems. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Lycopodioides puberula plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
