<p>Lycomormium cerinum, commonly known as the candleplant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical, candle-like stem covered in a waxy, white coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Lycomormium cerinum is often cultivated for its unusual appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
