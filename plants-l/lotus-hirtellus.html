<p>Lotus hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots form dense mats that stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetlands.</p>
<p>Lotus hirtellus is often found in shallow ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
