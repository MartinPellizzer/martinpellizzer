<p>Lagenandra meeboldii, commonly known as the Meebold's lichen, is a rare and unique species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to greenish thallus with a distinct, granular texture. This lichen typically grows on bark and rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lagenandra meeboldii is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
