                    <h1>Loranthus lepidophyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus lepidophyllus, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a parasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is unique for its ability to survive extreme dehydration by curling into a compact, desiccated state, which allows it to remain dormant for long periods. When water becomes available, it "resurrects" by rapidly rehydrating and regaining its green, leafy appearance.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include small, scale-like leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
