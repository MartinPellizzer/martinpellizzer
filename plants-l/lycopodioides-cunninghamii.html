<p>Lycopodioides cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rainforest understoreys.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
