<p>Ludwigia permollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Ludwigia permollis thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a popular choice for pond gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate and ability to tolerate a range of water conditions contribute to its ecological and ornamental value.</p>
