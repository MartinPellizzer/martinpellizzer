<p>Loranthus quinquenervius, commonly known as the five-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a woody stem and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's leaves are opposite, ovate, and have five distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Loranthus quinquenervius plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
