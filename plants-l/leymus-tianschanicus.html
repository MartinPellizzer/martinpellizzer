                    <h1>Leymus tianschanicus</h1>
<p>Leymus tianschanicus, commonly known as the Tian Shan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Tian Shan range.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a common component of alpine and steppe vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
