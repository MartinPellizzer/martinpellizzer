                    <h1>Leptobalanus sparsipilis</h1>
<p>Leptobalanus sparsipilis, commonly known as the sparse-hair pine, is a rare coniferous species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and a conical shape, typical of many pine species. The plant produces small, clustered cones that mature to release winged seeds for wind dispersal. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, sparse layer of hair, which gives it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
