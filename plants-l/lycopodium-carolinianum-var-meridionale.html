                    <h1>Lycopodium carolinianum var. meridionale</h1>
<p>Lycopodium carolinianum var. meridionale, commonly known as the southern clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its spirally arranged, scale-like leaves and the presence of strobila, which are spore-producing structures. This variety is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of ancient plant groups.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to its specific ecological niche.</p>
