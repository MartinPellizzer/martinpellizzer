<p>Luzula sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Luzula sudetica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
