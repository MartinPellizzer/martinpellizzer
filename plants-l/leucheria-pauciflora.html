                    <h1>Leucheria pauciflora</h1>
<p>Leucheria pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered leucheria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucheria pauciflora is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
