<p>Lepanthes valerioi, commonly known as the Valerio's slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of forests. The plant is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that are often pale green or white with intricate patterns. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes valerioi is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
