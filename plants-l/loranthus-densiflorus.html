                    <h1>Loranthus densiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus densiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white or pale yellow berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
