                    <h1>Loranthus regularis</h1>
<p>Loranthus regularis, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense groups. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds and facilitate dispersal.</p>
<p>Loranthus regularis is found in various regions of the world, including Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
