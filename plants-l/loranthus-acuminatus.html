                    <h1>Loranthus acuminatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus acuminatus, commonly known as the acuminated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus acuminatus is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
