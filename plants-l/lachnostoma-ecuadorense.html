                    <h1>Lachnostoma ecuadorense</h1>
<p>Lachnostoma ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lachnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to its substrate. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is primarily found in the humid forests of Ecuador, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
