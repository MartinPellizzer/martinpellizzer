                    <h1>Lachnostoma hastulatum</h1>
<p>Lachnostoma hastulatum, commonly known as the arrowhead lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a pale to dark green thallus with a distinctive arrowhead-shaped lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
