                    <h1>Loranthus pallideviridis</h1>
<p>Loranthus pallideviridis, commonly known as the pale green mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalyptus and acacia, and derives its nutrients through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
