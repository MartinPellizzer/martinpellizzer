<p>Luisia diglipurensis, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming a unique epiphytic relationship with its host. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, misty environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Luisia diglipurensis is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
