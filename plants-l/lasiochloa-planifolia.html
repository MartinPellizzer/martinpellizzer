                    <h1>Lasiochloa planifolia</h1>
<p>Lasiochloa planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf hairgrass, is a species of grass native to the wetlands and marshes of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, flat leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with standing water.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens and restoration projects.</p>
