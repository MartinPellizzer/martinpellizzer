<p>Lobivia cruciaureispina, commonly known as the Cruciate Spine Lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of spiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Lobivia cruciaureispina is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
