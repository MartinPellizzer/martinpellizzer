                    <h1>Loranthus acutifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus acutifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves, which are modified for this purpose. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a leathery texture, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Loranthus acutifolius plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, and its presence can indicate the health of the host tree.</p>
