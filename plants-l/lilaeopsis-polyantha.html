<p>Lilaeopsis polyantha, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Lilaeopsis polyantha thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these environments.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and early blooming make it an important plant for pollinators and an indicator of wetland health.</p>
