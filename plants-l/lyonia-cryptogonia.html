                    <h1>Lyonia cryptogonia</h1>
<p>Lyonia cryptogonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, white to pale green flowers with a unique, spiral-like arrangement of petals and sepals. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
