<p>Lepturus aciculatus, commonly known as the slender leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, finely branched structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides photosynthetic capabilities. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and sensitivity to air pollution make it an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
