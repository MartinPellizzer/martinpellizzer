                    <h1>Lithocardium greggii</h1>
<p>Lithocardium greggii, commonly known as Gregg's lithocardium, is a rare and small shrub native to the Chihuahuan Desert in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
