                    <h1>Lithocardium mariquitense</h1>
<p>Lithocardium mariquitense, commonly known as the Mariquitense rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone areas, which provide the specific mineral conditions it requires. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single flower spike that emerges from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lithocardium mariquitense is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
