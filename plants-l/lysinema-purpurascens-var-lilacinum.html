                    <h1>Lysinema purpurascens var. lilacinum</h1>
<p>Lysinema purpurascens var. lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac-flowered lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a leathery, pale green to reddish upper surface and a white to pale yellow lower surface. The thallus is composed of a complex network of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form the lichen's symbiotic structure. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its lilac-colored lobes, which give it its common name.</p>
