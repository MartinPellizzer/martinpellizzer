                    <h1>Leptactina benguelensis</h1>
<p>Leptactina benguelensis, commonly known as the Benguela thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and savannas, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Leptactina benguelensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range.</p>
