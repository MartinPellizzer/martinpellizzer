<p>Larix pumila, commonly known as the tamarack or larch, is a deciduous conifer native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden and fall off in autumn, distinguishing it from evergreen conifers. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds surrounded by winged bracts. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Larix pumila typically grows in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy areas.</p>
