                    <h1>Leersia gracilis</h1>
<p>Leersia gracilis, commonly known as slender leersia, is a perennial grass native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Leersia gracilis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
