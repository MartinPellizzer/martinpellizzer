<p>Lycopodium dendroideum, commonly known as the tree clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that resemble small trees, hence its common name. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of ancient seedless plants. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>Lycopodium dendroideum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
