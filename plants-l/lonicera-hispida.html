<p>Lonicera hispida, commonly known as rough honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red and edible, though they are usually consumed by birds rather than humans.</p>
<p>Lonicera hispida is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
