                    <h1>Lasiocroton gracilis</h1>
<p>Lasiocroton gracilis, commonly known as the slender leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as Euphorbiaceae species, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
