                    <h1>Lycopodium arunachalense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium arunachalense, commonly known as the Arunachal lycopod, is a species of clubmoss native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, typical of many lycophytes. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the tips of its stems, a feature common among members of the Lycopodiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
