                    <h1>Launaea fragilis var. pumila</h1>
<p>Launaea fragilis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf launaea, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in inflorescences at the stem tips. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against intense sunlight and water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
