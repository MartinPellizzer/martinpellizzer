                    <h1>Lisianthius uliginosus</h1>
<p>Lisianthius uliginosus, commonly known as the swamp lisianthius, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to water-saturated soils, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of wetland ecosystems.</p>
