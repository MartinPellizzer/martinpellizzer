<p>Leucanthemopsis alpina var. pseudotomentosa, commonly known as the alpine leucanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are densely covered with fine, white pubescence. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow-orange disk in the center, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
