The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
