                    <h1>Laphangium luteoalbum</h1>
<p>Laphangium luteoalbum, commonly known as the golden-white lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-white thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form, adhering tightly to its substrate. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
