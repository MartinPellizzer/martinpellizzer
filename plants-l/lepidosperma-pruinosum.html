<p>Lepidosperma pruinosum, commonly known as the glossy sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, shiny coating, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Lepidosperma pruinosum is an important component of the ecological diversity in its native wetlands.</p>
