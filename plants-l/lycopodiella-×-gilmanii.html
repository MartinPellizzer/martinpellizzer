                    <h1>Lycopodiella × gilmanii</h1>
<p>Lycopodiella × gilmanii, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Lycopodiella cernua and Lycopodiella varia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant with a dense, mat-like structure that forms a carpet on the forest floor. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Lycopodiella × gilmanii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant hybridization and evolutionary adaptations.</p>
