                <h1>Ledebouria ensifolia</h1>
<p>Ledebouria ensifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and a rosette of long, sword-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
