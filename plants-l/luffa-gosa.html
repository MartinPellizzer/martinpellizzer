                    <h1>Luffa gosa</h1>
<p>Luffa gosa, commonly known as sponge gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, fibrous stem that becomes spongy and lightweight when mature. The plant produces large, lobed leaves and yellow flowers, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. The fruit's inner pulp dries to form a spongy structure used for scrubbing.</p>
<p>Luffa gosa is cultivated for its fibrous interior, which is harvested before it fully matures.</p>
