<p>Libanotis pyrenaica var. libanotis, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
