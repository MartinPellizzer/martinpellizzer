                    <h1>Liesneria faveolata</h1>
<p>Liesneria faveolata, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its striking clusters of bright yellow to orange spore-bearing structures called soruses. The plant's leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitats. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation with proper care.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific environmental needs, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
