<p>Litobrochia pseudolonchitis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. The plant forms a crust-like growth on stone surfaces, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh climates. It is often found in Mediterranean and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in ecological succession.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is considered an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
