                    <h1>Lemna turionifera</h1>
<p>Lemna turionifera, commonly known as the floating shield fern, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like structure of tiny, broad, oval leaves that float on the water surface. The plant reproduces both vegetatively through the production of turions, which are compact, dormant buds, and sexually via sporocarps. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
