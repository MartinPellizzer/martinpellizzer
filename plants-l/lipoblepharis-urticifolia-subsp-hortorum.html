<p>Lipoblepharis urticifolia subsp.</p>
<p>hortorum, commonly known as the garden lipoblepharis, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its glandular, hairy leaves that often emit a mild irritant when touched, a feature that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative plant in dry environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies hortorum is distinguished by its more compact form and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical species.</p>
