<p>Lobivia jajoana var. paucicostata, commonly known as the narrow-costed lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and adaptability to rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
