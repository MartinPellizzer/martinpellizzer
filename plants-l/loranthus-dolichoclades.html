                    <h1>Loranthus dolichoclades</h1>
<p>Loranthus dolichoclades, commonly known as the long-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of white or yellow flowers. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
