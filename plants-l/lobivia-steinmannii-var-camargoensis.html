<p>Lobivia steinmannii var. camargoensis, commonly known as the Camargo's lobivia, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded body and spiny, ribbed stems that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, adding a splash of color to its desert habitat. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
