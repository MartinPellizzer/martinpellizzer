                    <h1>Lobivia wegheiana</h1>
<p>Lobivia wegheiana, commonly known as the Wegehain's lobivia, is a succulent plant native to South America, specifically Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Lobivia wegheiana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
