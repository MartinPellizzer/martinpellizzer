                    <h1>Lobelia lucayana</h1>
<p>Lobelia lucayana, commonly known as the Lucayan lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or sandy habitats. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions.</p>
