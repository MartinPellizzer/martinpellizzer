                    <h1>Luffa drastica</h1>
<p>Luffa drastica, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, ridged stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that give way to elongated, sponge-like fruits. The fruit's interior becomes spongy and fibrous as it matures, making it useful for scrubbing.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for both ornamental and practical purposes in warm climates.</p>
