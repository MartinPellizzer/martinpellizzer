<p>Lepidagathis calycina, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a robust, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish or reddish, and they appear in spikes during the wet season.</p>
<p>Lepidagathis calycina is often found in wetlands, marshes, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
