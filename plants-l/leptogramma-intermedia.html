                    <h1>Leptogramma intermedia</h1>
<p>Leptogramma intermedia, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
