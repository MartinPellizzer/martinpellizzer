                    <h1>Lachnastoma crassifolium</h1>
<p>Lachnastoma crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant's thallus is composed of a complex interwoven network of fungal hyphae and algal cells. It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
