<p>Leptopus nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while its leaves provide shade and habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Leptopus nepalensis plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetlands.</p>
