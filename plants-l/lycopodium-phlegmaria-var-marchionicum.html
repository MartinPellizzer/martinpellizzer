                    <h1>Lycopodium phlegmaria var. marchionicum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium phlegmaria var. marchionicum, commonly known as the Marchioness's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. Native to the wet, shaded environments of temperate regions, it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
