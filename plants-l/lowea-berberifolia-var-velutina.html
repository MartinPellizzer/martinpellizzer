<p>Lowea berberifolia var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet-leafed barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its varietal name. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. It produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not widely cultivated.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a hedge due to its hardy nature.</p>
