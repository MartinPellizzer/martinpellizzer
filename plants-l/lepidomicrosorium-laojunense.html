<p>Lepidomicrosorium laojunense, commonly known as the Laojun Mountains moss, is a rare and endemic species of liverwort found in the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain.</p>
