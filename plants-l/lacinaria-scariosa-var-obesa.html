                    <h1>Lacinaria scariosa var. obesa</h1>
<p>Lacinaria scariosa var. obesa, commonly known as the swollen bladderwrack, is a variant of the bladderwrack species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is a brown seaweed characterized by its thick, fleshy, and inflated thallus, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it attaches to rocky substrates using a holdfast. Its structure consists of a central stipe with broad, lobed blades that are often covered in a leathery, scaly layer.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ability to retain water, which helps it survive in fluctuating tidal conditions.</p>
