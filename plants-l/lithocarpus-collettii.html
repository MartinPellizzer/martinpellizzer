                    <h1>Lithocarpus collettii</h1>
<p>Lithocarpus collettii, commonly known as the Collett's ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts.</p>
<p>It is a broadleaf evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Its leaves are typically革质 (leathery) and elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, inedible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which contribute to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
