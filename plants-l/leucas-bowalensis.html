                    <h1>Leucas bowalensis</h1>
<p>Leucas bowalensis, commonly known as the Bowalensis ironwood, is a rare and endemic shrub found in the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and woody stems that provide structural support in its moist, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in the humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucas bowalensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
