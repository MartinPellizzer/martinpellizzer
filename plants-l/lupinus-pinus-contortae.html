<p>Lupinus pinus-contortae, commonly known as the twisted pine lupine, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to specific regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive appearance, featuring twisted, pine-like stems and clusters of purple or pink pea-shaped flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Lupinus pinus-contortae thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as mountain slopes and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
