                    <h1>Loranthus subcampestris</h1>
<p>Loranthus subcampestris, commonly known as the field mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is found in various parts of Europe and is often associated with open woodlands and hedgerows.</p>
