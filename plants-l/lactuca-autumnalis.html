                    <h1>Lactuca autumnalis</h1>
<p>Lactuca autumnalis, commonly known as autumn lettuce, is a species of lettuce native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its loose, headless leaves that are typically smaller and more delicate than those of iceberg or romaine lettuce. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by slender, cylindrical seed pods. Its leaves are often used in salads or as a garnish due to their mild, slightly sweet flavor.</p>
<p>Lactuca autumnalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
