                    <h1>Leptorumohra mutica</h1>
<p>Leptorumohra mutica, commonly known as the slender leathery fern, is a species of fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often clustered together. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
