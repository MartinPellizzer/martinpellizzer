                    <h1>Lechea san-sabeana</h1>
<p>Lechea san-sabeana, commonly known as the San Sabean milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Lechea san-sabeana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is part of the Asclepiadaceae family, known for its milkweed species.</p>
