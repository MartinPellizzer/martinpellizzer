<p>Lobostemon pubiflorus, commonly known as the hairy-flowered lobostemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in terminal inflorescences. Its flowering period usually occurs during the wet season, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native habitat.</p>
