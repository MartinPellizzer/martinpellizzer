<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy leaves that help it survive in harsh, rocky environments. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
