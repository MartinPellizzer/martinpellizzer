<p>Lasiococca, commonly known as the silky tamarisk, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Tamaricaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of shrubs or small trees characterized by their dense, woolly foliage that gives them a soft, silvery appearance. The leaves are typically opposite and have a glandular surface, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. The flowers are small and clustered, often in spikes, and are usually pale green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Lasiococca species are native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, where they thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
