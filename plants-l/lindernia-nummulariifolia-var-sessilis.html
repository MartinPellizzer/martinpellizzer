                    <h1>Lindernia nummulariifolia var. sessilis</h1>
<p>Lindernia nummulariifolia var. sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, round to oval-shaped leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pale purple to pink in color, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
