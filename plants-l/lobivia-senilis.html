                    <h1>Lobivia senilis</h1>
<p>Lobivia senilis, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a slow-growing, compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a globular or cylindrical shape with a distinctive silver-green coloration due to its dense covering of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its textured foliage. Lobivia senilis is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance.</p>
