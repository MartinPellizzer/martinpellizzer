                    <h1>Lithocardium sprucei</h1>
<p>Lithocardium sprucei, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in harsh, rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, a composite organism formed from a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This species is often found on bare rock surfaces, where it can tolerate extreme conditions such as desiccation and high UV exposure. Its structure is typically crust-like, allowing it to adhere tightly to the substrate.</p>
<p>Lithocardium sprucei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in arid or mountainous regions.</p>
