                    <h1>Lemurangis humilis</h1>
<p>Lemurangis humilis, commonly known as the lowly lemurangis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the humid understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that emit a faintly fragrant scent, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and small bees. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moisture, aiding in its survival in high humidity environments. Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the rich, decomposing leaf litter.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Lemurangis humilis is considered endangered and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
