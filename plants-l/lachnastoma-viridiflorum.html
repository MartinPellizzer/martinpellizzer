                    <h1>Lachnastoma viridiflorum</h1>
<p>Lachnastoma viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered lichen, is a unique member of the Lecanoromycetes class.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish in color due to the presence of chlorophyll. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which contributes to its photosynthetic capabilities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces.</p>
<p>Its morphology and ecological niche make it an important indicator species for certain forest ecosystems.</p>
