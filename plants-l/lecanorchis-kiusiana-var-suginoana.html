                    <h1>Lecanorchis kiusiana var. suginoana</h1>
<p>Lecanorchis kiusiana var. suginoana, commonly known as the Sugino's ghost orchid, is a rare and highly specialized orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on the bark of trees in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces delicate, pale pink or white flowers with a unique, ghostly appearance, which contributes to its common name. It has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, relying on them for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
