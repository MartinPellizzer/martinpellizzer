                    <h1>Lycopodium crassum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium crassum, commonly known as the club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a root system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Lycopodium crassum typically grows in dense mats, forming a ground cover in forest floors or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
