                    <h1>Loranthus poissonii</h1>
<p>Loranthus poissonii, commonly known as the Poissonâ€™s mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful.</p>
