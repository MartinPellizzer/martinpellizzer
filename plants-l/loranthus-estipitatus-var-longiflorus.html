                    <h1>Loranthus estipitatus var. longiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus estipitatus var. longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced leaves and a reliance on host plants for nutrients.</p>
