<p>Lachnagrostis phleoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters wide, giving it a delicate appearance. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences.</p>
