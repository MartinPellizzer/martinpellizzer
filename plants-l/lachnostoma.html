                    <h1>Lachnostoma</h1>
<p>Lachnostoma, commonly known as the "false lichen" or "stinkhorn fungus," is a genus of fungi rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>However, it is often mistaken for lichens due to its appearance. These fungi are typically found on decaying wood or soil and play a role in decomposition. They are characterized by their unique, often foul-smelling spore masses.</p>
<p>Despite their fungal nature, they are sometimes studied in ecological contexts for their role in nutrient cycling.</p>
