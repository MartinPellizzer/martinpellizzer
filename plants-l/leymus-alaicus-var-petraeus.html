                    <h1>Leymus alaicus var. petraeus</h1>
<p>Leymus alaicus var. petraeus, commonly known as the rock wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil on steep slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for erosion control and as a forage plant in arid regions.</p>
