                    <h1>Latreillea linearis</h1>
<p>Latreillea linearis, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a thin, leaf-like structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It lacks distinct rhizines but has a well-developed medulla.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
