<p>Lycium scoparium var. calycinum, commonly known as the silverleaf lycium, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to xerophytic conditions, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
