                    <h1>Lemna javanica</h1>
<p>Lemna javanica, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Alismatales and is characterized by its rosette-like structure of tiny, broad leaves. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually via vegetative propagation, making it highly adaptable.</p>
<p>Lemna javanica is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
