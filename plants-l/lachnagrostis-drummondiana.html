<p>Lachnagrostis drummondiana, commonly known as Drummond's bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, blue-green blades that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and dry meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
