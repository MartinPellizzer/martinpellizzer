<p>Lomagramma tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian lomagramma, is a species of fern native to the islands of Tahiti and Moorea in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a compact, fan-like structure.</p>
<p>Lomagramma tahitensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
