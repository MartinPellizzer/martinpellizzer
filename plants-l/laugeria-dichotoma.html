<p>Laugeria dichotoma, commonly known as the forked laugeria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Laugeria dichotoma produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
