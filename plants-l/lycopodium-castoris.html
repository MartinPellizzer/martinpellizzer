<p>Lycopodium castoris, commonly known as the castor tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Africa, India, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots and stems contain a toxic compound called cycasin, which has been historically used in poison arrows.</p>
<p>The castor tree is also valued for its oil derived from its seeds, which has various industrial and medicinal applications.</p>
