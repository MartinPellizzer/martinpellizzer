                    <h1>Loranthus venosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus venosus, commonly known as the veiny mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dark green, waxy leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that releases sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of potential host trees.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and riverine forests.</p>
