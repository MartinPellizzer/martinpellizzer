<p>Lepidoneuron punctulatum, commonly known as the spotted liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dorsiventral thallus, which is usually green and covered with small, rounded papillae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporophytes, are borne on short stalks near the thallus surface.</p>
<p>Lepidoneuron punctulatum is an important component of bryophyte communities and serves as an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
