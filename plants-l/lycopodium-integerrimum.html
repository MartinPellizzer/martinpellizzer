<p>Lycopodium integerrimum, commonly known as the stiff clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical structures. Lycopodium integerrimum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
