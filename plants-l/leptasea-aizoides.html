<p>Leptasea aizoides, commonly known as the Aizoides fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Leptasea aizoides is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
