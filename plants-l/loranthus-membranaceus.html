                    <h1>Loranthus membranaceus</h1>
<p>Loranthus membranaceus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily eucalyptus and other angiosperms.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that contain sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of trees when dropped. It plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both a beneficial and potentially harmful species.</p>
