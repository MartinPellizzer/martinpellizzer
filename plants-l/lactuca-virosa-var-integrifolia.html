<p>Lactuca virosa var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf bitter lettuce, is a wild species of lettuce native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, green flowers arranged in a loose cluster, and its seeds are small and oval-shaped. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>While not typically cultivated for food, it has been used historically in some regions for its slightly bitter taste and medicinal properties.</p>
