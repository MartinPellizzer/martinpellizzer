                    <h1>Ligeophila misera</h1>
<p>Ligeophila misera, commonly known as the sad lichen, is a rare and specialized species of lichen that thrives in extremely moist and shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its delicate, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to surfaces such as bark or rock. The plant's morphology includes a complex network of fungal hyphae intertwined with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. Ligeophila misera is typically found in temperate rainforests, where high humidity and cool temperatures support its growth.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health and is often used in ecological assessments.</p>
