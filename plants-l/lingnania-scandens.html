<p>Lingnania scandens, commonly known as the climbing mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, opposite leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant relies on its host for nutrients and water, often causing stress to the host tree. Its berries are bright red and are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Lingnania scandens plays a unique role in forest ecosystems as both a parasite and a contributor to biodiversity.</p>
