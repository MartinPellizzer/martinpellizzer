<p>Leptosaccharum filiforme, commonly known as the slender leathery grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
