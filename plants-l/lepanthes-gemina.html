<p>Lepanthes gemina, commonly known as the twin orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in capturing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Lepanthes gemina is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests.</p>
