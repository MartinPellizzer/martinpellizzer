                    <h1>Leopoldia eburnea</h1>
<p>Leopoldia eburnea, commonly known as the white leopoldia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking contrast to its showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
