                    <h1>Lathyrus vestitus var. multiflorus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus vestitus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports. The plant features pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, and it is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>The variety multiflorus is distinguished by its increased floral display compared to the typical form.</p>
