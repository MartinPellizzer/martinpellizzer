                    <h1>Lycopodium radicatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium radicatum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that forms dense mats of needle-like leaves, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. Lycopodium radicatum is characterized by its lack of true roots, instead having root-like structures called rhizomes that help anchor it in soil.</p>
<p>This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
