<p>Lupinus hortonianus, commonly known as the Horton's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Lupinus hortonianus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
