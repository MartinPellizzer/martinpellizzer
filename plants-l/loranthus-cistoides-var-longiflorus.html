                    <h1>Loranthus cistoides var. longiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus cistoides var. longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually scale-like and appear in pairs along the stems.</p>
<p>This variety is native to regions in Africa and is often found growing on acacia and other woody plants.</p>
