                    <h1>Lotononis cytisoides var. sericea</h1>
<p>Lotononis cytisoides var. sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf lotononis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
