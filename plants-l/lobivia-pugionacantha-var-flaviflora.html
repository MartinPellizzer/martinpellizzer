                    <h1>Lobivia pugionacantha var. flaviflora</h1>
<p>Lobivia pugionacantha var. flaviflora, commonly known as the Yellow-flowered Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical stems covered in white to grayish spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne on short pedicels at the stem tips. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil surface.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in dry, well-drained environments.</p>
