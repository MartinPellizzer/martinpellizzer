                    <h1>Lannea somalensis</h1>
<p>Lannea somalensis, commonly known as the Somali ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the dry regions of Somalia and southern Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been heavily exploited, leading to its decline in natural habitats.</p>
