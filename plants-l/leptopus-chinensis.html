<p>Leptopus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Leptopus chinensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance.</p>
