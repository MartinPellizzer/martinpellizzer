<p>Lycopodium duidae, commonly known as the Duidae clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>

The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage, it provides insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
