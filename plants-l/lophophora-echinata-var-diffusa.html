                    <h1>Lophophora echinata var. diffusa</h1>
<p>Lophophora echinata var. diffusa, commonly known as the Diffuse Peyote, is a cacti species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a short, thick stem that produces clusters of small, white flowers. The plant contains mescaline, a psychoactive alkaloid, making it significant in both traditional and modern contexts. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, it is protected in many regions and is often cultivated in controlled settings.</p>
