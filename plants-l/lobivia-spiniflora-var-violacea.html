<p>Lobivia spiniflora var. violacea, commonly known as the violet-flowered lobivia, is a succulent native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>

Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
