<p>Leptorkis glossula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in wetland areas and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
