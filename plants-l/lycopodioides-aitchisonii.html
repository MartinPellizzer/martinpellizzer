<p>Lycopodioides aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
