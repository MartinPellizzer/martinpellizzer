                    <h1>Lotodes humile</h1>
<p>Lotodes humile, commonly known as the small water lily, is a delicate aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant features floating leaves with a waxy surface and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, and it plays a role in water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich waters.</p>
