                    <h1>Larix dahurica var. kurilensis</h1>
<p>Larix dahurica var. kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the islands of the Russian Far East and parts of northern Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its wood is lightweight and is occasionally used for construction and furniture.</p>
