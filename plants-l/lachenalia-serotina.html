<p>Lachenalia serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering lachenalia, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Lachenalia serotina is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
