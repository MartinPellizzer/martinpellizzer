                    <h1>Loranthus uraguensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus uraguensis, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Andes, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected off the host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to its host.</p>
