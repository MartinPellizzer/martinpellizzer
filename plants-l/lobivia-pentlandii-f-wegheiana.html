<p>Lobivia pentlandii f. wegheiana, commonly known as the Wegheian Lobivia, is a rare and unique cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often branch into multiple offsets, forming a compact, globular shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by collectors and requires careful cultivation.</p>
