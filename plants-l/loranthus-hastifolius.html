                    <h1>Loranthus hastifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus hastifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host trees through a specialized structure called a haustorium.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows on various host species such as acacias and eucalyptus. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus hastifolius plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects, while also potentially affecting the growth of its host trees.</p>
