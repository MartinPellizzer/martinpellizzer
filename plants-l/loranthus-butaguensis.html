                    <h1>Loranthus butaguensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus butaguensis, commonly known as the Butao mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forest ecosystems.</p>
