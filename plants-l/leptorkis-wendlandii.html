<p>Leptorkis wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland's leptorkis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, which help in reducing water loss in its native arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
