<p>Leptinella filiformis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Leptinella filiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is an important part of the alpine flora.</p>
