<p>Lilium × elegans var. batemanniae, commonly known as the Batemann's lily, is a hybrid species within the genus Lilium, characterized by its striking, showy flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It typically produces large, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and red, with a distinctive recurved shape. The plant is perennial, with sword-shaped leaves that form a dense rosette, and it prefers well-drained, fertile soil.</p>
