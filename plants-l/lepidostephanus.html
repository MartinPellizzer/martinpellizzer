<p>Lepidostephanus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that emit a faint, golden glow under certain light conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, star-shaped formations along the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Lepidostephanus is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
