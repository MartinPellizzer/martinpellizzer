                    <h1>Leucostegia parvula</h1>
<p>Leucostegia parvula, commonly known as the small-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its succulent structure helps it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>Leucostegia parvula is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sun-exposed habitats.</p>
