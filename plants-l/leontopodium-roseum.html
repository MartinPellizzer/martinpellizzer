<p>Leontopodium roseum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow flowers, which are surrounded by a ring of bracts that resemble a crown. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on rocky slopes and meadows where the climate is cool and moist. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and purity in many cultures.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also considered a protected species in several countries.</p>
