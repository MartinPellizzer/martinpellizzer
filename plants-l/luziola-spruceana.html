<p>Luziola spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to the surfaces of trees, typically on coniferous bark. The thallus is pale to dark grey, often with a granular texture, and it contains a mix of photobionts, primarily green algae. It is found in temperate and boreal regions, growing on tree trunks and branches in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator species for forest health and air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
