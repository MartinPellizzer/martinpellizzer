                    <h1>Lupinus nepubescens</h1>
<p>Lupinus nepubescens, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spindly stems with clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Its root system forms nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Lupinus nepubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
