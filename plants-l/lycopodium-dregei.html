                    <h1>Lycopodium dregei</h1>
<p>Lycopodium dregei, commonly known as the Cape clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with upright, club-like stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are characteristic of its primitive evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>Lycopodium dregei plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant structures.</p>
