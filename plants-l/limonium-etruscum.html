                    <h1>Limonium etruscum</h1>
<p>Limonium etruscum, commonly known as the Etruscan sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Limonium etruscum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils.</p>
