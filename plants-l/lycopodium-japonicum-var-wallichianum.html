                    <h1>Lycopodium japonicum var. wallichianum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium japonicum var. wallichianum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the Himalayas and parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its branching stems, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to form dense ground covers.</p>
