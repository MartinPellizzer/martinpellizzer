                    <h1>Loranthus kaniensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus kaniensis, commonly known as the Kani hill mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while it also performs photosynthesis. It is often found in moist, shaded environments at higher altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
