                    <h1>Licuala paniculata</h1>
<p>Licuala paniculata, commonly known as the giant cycad or the Philippine cycad, is a striking evergreen plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces distinctive cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is also considered a conservation concern in its native habitat.</p>
