                    <h1>Leucaena plurijuga</h1>
<p>Leucaena plurijuga, commonly known as the silverleaf leucaena, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often silvery-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for forage, erosion control, and soil improvement.</p>
<p>Leucaena plurijuga is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enhances soil fertility.</p>
