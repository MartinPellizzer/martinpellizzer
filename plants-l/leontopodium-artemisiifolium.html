                    <h1>Leontopodium artemisiifolium</h1>
<p>Leontopodium artemisiifolium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white flowers surrounded by a ring of pale green bracts. The plant thrives in harsh, rocky environments with low temperatures and high UV exposure. Its leaves are narrow and silver-white, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and association with the Alps, it is a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions.</p>
