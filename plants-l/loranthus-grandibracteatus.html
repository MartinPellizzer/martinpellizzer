                    <h1>Loranthus grandibracteatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus grandibracteatus, commonly known as the large-bract mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale green. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense forest canopies.</p>
