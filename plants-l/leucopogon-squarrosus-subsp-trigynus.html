<p>Leucopogon squarrosus subsp.</p>
<p>trigynus, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas exposed to salt spray.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
