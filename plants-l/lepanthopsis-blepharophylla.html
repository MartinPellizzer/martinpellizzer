                    <h1>Lepanthopsis blepharophylla</h1>
<p>Lepanthopsis blepharophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and sepals, which give it its ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white and green.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and limited habitat, it is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
