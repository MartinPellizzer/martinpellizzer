                    <h1>Lycopodium clavatum var. eriostachys</h1>
<p>Lycopodium clavatum var. eriostachys, commonly known as the club moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more densely packed strobila compared to the typical form of Lycopodium clavatum.</p>
