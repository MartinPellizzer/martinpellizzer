<p>Lucaya choriophylla, commonly known as the red-leaved ironwood, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with striking red or purple leaves that change color with the seasons. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by oval, woody fruits. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Lucaya choriophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a hedge plant.</p>
