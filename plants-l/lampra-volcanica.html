                    <h1>Lampra volcanica</h1>
<p>Lampra volcanica, commonly known as the fire orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils found in volcanic ash and lava fields. Its unique coloration is an adaptation to attract specific pollinators in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
