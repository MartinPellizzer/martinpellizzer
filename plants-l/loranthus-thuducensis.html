<p>Loranthus thuducensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems and leaves. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
