                    <h1>Linaria bipunctata var. glutinosa</h1>
<p>Linaria bipunctata var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant produces small, sticky seeds that aid in its dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
