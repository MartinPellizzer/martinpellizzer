                    <h1>Lachnagrostis roylei</h1>
<p>Lachnagrostis roylei, commonly known as the Himalayan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in mountainous regions with limited soil coverage.</p>
<p>Lachnagrostis roylei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
