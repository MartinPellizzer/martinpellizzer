                    <h1>Lycopodium flabelliforme f. wibbei</h1>
<p>Lycopodium flabelliforme f. wibbei, commonly known as the Wibbe's clubmoss, is a rare fern ally characterized by its compact, evergreen habit.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that form dense, bushy clusters, typical of the Lycopodiaceae family. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages.</p>
