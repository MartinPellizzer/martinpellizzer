                    <h1>Lycopodium cancellatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium cancellatum, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered in dense, cone-like formations at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium cancellatum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
