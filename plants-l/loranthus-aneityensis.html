                    <h1>Loranthus aneityensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus aneityensis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It is an evergreen shrub that can grow up to 3 meters in height.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its parasitic nature and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
