                    <h1>Lindsaea × michleriana</h1>
<p>Lindsaea × michleriana, commonly known as the Michler's lace fern, is a hybrid epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, which is typical of epiphytic species. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This plant requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
