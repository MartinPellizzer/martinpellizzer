                    <h1>Loranthus pungu</h1>
<p>Loranthus pungu, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own nutrients through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it a significant ecological concern in certain regions.</p>
<p>Loranthus pungu is native to sub-Saharan Africa and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
