                    <h1>Leymus salina</h1>
<p>Leymus salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Leymus salina thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, making it an important component of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and habitat provision.</p>
