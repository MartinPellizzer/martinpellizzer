<p>Lepidium hirtum subsp.</p>
<p>petrophilum, commonly known as the rock pepper or mountain pepper, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.

<p>The plant typically grows in limestone or calcareous soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its fruits are small, dry pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
