                    <h1>Limnorchis limosa</h1>
<p>Limnorchis limosa, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>Limnorchis limosa is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
