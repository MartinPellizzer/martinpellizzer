<p>Lachemilla orizabensis, commonly known as the Mexican stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Lachemilla orizabensis is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
