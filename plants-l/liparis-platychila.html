<p>Liparis platychila, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and bog environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that bear several lance-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and somewhat succulent. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
