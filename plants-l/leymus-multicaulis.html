<p>Leymus multicaulis, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 3 to 5 centimeters long, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and moderate drought conditions.</p>
<p>Leymus multicaulis plays an important role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
