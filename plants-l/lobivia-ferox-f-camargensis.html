<p>Lobivia ferox f. camargensis, commonly known as the Camargue lobivia, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Spain and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract various pollinators. Its fleshy leaves and thick stems are adaptations to conserve water in its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
