<p>Lepisorus rostratus, commonly known as the rostrate rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and extensively branched, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>Lepisorus rostratus is notable for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
