<p>Leopoldia cycladica, commonly known as the Cycladic leopoldia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Cyclades islands in Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
