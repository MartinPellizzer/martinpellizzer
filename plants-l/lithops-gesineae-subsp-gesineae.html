<p>Lithops gesineae subsp.</p>
<p>gesineae, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "living stone," is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that resemble stones, helping it survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
