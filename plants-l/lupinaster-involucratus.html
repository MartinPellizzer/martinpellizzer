                    <h1>Lupinaster involucratus</h1>
<p>Lupinaster involucratus, commonly known as the woolly lupin, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and dense clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red. The plant produces distinctive, hairy, bract-like structures that surround its flower clusters, giving it a woolly appearance. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Lupinaster involucratus plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
