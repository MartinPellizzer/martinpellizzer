                    <h1>Leontonyx tomentosus</h1>
<p>Leontonyx tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a dense, woolly appearance due to its thick, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique structure make it an important indicator of environmental health.</p>
