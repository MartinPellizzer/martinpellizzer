                    <h1>Leptodactylon watsonii f. aridum</h1>
<p>Leptodactylon watsonii f. aridum, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, low-nutrient soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
