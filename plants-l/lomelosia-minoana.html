<p>Lomelosia minoana, commonly known as the Minoan lomelosia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Crete in Greece.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lomelosia minoana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
