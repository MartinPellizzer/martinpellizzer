<p>Lonchitis polypodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a delicate aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
