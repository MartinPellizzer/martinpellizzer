                    <h1>Lindmania geniculata var. minor</h1>
<p>Lindmania geniculata var. minor, commonly known as the miniature bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>

The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
