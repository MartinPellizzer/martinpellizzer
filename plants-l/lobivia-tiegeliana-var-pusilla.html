<p>Lobivia tiegeliana var. pusilla, commonly known as the miniature lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically greenish-gray in color, adorned with clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny areoles and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent.</p>
