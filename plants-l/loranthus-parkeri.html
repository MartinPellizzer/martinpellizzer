                    <h1>Loranthus parkeri</h1>
<p>Loranthus parkeri, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits by stimulating growth in the host. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds by animals, which then germinate on the bark of suitable host trees.</p>
<p>Loranthus parkeri is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
