<p>Lycopodioides geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodioides geniculata reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>It is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for small organisms.</p>
