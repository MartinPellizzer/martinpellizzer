                    <h1>Luffa tenera</h1>
<p>Luffa tenera, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and elongated, hollow fruits that mature into spongy, fibrous structures. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its fruit, often harvested when mature, is used for its spongy interior, which is ideal for scrubbing.</p>
<p>Luffa tenera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in many parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
