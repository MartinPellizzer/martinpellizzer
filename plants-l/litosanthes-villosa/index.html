                            <h1>Litosanthes Villosa</h1>
<p>Velvetleaf, scientifically known as Litosanthes villosa, is a tropical weed commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates. This plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. It is often regarded as a problematic invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Velvetleaf thrives in disturbed soils and is frequently seen in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Despite its reputation as a weed, it has cultural and ecological significance in some regions.</p>
