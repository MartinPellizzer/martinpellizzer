<p>Linum perenne var. procumbens, commonly known as creeping flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, delicate blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Creeping flax is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
