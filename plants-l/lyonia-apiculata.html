                <h1>Lyonia apiculata</h1>
<p>Lyonia apiculata, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist into the winter. Lyonia apiculata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
