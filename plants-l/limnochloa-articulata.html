<p>Limnochloa articulata, commonly known as the water bamboo or swamp bamboo, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with long, narrow leaves. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize sediments and prevent erosion. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Limnochloa articulata is valued for its ability to improve water quality by filtering pollutants and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
