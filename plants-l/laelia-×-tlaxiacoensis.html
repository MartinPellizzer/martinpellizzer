                    <h1>Laelia × tlaxiacoensis</h1>
<p>Laelia × tlaxiacoensis, commonly known as the Tlaxiaco hybrid, is a hybrid orchid resulting from crosses between Laelia and other species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting flowers that often display a mix of colors such as pink, white, and yellow. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its adaptation to its native arid and semi-arid environments. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for intermediate to advanced orchid growers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, Laelia × tlaxiacoensis is valued both for ornamental purposes and botanical study.</p>
