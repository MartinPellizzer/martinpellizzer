<p>Lepidaria vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits containing several seeds. Lepidaria vaginata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of moist to wet environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many areas.</p>
