                    <h1>Lathyrus montanus var. linifolius</h1>
<p>Lathyrus montanus var. linifolius, commonly known as the slender field bean, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pea-like flowers and compound leaves. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and slender stems, which help it thrive in open, sunny habitats. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of many legumes.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
