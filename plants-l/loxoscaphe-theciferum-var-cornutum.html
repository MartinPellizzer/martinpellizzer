                    <h1>Loxoscaphe theciferum var. cornutum</h1>
<p>Loxoscaphe theciferum var. cornutum, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates for nutrition. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially emergent.</p>
<p>The unique morphology and trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
