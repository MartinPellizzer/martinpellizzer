<p>Lycopodiella bradei, commonly known as the Brade's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to tropical regions of Africa and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant has simple, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces spore-bearing cones called strobili. Lycopodiella bradei is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying the evolution of early land plants.</p>
