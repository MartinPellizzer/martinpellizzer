<p>Lemna cherokensis, commonly known as the common duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the nodes along the stolons. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and ditches.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can form dense mats on the water surface, impacting water quality and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
