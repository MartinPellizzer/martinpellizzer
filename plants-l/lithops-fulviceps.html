<p>Lithops fulviceps, commonly known as the Cape Town ice plant, is a species of succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant's leaves are typically pale green with a white or pinkish hue, and they often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lithops fulviceps produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to mimic surrounding stones make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
