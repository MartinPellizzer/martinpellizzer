                    <h1>Lemnopsis minioides</h1>
<p>Lemnopsis minioides, commonly known as the miniature water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and rapid reproduction, it plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
