                    <h1>Loranthus ruspolii</h1>
<p>Loranthus ruspolii, commonly known as the Italian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant forms a dense, evergreen growth with small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fragrant flowers that bloom in winter. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity through its parasitic and mutualistic relationships.</p>
