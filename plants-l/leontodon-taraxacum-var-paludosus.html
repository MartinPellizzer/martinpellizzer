                    <h1>Leontodon taraxacum var. paludosus</h1>
<p>Leontodon taraxacum var. paludosus, commonly known as the bog dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a single flower head.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, acidic soils, typically found in bogs, marshes, and other moist environments. The plant has a taproot system that helps it anchor in waterlogged conditions, and its leaves are covered in fine hairs that aid in water retention. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family, and it produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed.</p>
<p>This variant is often distinguished from other dandelion species by its habitat preference and morphological adaptations to wetland environments.</p>
