                    <h1>Lythrum salicaria f. depauperatum</h1>
<p>Lythrum salicaria f. depauperatum, commonly known as the sparseflower sweetroot, is a rare and lesser-known form of the purple loosestrife.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its reduced floral structures compared to the typical species. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its small, pale pink to white flowers are clustered in spikes, and it has narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations across its native range.</p>
