<p>Luzula multiflora subsp.</p>
<p>incrassata, commonly known as the broad-leaved woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The plant features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are often broader than those of other Luzula species. Its inflorescence consists of clusters of small, spike-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
