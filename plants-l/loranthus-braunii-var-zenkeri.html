                    <h1>Loranthus braunii var. zenkeri</h1>
<p>Loranthus braunii var. zenkeri, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its berries are typically red or yellow, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal. It is native to tropical Africa and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
