                            <h1>Leucanthemum Atratum Subsp. Illyricum</h1>
<p>Illyrian leucanthemum, scientifically known as Leucanthemum atratum subsp. illyricum, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its striking white petals and dark centers. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique morphology and habitat preferences, often growing in rocky and alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this rare botanical gem from further decline.</p>
