                    <h1>Loranthus immersus</h1>
<p>Loranthus immersus, commonly known as the water mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus immersus is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on a variety of host species.</p>
