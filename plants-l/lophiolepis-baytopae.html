<p>Lophiolepis baytopae, commonly known as the Baytop's lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a smooth, leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungus, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is often found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
