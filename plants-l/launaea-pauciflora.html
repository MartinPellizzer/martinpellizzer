<p>Launaea pauciflora, commonly known as the spiny leaf cholla, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and cylindrical, spiny stems. The plant has succulent leaves that are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Launaea pauciflora is well adapted to desert conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to store water in its stems.</p>
