                            <h1>Lamium Vulgatum</h1>
<p>Lamium, scientifically known as Lamium vulgatum, is a versatile and hardy herbaceous plant commonly found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. It is recognized for its attractive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in woodland edges, gardens, and shady areas, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological purposes. Its ability to spread through runners and self-seeding makes it a resilient addition to natural and cultivated landscapes. With its low maintenance requirements and aesthetic appeal, Lamium vulgatum is a valuable plant for gardeners and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
