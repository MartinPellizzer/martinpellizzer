                    <h1>Loranthus cylindricus</h1>
<p>Loranthus cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to regions of Africa, including South Africa. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. Its small, oval-shaped leaves and red berries are characteristic features.</p>
<p>It plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for birds and insects.</p>
