<p>Lychnis apetala f. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in open, rocky habitats. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It is adapted to harsh conditions with a compact growth form and deep root system.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary response to extreme climates.</p>
