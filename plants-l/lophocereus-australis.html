<p>Lophocereus australis, commonly known as the Australian night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to access underground moisture.</p>
<p>Lophocereus australis is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
