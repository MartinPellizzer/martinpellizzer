                    <h1>Lepidium montanum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Lepidium montanum var. glabrum, commonly known as mountain peppergrass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) surfaces and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other Lepidium species by its lack of hairy surfaces and its specific habitat preferences.</p>
