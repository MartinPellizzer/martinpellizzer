                            <h1>Lupinus Parviflorus Subsp. Myrianthus</h1>
<p>Blue lupine, scientifically known as Lupinus parviflorus subsp. myrianthus, is a striking member of the legume family native to the western United States. This plant is characterized by its vibrant blue flowers and feathery foliage, making it a popular choice for native gardens and ecological restoration projects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. The blue lupine plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Its unique appearance and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
