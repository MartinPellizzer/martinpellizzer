                    <h1>Lolium rigidum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Lolium rigidum var. glabrum, commonly known as rigid ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically glabrous, or smooth, hence its varietal name. The plant produces spikelets that are usually arranged in clusters, with lemmas that are often hairy. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often used in forage and erosion control.</p>
