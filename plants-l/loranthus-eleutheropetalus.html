                    <h1>Loranthus eleutheropetalus</h1>
<p>Loranthus eleutheropetalus, commonly known as the sweet acacia or Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, green leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its fruits are dry capsules that release tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees to begin new growth.</p>
<p>This species is native to regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
