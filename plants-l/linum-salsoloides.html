                    <h1>Linum salsoloides</h1>
<p>Linum salsoloides, commonly known as saltbush flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It belongs to the genus Linum, which includes other species of flax, though it is not related to the economically important flax used for fiber.</p>
<p>Linum salsoloides plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
