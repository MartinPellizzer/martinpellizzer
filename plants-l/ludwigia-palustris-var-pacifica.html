<p>Ludwigia palustris var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific marsh Ludwigia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels near the base of the plant. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and tidal flats, and is adapted to brackish or saline conditions.</p>
