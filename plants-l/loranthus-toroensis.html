                    <h1>Loranthus toroensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus toroensis, commonly known as the Torosan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
