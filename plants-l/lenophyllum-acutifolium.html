<p>Lenophyllum acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, acute leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the leaves, typical of many fern species.</p>
