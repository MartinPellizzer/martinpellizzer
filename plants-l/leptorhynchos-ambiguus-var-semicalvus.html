<p>Leptorhynchos ambiguus var. semicalvus, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rough to the touch, and its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikelets. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairiness compared to the typical form of the species.</p>
