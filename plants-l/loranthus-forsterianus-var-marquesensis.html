                    <h1>Loranthus forsterianus var. marquesensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus forsterianus var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Pacific region.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
