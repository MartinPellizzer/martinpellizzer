                    <h1>Loranthus lonchiphyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus lonchiphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Africa, including parts of South Africa, and thrives in forest ecosystems. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
