                    <h1>Lycopodium × sabinifolium var. sitchense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium × sabinifolium var. sitchense, commonly known as the Siberian clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded, forested areas with acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
