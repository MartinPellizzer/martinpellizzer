                    <h1>Loranthus signatus var. angustatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus signatus var. angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
