                            <h1>Lilium Brownii Var. Alexandrae</h1>
<p>Lilium brownii var. alexandrae is a rare and elegant species of lily native to the mountainous regions of China. This beautiful flower is known for its striking white petals and vibrant orange-red stamen that contrast beautifully with its pale blooms. It is named after Alexandra, the daughter of the British Consul in China, who was instrumental in its discovery. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in rocky habitats at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
