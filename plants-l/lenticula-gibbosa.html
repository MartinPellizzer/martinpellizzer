                    <h1>Lenticula gibbosa</h1>
<p>Lenticula gibbosa, commonly known as the warty lichen, is a crustose lichen that forms a dense, uneven growth on tree bark and rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, warty or knob-like projections that give it a textured appearance. The thallus is typically pale to reddish brown and has a firm, leathery consistency. It is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on shaded, moist substrates.</p>
<p>This lichen is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and its role in ecological succession.</p>
