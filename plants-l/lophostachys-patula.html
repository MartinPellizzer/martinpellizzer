The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, helping it store water in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Lophostachys patula is also valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
