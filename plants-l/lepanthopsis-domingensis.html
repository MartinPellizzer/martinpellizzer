                    <h1>Lepanthopsis domingensis</h1>
<p>Lepanthopsis domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
