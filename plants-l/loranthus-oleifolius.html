                    <h1>Loranthus oleifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus oleifolius, commonly known as the oilleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Loranthus oleifolius is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
