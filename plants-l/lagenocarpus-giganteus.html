                    <h1>Lagenocarpus giganteus</h1>
<p>Lagenocarpus giganteus, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, which develop into fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in wetland or swampy environments, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
