<p>Lycopodium filicaule, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, club-shaped spore cones rather than flowers, which are typically found at the base of its foliage. Its leaves are narrow and scale-like, forming a mat-like structure on the forest floor.</p>
<p>Lycopodium filicaule is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in woodland areas.</p>
