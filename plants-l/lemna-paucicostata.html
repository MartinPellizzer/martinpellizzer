                    <h1>Lemna paucicostata</h1>
<p>Lemna paucicostata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. The plant has broad, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it float. It reproduces vegetatively through the production of tiny, green offspring called tubers, which can quickly colonize water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
