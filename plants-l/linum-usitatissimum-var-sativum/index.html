<p>Flax, scientifically known as Linum usitatissimum var. sativum, is a versatile plant with a long history of cultivation. It is native to the Mediterranean region and has been grown for thousands of years for its fibrous stems and nutrient-rich seeds. The plant is valued for both its industrial applications and its role in traditional medicine and food. Its fibers are used to make textiles, while its seeds produce oil and are a source of dietary fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. Today, flax continues to be an important crop in agriculture and a symbol of sustainability in modern farming practices.</p>
