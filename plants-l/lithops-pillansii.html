                    <h1>Lithops pillansii</h1>
<p>Lithops pillansii, commonly known as the "dune lithops," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pair of fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its thick, rounded leaves, which are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-orange flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring.</p>
<p>Lithops pillansii is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
