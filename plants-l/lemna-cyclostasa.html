                    <h1>Lemna cyclostasa</h1>
<p>Lemna cyclostasa, commonly known as the floating shield-leaf waternymph, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients directly through its leaf blades. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on water surfaces.</p>
<p>Lemna cyclostasa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes.</p>
