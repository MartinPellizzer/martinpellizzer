<p>Lasiocladus humbertii, commonly known as the desert broom.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
