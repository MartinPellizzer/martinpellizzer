<p>Leptodactylon pungens subsp.</p>
<p>hazeliae, commonly known as the hazel-leaved pungent fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, silver-white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich soil. Its fronds are usually a bright green color, with a soft, leathery texture that distinguishes it from other fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
