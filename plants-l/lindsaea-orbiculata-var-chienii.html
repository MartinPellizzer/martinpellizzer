<p>Lindsaea orbiculata var. chienii, commonly known as the Chinese basket fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its clustered, rosette-like fronds that form a dense, basket-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
