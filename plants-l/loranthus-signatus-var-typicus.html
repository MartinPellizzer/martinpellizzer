                    <h1>Loranthus signatus var. typicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus signatus var. typicus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is an important part of the local ecosystem.</p>
