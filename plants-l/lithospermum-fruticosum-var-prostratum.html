                    <h1>Lithospermum fruticosum var. prostratum</h1>
<p>Lithospermum fruticosum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate lithospermum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
