                    <h1>Linum usitatissimum var. indehiscens</h1>
<p>Linum usitatissimum var. indehiscens, commonly known as the indehiscent flax, is a botanical variant of the common flax plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique seed capsule that fails to open naturally, a trait that distinguishes it from the typical flax variety. This variety is primarily cultivated for its fibrous stalks, which are used in textile production. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
