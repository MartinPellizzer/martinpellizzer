                    <h1>Lingelsheimia capillipes</h1>
<p>Lingelsheimia capillipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus with a pale yellow to greenish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
