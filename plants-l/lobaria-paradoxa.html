<p>Lobaria paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed thallus with a leathery texture and a pale to dark green or yellowish color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with green algae and cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on tree bark, especially in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Lobaria paradoxa is often found in temperate regions and is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
