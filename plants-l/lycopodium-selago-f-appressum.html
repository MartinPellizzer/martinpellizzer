                    <h1>Lycopodium selago f. appressum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium selago f. appressum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing fern ally native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems. The plant produces sporangia in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically borne on the upper surfaces of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of understory vegetation in its habitat.</p>
