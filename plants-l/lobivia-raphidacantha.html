<p>Lobivia raphidacantha, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and pale green to blue-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its succulent nature allows it to store water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Lobivia raphidacantha is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant.</p>
