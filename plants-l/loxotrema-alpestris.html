<p>Loxotrema alpestris, commonly known as the alpine loxotrema, is a small, perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, often arranged in clusters at the leaf axils.</p>
<p>Loxotrema alpestris is valued for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens or alpine arrangements.</p>
