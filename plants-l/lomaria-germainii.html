                    <h1>Lomaria germainii</h1>
<p>Lomaria germainii, commonly known as the Germain's lomatia, is a rare and endangered shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
