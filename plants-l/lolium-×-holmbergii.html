                    <h1>Lolium × holmbergii</h1>
<p>Lolium × holmbergii, commonly known as hybrid ryegrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a combination of traits from both Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Lolium multiflorum (annual ryegrass).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage, which makes it highly desirable for forage and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and produces spikelets that are often clustered in groups of three. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly used in agricultural settings due to its high nutritional value and rapid establishment.</p>
<p>However, its aggressive growth can sometimes lead to competition with other grasses in mixed pastures.</p>
