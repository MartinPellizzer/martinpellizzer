                    <h1>Leucostele</h1>
<p>Leucostele, commonly known as the "white stem" plant, is a type of fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique vascular system, which lacks true roots and has a central cylinder of xylem. The plant typically has slender, upright fronds with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Leucostele thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant anatomy and evolution.</p>
