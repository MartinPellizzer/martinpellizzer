                    <h1>Lappula scleroptera</h1>
<p>Lappula scleroptera, commonly known as bladderleaf or bladderthistle, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structure, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Lappula scleroptera is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
