<p>Lindsaea rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosentstock's lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on the trunks of trees in rainforests. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Lindsaea rosenstockii is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens.</p>
