                    <h1>Lachnaea ruscifolia</h1>
<p>Lachnaea ruscifolia, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fungal hyphae and algae, giving it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, with the alga providing photosynthesis and the fungus offering structural support. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Lachnaea ruscifolia plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
