<p>Limonium serotinum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to maritime environments.</p>
<p>Limonium serotinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions.</p>
