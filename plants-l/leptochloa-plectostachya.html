<p>Leptochloa plectostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or wetland habitats, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are adapted for efficient reproduction in its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Leptochloa plectostachya is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
