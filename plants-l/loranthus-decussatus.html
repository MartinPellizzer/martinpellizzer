                    <h1>Loranthus decussatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus decussatus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to various host trees, primarily in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its green stems. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red or orange berries that are often consumed by birds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds via bird droppings, which then germinate on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>Loranthus decussatus is native to regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
