<p>Large-leaf rock fern, scientifically known as Lepisorus macrosphaerus f. maximus, is a unique and resilient plant species found in rocky and shaded environments. This fern is characterized by its large, broad leaves that give it a striking appearance in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often seen growing on limestone or granite surfaces. Despite its delicate look, the plant is highly adaptable and can withstand harsh conditions. Its presence in ecosystems contributes to biodiversity and serves as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed habitats.</p>
