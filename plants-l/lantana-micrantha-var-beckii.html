                    <h1>Lantana micrantha var. beckii</h1>
<p>Lantana micrantha var. beckii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>

<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many areas outside its native range.</p>
