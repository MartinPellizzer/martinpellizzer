                    <h1>Loxocarya magna</h1>
<p>Loxocarya magna, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a unique composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. The plant forms a dense, crust-like growth that can vary in color from green to yellowish depending on the season and environmental conditions. Its structure is highly specialized, with the algal cells embedded within the fungal matrix to maximize light absorption.</p>
<p>Loxocarya magna plays an important ecological role by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
