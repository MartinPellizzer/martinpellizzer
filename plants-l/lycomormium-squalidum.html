                    <h1>Lycomormium squalidum</h1>
<p>Lycomormium squalidum, commonly known as the stinking smut fungus, is a plant pathogen that primarily affects grasses.</p>
<p>It belongs to the fungal kingdom and is characterized by its ability to produce dark, powdery spores that can easily spread through the air. The fungus infects the reproductive structures of grasses, leading to the formation of galls that distort the plant's growth. It thrives in moist and temperate environments, often found in agricultural and natural grassland settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield and quality of grass crops.</p>
