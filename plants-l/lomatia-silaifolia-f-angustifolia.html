                    <h1>Lomatia silaifolia f. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Lomatia silaifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lomatia, is a rare and distinctive subshrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
