<p>Limnochloa media, commonly known as the water fern or marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome. The plant's leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that help it efficiently capture light in low-light conditions. Limnochloa media is often found in swampy regions and is adapted to waterlogged soils through its specialized root system.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
