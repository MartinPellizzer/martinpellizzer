<p>Limnorchis media, commonly known as the common water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, floating mats of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense cover on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and borne on long, slender stalks that rise above the water.</p>
<p>Limnorchis media plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
