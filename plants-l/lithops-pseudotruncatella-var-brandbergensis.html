                    <h1>Lithops pseudotruncatella var. brandbergensis</h1>
<p>Lithops pseudotruncatella var. brandbergensis, commonly known as the Brandberg rockhouse, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, which help it blend into its rocky habitat. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which reduces water loss and reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
