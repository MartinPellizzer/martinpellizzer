<p>Lathyrus pubescens var. monticola, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
