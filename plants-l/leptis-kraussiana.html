                    <h1>Leptis kraussiana</h1>
<p>Leptis kraussiana, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, papery, violet-blue bracts that resemble petals, though it does not produce true flowers. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it to retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in spring.</p>
<p>Leptis kraussiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal areas.</p>
