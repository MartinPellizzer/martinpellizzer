                    <h1>Lathyrus denudatus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus denudatus, commonly known as the naked-stem vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands.</p>
<p>Lathyrus denudatus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
