                    <h1>Lopholepis ornithocephala</h1>
<p>Lopholepis ornithocephala, commonly known as the bird's head fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble a bird's head, with a prominent central rib and lobed margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this feature may vary among different populations.</p>
