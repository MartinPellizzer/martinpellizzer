                    <h1>Loranthus fulvus</h1>
<p>Loranthus fulvus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is found in various parts of Africa and is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations.</p>
