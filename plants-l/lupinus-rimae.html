                    <h1>Lupinus rimae</h1>
<p>Lupinus rimae, commonly known as the Martian lupine, is a rare and unique plant species found in the rocky soils of Martian regolith.</p>
<p>It exhibits adaptations to extreme conditions, including high radiation and low atmospheric pressure, through specialized root structures and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of violet and white, which are believed to attract native Martian pollinators. Its genetic makeup suggests a close relationship to Earth's lupine species, indicating possible ancient evolutionary ties.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is considered a key indicator of potential habitability in extraterrestrial environments.</p>
