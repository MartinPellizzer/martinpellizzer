<p>Lepisorus superficialis, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, mat-forming foliage.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant features small, lanceolate leaves with a finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Lepisorus superficialis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ability to colonize difficult soils.</p>
