                    <h1>Lophophora diffusa var. koehresii</h1>
<p>Lophophora diffusa var. koehresii, commonly known as the Koehres' peyote, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico.</p>
<p>It produces a dense cluster of white, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, thick stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly mescaline, which has psychoactive properties.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional use in spiritual practices.</p>
