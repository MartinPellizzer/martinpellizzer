                    <h1>Lastrea cavitensis</h1>
<p>Lastrea cavitensis, commonly known as the cavernous lastrea, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Lastrea cavitensis is often found growing in rocky crevices, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
