                    <h1>Lobelia piliplena</h1>
<p>Lobelia piliplena, commonly known as the woolly lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves that give it its common name and help reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for native gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
