                <h1>Lithraea caustica</h1>
<p>Lithraea caustica, commonly known as the caustic lithraea, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its thick, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its extreme drought tolerance, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils where other plants struggle to survive.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to arid climates.</p>
