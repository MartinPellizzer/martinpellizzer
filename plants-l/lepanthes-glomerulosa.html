                    <h1>Lepanthes glomerulosa</h1>
<p>Lepanthes glomerulosa, commonly known as the clustered slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elliptical and slightly fleshy, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Lepanthes glomerulosa is often found growing in the understory of rainforests, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
