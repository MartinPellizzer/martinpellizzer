                    <h1>Laurus carolinensis var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Laurus carolinensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the Southern waxleaf laurel, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>The varietal form, pubescens, distinguishes it from the more commonly known Laurus carolinensis, which lacks the hairy leaf texture.</p>
