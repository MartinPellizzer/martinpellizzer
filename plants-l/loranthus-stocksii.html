                    <h1>Loranthus stocksii</h1>
<p>Loranthus stocksii, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees.</p>
<p>Loranthus stocksii plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
