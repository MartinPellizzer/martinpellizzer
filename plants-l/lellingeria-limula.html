                    <h1>Lellingeria limula</h1>
<p>Lellingeria limula, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. Lellingeria limula is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it a hardy species well-suited for xerophytic habitats.</p>
