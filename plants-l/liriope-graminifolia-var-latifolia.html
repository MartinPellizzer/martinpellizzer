<p>Liriope graminifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lilyturf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features grass-like foliage that is broader and more robust compared to other liriope species, with narrow, grass-like blades that can grow up to 12 inches tall. The plant produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender stalks. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense ground covers, making it suitable for erosion control and garden decoration.</p>
