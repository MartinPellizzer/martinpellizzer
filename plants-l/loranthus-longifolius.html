                    <h1>Loranthus longifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
