                    <h1>Listera fugongensis</h1>
<p>Listera fugongensis, commonly known as the Fugong moonwort, is a rare and endangered species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble those of other moonworts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or reddish in color, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
