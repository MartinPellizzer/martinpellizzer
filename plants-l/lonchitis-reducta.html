<p>Lonchitis reducta, commonly known as the narrowleaf waterplantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>Lonchitis reducta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
