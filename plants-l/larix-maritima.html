                    <h1>Larix maritima</h1>
<p>Larix maritima, commonly known as the coastal larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden yellow in autumn before falling, giving it a distinctive seasonal appearance. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime climates with cool temperatures and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
