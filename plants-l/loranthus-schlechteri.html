                    <h1>Loranthus schlechteri</h1>
<p>Loranthus schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates a healthy ecosystem, as it relies on specific host species for survival.</p>
