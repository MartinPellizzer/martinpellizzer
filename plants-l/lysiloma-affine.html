<p>Lysiloma affine, commonly known as the Mexican honey mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators, and its seeds are often dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Lysiloma affine is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with hot, dry climates.</p>
