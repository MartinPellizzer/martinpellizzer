                    <h1>Loranthus mannii f. wildemanii</h1>
<p>Loranthus mannii f. wildemanii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems despite its parasitic nature.</p>
