                    <h1>Lemna disperma</h1>
<p>Lemna disperma, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small, floating aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family.</p>
<p>It has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in diameter, and it reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation by producing small plantlets on its leaf surfaces. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth rate makes it a common indicator of nutrient-rich water conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, though they may vary in color depending on light and nutrient availability.</p>
