                    <h1>Lycopodium biformis</h1>
<p>Lycopodium biformis, commonly known as the club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and the presence of microphylls, which are simple leaves with a single vein. The plant produces spores in sporangia, which are clustered in strobila, or cone-like structures. Lycopodium biformis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures and ancient lineage provide valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
