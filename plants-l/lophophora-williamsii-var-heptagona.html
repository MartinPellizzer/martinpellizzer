<p>Lophophora williamsii var. heptagona, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a variant of the peyote cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spineless stems and a distinctive, rounded shape. The plant produces a unique fruit that contains a larval stage of the moth Acanthoscelides obtusiusculus, which is responsible for the "jumping" behavior. The fruit typically matures to a yellowish color and is often used in traditional practices.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Cactaceae family and is known for its alkaloid content, including mescaline.</p>
