                    <h1>Lappula microcarpa var. micrantha</h1>
<p>Lappula microcarpa var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf lappula, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
