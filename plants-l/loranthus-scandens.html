                    <h1>Loranthus scandens</h1>
<p>Loranthus scandens, commonly known as the mistletoe vine, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense thickets or along forest canopies.</p>
