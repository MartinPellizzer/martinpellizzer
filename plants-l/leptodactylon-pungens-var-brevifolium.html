                    <h1>Leptodactylon pungens var. brevifolium</h1>
<p>Leptodactylon pungens var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved staghorn fern, is a varietal form of the staghorn fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its distinctive, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome that anchors it to tree trunks or rocks, and its leaves are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical variety. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
