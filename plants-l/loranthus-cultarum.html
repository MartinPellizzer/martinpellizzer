                    <h1>Loranthus cultarum</h1>
<p>Loranthus cultarum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, bushy structure with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus cultarum plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
