<p>Lycopodioides suberecta, commonly known as the upright clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping or upright growth habit, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its stems. Lycopodioides suberecta thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ancient lineage provide insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
