                    <h1>Lycopodium × sabinifolium f. decipiens</h1>
<p>Lycopodium × sabinifolium f. decipiens, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and spore-bearing structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to certain regions of the southeastern United States. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with elongated, needle-like leaves that resemble those of the genus Sabina, hence its common name. Its sporophytes are typically small and clustered, with spores produced in specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and evolutionary botany.</p>
