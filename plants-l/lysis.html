                    <h1>Lysis</h1>
<p>Lysis, commonly known as the process of cell breakdown, is not a plant but a biological process.</p>
<p>It involves the disintegration of cellular structures, often due to enzymatic activity or physical stress. In botany, lysis can occur in plant cells during certain physiological or pathological conditions. This process is crucial for nutrient release and recycling in ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not a plant species and thus does not have botanical characteristics in the traditional sense.</p>
