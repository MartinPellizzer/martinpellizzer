                    <h1>Lithocarpus oleifolius</h1>
<p>Lithocarpus oleifolius, commonly known as the oil-leaf stone oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical and subtropical habitats. Its fruit is a hard, one-seeded nut enclosed in a spiny cupule, typical of the genus Lithocarpus.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its durable wood and is often found in lowland forests, where it plays a significant role in the ecosystem.</p>
