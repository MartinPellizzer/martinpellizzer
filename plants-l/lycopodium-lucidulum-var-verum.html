                    <h1>Lycopodium lucidulum var. verum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium lucidulum var. verum, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a relic of early plant evolution.</p>
