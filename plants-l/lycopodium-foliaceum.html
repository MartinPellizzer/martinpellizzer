                    <h1>Lycopodium foliaceum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium foliaceum, commonly known as the ground clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features tiny, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems, which are segmented and resemble club-shaped structures. Lycopodium foliaceum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, releasing them from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This ancient plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in forest ecosystems.</p>
