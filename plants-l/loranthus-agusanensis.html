                    <h1>Loranthus agusanensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus agusanensis, commonly known as the Agusan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the forests of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leafy foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients directly from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
