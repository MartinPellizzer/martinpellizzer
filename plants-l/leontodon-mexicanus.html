                    <h1>Leontodon mexicanus</h1>
<p>Leontodon mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican toothache plant, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its common name derives from the traditional use of its sap to relieve toothache pain, though it is not recommended for medicinal use without professional guidance.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
