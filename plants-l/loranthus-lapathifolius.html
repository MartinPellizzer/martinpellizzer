                    <h1>Loranthus lapathifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus lapathifolius, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Its parasitic nature makes it an important part of the ecosystem, supporting various bird species that consume its berries.</p>
<p>The plant's structure includes a stem with small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, woody structure that allows it to remain attached to its host for years.</p>
