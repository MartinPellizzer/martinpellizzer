                    <h1>Larix × eurokurilensis</h1>
<p>Larix × eurokurilensis, commonly known as the European larch, is a hybrid coniferous tree resulting from the cross between the European larch (Larix decidua) and the Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically bright green and turn gold in autumn before shedding, contributing to its seasonal aesthetic.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its visual appeal.</p>
