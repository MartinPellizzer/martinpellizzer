<p>Lathyrus hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, hairy pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Lathyrus hispidulus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators.</p>
