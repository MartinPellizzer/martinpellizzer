<p>Lomelosia graminifolia subsp.</p>
<p>arizagae, commonly known as Arizona feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and delicate, feathery seed heads that give it a soft, ornamental appearance.</p>
