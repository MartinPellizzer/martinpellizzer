                    <h1>Launaea bornmuelleri</h1>
<p>Launaea bornmuelleri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a short, erect stem with woolly, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in spring, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Launaea bornmuelleri is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
