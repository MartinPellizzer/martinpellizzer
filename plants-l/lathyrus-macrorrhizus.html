                    <h1>Lathyrus macrorrhizus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus macrorrhizus, commonly known as the large-rooted vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Lathyrus macrorrhizus is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia.</p>
