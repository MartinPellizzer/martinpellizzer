                    <h1>Loranthus grahamii</h1>
<p>Loranthus grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
