<p>Linum brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature.</p>
<p>Linum brevipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical connection to the flax plant, though it is not used for fiber production.</p>
