                    <h1>Lachnagrostis filiformis</h1>
<p>Lachnagrostis filiformis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has fine, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Lachnagrostis filiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
