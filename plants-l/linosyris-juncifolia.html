<p>Linosyris juncifolia, commonly known as the marsh flax, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Linosyris juncifolia is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it valuable for ecological restoration projects.</p>
