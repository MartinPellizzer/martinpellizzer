<p>Launaea calmadowensis, commonly known as the Calmadow thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant is typically shrub-like, with gray-green, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Launaea calmadowensis is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
