                    <h1>Lepanthes antioquiensis</h1>
<p>Lepanthes antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pale green or white. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild.</p>
