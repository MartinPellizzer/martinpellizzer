                    <h1>Loranthus subulatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus subulatus, commonly known as the needle-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along its stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by red berries that are a source of food for birds. Its parasitic nature means it derives water and nutrients from its host, often causing stress to the host tree.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic lifestyle, Loranthus subulatus plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting bird populations through its fruit.</p>
