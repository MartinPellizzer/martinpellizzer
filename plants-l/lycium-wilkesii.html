<p>Lycium wilkesii, commonly known as the Wilkesâ€™ boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces red berries that are edible and often used in traditional Aboriginal cuisine. Lycium wilkesii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient plant suited to harsh, semi-arid climates.</p>
