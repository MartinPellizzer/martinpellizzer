<p>Lathyrus niger subsp.</p>
<p>niger, commonly known as black vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep violet.</p>
<p>The plant produces elongated, bean-shaped pods containing several dark brown to black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility.</p>
