<p>Linnaea borealis subf.</p>
<p>nana, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically rounded or ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, fragrant white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or open heathlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is a characteristic component of the tundra and boreal ecosystems.</p>
