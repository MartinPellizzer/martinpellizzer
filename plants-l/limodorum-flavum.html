<p>Limodorum flavum, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
