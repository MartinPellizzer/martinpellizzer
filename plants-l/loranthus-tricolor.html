<p>Loranthus tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some nutrients in return. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus tricolor is native to parts of Asia and is often found on trees such as mango and eucalyptus.</p>
