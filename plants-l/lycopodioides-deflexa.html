<p>Lycopodioides deflexa, commonly known as the flexed clubmoss, is a species of lycopod that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its creeping growth habit and dense, needle-like leaves. The plant typically forms compact mats and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodioides deflexa reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This ancient lineage of plants plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
