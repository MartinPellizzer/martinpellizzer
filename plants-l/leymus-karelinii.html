                    <h1>Leymus karelinii</h1>
<p>Leymus karelinii, commonly known as the Karelin's oat, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Leymus karelinii is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it an important component of tundra and steppe ecosystems.</p>
