<p>Lycopodiella margueritae, commonly known as the marguerite clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves and small, clustered sporophylls. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are located on the upper surface of the sporophylls, a feature typical of many clubmosses.</p>
<p>Lycopodiella margueritae plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
