                    <h1>Lithocardium leucophlyctis</h1>
<p>Lithocardium leucophlyctis, commonly known as the white-leaved rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing additional protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>Lithocardium leucophlyctis is well adapted to rocky soils and requires minimal water, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens.</p>
