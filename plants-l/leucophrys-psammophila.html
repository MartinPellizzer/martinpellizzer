                    <h1>Leucophrys psammophila</h1>
<p>Leucophrys psammophila, commonly known as the sand dune lichen, is a unique organism that thrives in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, a symbiotic combination of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This species is particularly adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and high salinity conditions. Its structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate.</p>
<p>Leucophrys psammophila plays a crucial ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and contributing to soil formation in harsh environments.</p>
