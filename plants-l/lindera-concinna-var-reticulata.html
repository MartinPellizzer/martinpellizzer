                    <h1>Lindera concinna var. reticulata</h1>
<p>Lindera concinna var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated spicebush, is a variant of the spicebush species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its aromatic, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive reticulated or net-like pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year.</p>
