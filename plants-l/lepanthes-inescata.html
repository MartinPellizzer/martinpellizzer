                    <h1>Lepanthes inescata</h1>
<p>Lepanthes inescata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated by specific species of bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Lepanthes inescata is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
