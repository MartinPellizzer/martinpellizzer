                    <h1>Lycopodioides rionegrensis</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides rionegrensis, commonly known as the Rionegro clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodioides rionegrensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important species for botanical studies in tropical ecosystems.</p>
