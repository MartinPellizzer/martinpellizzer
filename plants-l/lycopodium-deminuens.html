<p>Lycopodium deminuens, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and tiny, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium deminuens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage traces back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living relic of early plant evolution.</p>
