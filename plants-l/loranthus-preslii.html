                    <h1>Loranthus preslii</h1>
<p>Loranthus preslii, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval leaves and white, waxy flowers that bloom in late winter. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations and maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
