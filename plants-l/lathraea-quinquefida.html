                    <h1>Lathraea quinquefida</h1>
<p>Lathraea quinquefida, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of other plants, such as orchids, to absorb nutrients and water. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with small, fleshy structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's roots. It is native to southern Africa and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, it plays a specialized ecological role in its habitat.</p>
