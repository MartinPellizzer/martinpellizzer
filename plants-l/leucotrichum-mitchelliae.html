                    <h1>Leucotrichum mitchelliae</h1>
<p>Leucotrichum mitchelliae, commonly known as Mitchell's lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. It is often found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
