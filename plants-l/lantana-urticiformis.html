                    <h1>Lantana urticiformis</h1>
<p>Lantana urticiformis, commonly known as the rough lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, orange, and red. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
