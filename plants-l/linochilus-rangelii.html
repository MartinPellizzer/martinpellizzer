                    <h1>Linochilus rangelii</h1>
<p>Linochilus rangelii, commonly known as the Rangel's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude grasslands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, showy floral structures that are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to harsh, cold environments, with thick leaves and a short, sturdy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linochilus rangelii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
