<p>Lacmellea pygmaea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed moss cushion, is a small, cushion-shaped moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical variety. The plant is often found in temperate regions, particularly in forest floors or on rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of undisturbed habitats.</p>
