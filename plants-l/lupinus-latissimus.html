                    <h1>Lupinus latissimus</h1>
<p>Lupinus latissimus, commonly known as the broadleaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, spikelike clusters of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus latissimus has deep taproots that help it thrive in poor, well-drained soils, making it a hardy species often found in open grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life.</p>
