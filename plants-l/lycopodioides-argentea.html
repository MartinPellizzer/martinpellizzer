<p>Lycopodioides argentea, commonly known as silver moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth and silvery-white appearance due to the presence of fine, reflective hairs on its leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its sporophytes are small and inconspicuous, with a single spore-producing structure called a sporangium.</p>
<p>Lycopodioides argentea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
