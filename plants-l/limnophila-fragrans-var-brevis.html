                    <h1>Limnophila fragrans var. brevis</h1>
<p>Limnophila fragrans var. brevis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features dark green, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often near the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful aquatic plant for water filtration and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
