                    <h1>Loranthus fuscus</h1>
<p>Loranthus fuscus, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and other hardwoods.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or green flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its seeds are dispersed by animals, contributing to its spread across various forested areas.</p>
<p>Loranthus fuscus plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
