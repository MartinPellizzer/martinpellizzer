                    <h1>Loranthus rufus</h1>
<p>Loranthus rufus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating its spread to new host trees.</p>
<p>Loranthus rufus plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to the biodiversity and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
