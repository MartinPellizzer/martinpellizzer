                    <h1>Lycopodium miniatum var. bolivianum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium miniatum var. bolivianum, commonly known as the miniature clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its tiny, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called sporophylls. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a feature common among primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>Its compact size and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
