                    <h1>Lagoa calcarata</h1>
<p>Lagoa calcarata, commonly known as the rock lagoon plant, is a unique succulent native to specific arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from the surface layer of soil.</p>
<p>Lagoa calcarata is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
