                    <h1>Lonchitis macrophylla</h1>
<p>Lonchitis macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Lonchitis macrophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
