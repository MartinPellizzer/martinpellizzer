                    <h1>Loranthus pyrifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus pyrifolius, commonly known as the apple dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily apples.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis in its green stems. The plant has a distinctive appearance with yellowish-green, thread-like stems and small, clustered flowers. It is often found in temperate regions and can be a common parasite on apple and hawthorn trees.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature makes it both a challenge for horticulturists and an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
