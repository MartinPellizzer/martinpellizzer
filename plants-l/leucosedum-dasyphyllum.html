<p>Leucosedum dasyphyllum, commonly known as the mossy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments.</p>
