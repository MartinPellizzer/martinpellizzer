<p>Lycopodioides ornithopodioides, commonly known as the feather moss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a primitive structure, with tiny, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait typical of ancient plant groups.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat.</p>
