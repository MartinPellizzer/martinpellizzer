<p>Legnephora, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Legnephora has no true roots, relying instead on its rhizome for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>
