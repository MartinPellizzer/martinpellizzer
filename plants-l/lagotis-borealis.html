                    <h1>Lagotis borealis</h1>
<p>Lagotis borealis, commonly known as the northern lagotis, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wet meadow habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold environments.</p>
<p>Lagotis borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various herbivorous insects and small mammals.</p>
