<p>Leucanthemum pseudocatananche, commonly known as the yellow archangel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
