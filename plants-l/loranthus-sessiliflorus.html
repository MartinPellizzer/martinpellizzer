<p>Loranthus sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*, through specialized structures called haustelia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus sessiliflorus plays an important ecological role by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
