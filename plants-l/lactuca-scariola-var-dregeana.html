                    <h1>Lactuca scariola var. dregeana</h1>
<p>Lactuca scariola var. dregeana, commonly known as the desert lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less common than other lettuce species.</p>
