                    <h1>Leptogastrodia major</h1>
<p>Leptogastrodia major, commonly known as the giant star orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the wet tropical forests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble stars, with vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive red and yellow throat. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. The plant's morphology includes long, strap-like leaves and a robust root system adapted to nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Leptogastrodia major is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
