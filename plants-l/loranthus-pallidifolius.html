                    <h1>Loranthus pallidifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus pallidifolius, commonly known as the pale-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain the seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host trees if not managed properly.</p>
