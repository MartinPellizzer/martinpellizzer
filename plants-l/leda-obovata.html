                    <h1>Leda obovata</h1>
<p>Leda obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a dense, crust-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish-green color. The plant's structure consists of a fungal component and algal symbionts that work together for nutrient absorption. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
