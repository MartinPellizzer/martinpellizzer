<p>Lycopodium durissimum, commonly known as the hardy clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, needle-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Lycopodium durissimum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
