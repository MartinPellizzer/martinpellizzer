                    <h1>Loranthus zeyheri var. minor</h1>
<p>Loranthus zeyheri var. minor, commonly known as the small mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can stick to the bark of host trees, facilitating further spread.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded environments within forests.</p>
