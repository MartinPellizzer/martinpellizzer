<p>Lycopodium magellanicum var. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, which is a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
