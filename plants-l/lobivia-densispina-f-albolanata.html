<p>Lobivia densispina f. albolanata, commonly known as the Albolanata Lobivia, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of southern Spain.</p>
<p>It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair, giving it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It is highly adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and relying on minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
