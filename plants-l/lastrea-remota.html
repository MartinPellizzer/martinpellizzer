<p>Lastrea remota, commonly known as the remote lastrea, is a rare succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to drought. The plant features a basal rosette of thick, cylindrical leaves that store water, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
