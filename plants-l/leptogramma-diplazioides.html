                    <h1>Leptogramma diplazioides</h1>
<p>Leptogramma diplazioides, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively, allowing it to colonize rocky or shaded areas.</p>
<p>Leptogramma diplazioides is often found in temperate regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
