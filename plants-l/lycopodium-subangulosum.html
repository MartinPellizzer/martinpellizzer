                    <h1>Lycopodium subangulosum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium subangulosum, commonly known as the narrow-angled clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of spirally arranged leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. L. subangulosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple, primitive structure reflects its ancient lineage within the lycophyte group.</p>
