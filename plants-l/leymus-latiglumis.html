                    <h1>Leymus latiglumis</h1>
<p>Leymus latiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native range.</p>
<p>Leymus latiglumis is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
