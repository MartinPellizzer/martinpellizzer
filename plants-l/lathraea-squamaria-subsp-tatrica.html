<p>Lathraea squamaria subsp.</p>
<p>tatrica, commonly known as the Tatran lichen orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that grows in alpine and subalpine regions. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its unique, leafless stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is typically found on rocky slopes and in mountainous areas with acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
