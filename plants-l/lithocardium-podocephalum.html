                    <h1>Lithocardium podocephalum</h1>
<p>Lithocardium podocephalum, commonly known as the rock heart fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lithocardium podocephalum is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
