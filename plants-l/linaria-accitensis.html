                    <h1>Linaria accitensis</h1>
<p>Linaria accitensis, commonly known as the Accitense toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and disturbed soils. Linaria accitensis thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it is primarily of interest for its ecological and botanical significance.</p>
