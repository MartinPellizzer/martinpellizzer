<p>Lessertia vesicaria, commonly known as the bladderleaf or bladderleaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
