                    <h1>Lobelia gruina var. rouaixii</h1>
<p>Lobelia gruina var. rouaixii, commonly known as the Rouaix's lobelia, is a rare and striking plant native to the humid forests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. This variant is particularly noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialty gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world.</p>
