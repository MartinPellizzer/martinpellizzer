                    <h1>Lastrea callipteris</h1>
<p>Lastrea callipteris, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of the soil.</p>
<p>Lastrea callipteris is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
