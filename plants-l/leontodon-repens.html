<p>Leontodon repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces slender, flowering stems that bear bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its flowers are typically tubular with five lobes, and the plant is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Leontodon repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
