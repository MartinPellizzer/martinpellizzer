<p>Leiandra, commonly known as the "flower of the sea," is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows along sandy shores and rocky outcrops, adapting to saline and wind-swept environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Leiandra is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
