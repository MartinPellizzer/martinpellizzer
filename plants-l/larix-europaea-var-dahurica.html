                    <h1>Larix europaea var. dahurica</h1>
<p>Larix europaea var. dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern Europe and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is lightweight and resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soils, contributing to its ecological significance in boreal and subarctic regions.</p>
