                    <h1>Loranthus praelongus</h1>
<p>Loranthus praelongus, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Rosaceae and Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense canopies where it can receive sufficient light for its limited photosynthetic activity.</p>
