                    <h1>Listera ovata f. multinervia</h1>
<p>Listera ovata f. multinervia, commonly known as the multifurrowed basket lily, is a rare and distinctive variant of the basket lily species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are often adorned with prominent, parallel veins, giving it its "multinervia" designation. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, resembling miniature baskets. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in specialized horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
