                            <h1>Larrea Balsamica</h1>
<p>Larrea balsamica is a hardy shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is known for its distinctive yellow-green foliage and its ability to thrive in extreme desert conditions. This plant is often referred to as the "goatweed" due to its historical use as forage for livestock. Its resinous leaves emit a strong, aromatic scent that can be both soothing and irritating. Larrea balsamica has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
