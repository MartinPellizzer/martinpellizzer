<p>Languas allughas, commonly known as the "cloud fern," is a rare and delicate plant found in high-altitude cloud forests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble woven fabric. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor itself to rocky substrates, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered an important indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
