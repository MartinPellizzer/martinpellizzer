                    <h1>Lycopodium × oellgaardii</h1>
<p>Lycopodium × oellgaardii, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a species resulting from the cross between Lycopodium clavatum and Lycopodium annotinum.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact mat. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Lycopodium × oellgaardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions.</p>
