<p>Limnophila hypericifolia, commonly known as water willow, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, with its roots submerged and stems reaching above the water surface. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged, while its flowering stems bear small, pinkish-white flowers. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>Limnophila hypericifolia is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
