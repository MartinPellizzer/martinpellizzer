                    <h1>Lobivia polycephala</h1>
<p>Lobivia polycephala, commonly known as the Crowned Nightshade, is a succulent native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its compact size and ability to store water in its leaves make it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Lobivia polycephala is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its resilience and unique appearance.</p>
