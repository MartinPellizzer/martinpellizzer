<p>Larrea potosina, commonly known as velvetleaf grevillea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a velvety appearance. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Larrea potosina is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
