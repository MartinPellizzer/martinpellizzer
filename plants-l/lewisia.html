                    <h1>Lewisia</h1>
<p>Lewisia, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their rosettes of fleshy, often blue or purple leaves that store water, adapting them to arid environments. They produce showy, single flowers in shades of pink, white, or yellow, typically blooming in spring. Lewisia species are generally low-growing and thrive in well-drained soils, making them popular in rock gardens.</p>
<p>Their unique appearance and drought tolerance make them valuable additions to native plant gardens.</p>
