<p>Lagoseris runcinata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Lagoseris runcinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions.</p>
