                    <h1>Leucorchis micradenia</h1>
<p>Leucorchis micradenia, commonly known as the small-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it forms a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination and growth.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
