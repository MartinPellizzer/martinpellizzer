<p>Lychnis palustris, commonly known as the marsh pink, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lychnis palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
