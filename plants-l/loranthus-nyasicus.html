                    <h1>Loranthus nyasicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus nyasicus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
