                    <h1>Lemna punctata</h1>
<p>Lemna punctata, commonly known as the spikerush duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length, with a distinct central vein. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-lobed, berry-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems, both as a food source and as a potential indicator of water quality.</p>
