                    <h1>Lycopodiella × copelandii</h1>
<p>Lycopodiella × copelandii, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Lycopodiella cernua and Lycopodiella tamariscina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Lycopodiella × copelandii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
