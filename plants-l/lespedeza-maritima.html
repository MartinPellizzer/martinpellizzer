                    <h1>Lespedeza maritima</h1>
<p>Lespedeza maritima, commonly known as sea lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Sea lespedeza plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
