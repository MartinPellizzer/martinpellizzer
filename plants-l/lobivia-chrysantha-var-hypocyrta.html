                    <h1>Lobivia chrysantha var. hypocyrta</h1>
<p>Lobivia chrysantha var. hypocyrta, commonly known as the yellow-topped lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
