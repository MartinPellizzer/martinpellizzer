                    <h1>Leptosyne arizonica</h1>
<p>Leptosyne arizonica, commonly known as Arizona hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Leptosyne arizonica plays a minor but ecologically significant role in supporting local insect populations and maintaining desert ecosystem balance.</p>
