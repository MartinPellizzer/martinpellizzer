<p>Lupinus ambaticus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Lupinus ambaticus plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants.</p>
<p>It is also a valuable species for ecological restoration projects in desert environments.</p>
