                    <h1>Lophochlaena oregona</h1>
<p>Lophochlaena oregona, commonly known as the Oregon lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its greenish-gray thallus with distinct, leaf-like lobes. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
