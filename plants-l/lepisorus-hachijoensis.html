<p>Lepisorus hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo Islands water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the Hachijo Islands in Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
