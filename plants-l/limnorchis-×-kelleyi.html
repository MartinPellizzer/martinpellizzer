                    <h1>Limnorchis × kelleyi</h1>
<p>Limnorchis × kelleyi, commonly known as the hybrid water shield, is a composite species resulting from the cross between Limnorchis americana and Limnorchis laevigata.</p>
<p>It is a floating aquatic plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland environments. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats with muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Limnorchis × kelleyi exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parentage and environmental conditions.</p>
