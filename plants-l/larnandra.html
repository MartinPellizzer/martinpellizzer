                    <h1>Larnandra</h1>
<p>Larnandra, commonly known as the silver grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and consists of several species, many of which are found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Larnandra species often produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>These plants are adapted to thrive in poor soils and are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
