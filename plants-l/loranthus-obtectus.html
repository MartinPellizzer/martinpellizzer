                    <h1>Loranthus obtectus</h1>
<p>Loranthus obtectus, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions and has cultural significance in various traditions.</p>
