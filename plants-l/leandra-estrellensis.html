<p>Leandra estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its growth is slow, and it is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Leandra estrellensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
