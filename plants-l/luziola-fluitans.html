<p>Luziola fluitans, commonly known as the floating willow, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features long, slender stems that float on the water's surface, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, appearing in clusters at the water's edge.</p>
<p>Luziola fluitans plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and small fish.</p>
