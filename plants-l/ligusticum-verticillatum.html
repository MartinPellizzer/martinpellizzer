                    <h1>Ligusticum verticillatum</h1>
<p>Ligusticum verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered devil's tongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a tall, upright stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system is fibrous and often branched, contributing to its hardiness in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Ligusticum verticillatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
