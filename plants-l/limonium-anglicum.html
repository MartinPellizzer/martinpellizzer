                    <h1>Limonium anglicum</h1>
<p>Limonium anglicum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed capsules that release seeds via wind dispersal. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Limonium anglicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions.</p>
