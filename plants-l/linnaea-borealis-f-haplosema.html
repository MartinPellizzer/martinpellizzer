                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. haplosema</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. haplosema, commonly known as the small-leaved twinflower, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Ericaceae, characterized by its preference for acidic, well-drained soils in shaded forest environments. The plant features small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. Its most distinctive feature is its twinflower clusters, which produce pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>This rare form is notable for its reduced leaf size and is often found in association with other boreal flora in cool, moist habitats.</p>
