                    <h1>Loranthus banahaensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus banahaensis, commonly known as the Banahae mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized relationship with host species, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems.</p>
