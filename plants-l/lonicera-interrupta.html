                    <h1>Lonicera interrupta</h1>
<p>Lonicera interrupta, commonly known as the redbank honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange-red, which bloom in the spring. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Lonicera interrupta is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
