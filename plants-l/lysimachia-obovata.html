<p>Lysimachia obovata, commonly known as the broadleaf water pepper, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in wetlands.</p>
<p>Lysimachia obovata is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat skin irritations and as a diuretic.</p>
