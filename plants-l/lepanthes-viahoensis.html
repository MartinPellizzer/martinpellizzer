<p>Lepanthes viahoensis, commonly known as the Viaho orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically feature intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes viahoensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
