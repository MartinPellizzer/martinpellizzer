                    <h1>Leontopodium japonicum f. happoense</h1>
<p>Leontopodium japonicum f. happoense, commonly known as the Japanese edelweiss, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a cluster of small, yellowish flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance reminiscent of the European edelweiss. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its foliage consists of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
