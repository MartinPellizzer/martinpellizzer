                    <h1>Leptaulus boivinianus</h1>
<p>Leptaulus boivinianus, commonly known as the Boivin's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a distinct coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure includes a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchid species, which plays a role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptaulus boivinianus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
