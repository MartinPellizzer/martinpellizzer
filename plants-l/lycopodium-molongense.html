                    <h1>Lycopodium molongense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium molongense, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium molongense thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
