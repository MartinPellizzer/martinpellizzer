                    <h1>Lolium multiflorum var. muticum</h1>
<p>Lolium multiflorum var. muticum, commonly known as annual ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It is often used in forage production and as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
