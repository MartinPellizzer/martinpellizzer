                    <h1>Libocedrus</h1>
<p>Libocedrus, commonly known as the incense cedar, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees native to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their aromatic foliage, which releases a pleasant, resinous scent when crushed. The leaves are typically scale-like and arranged in opposite pairs along the branches. Libocedrus species produce small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>
<p>They are often found in moist, temperate climates and are valued for their durable wood and ornamental appeal.</p>
