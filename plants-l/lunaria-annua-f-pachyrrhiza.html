                    <h1>Lunaria annua f. pachyrrhiza</h1>
<p>Lunaria annua f. pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-ribbed moonflower, is a variant of the common moonflower, characterized by its thickened, ribbed stems.</p>
<p>This frost-tender annual plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces striking, orb-shaped seed pods that turn from green to papery blue as they mature. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly the unique and decorative seed pods.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is similar to the typical Lunaria annua, but the thickened stems make it a distinctive variant.</p>
