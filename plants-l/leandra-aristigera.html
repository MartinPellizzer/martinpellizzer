<p>Leandra aristigera, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates make it a popular ornamental and shade tree.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
