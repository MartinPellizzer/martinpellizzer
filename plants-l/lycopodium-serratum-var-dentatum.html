                    <h1>Lycopodium serratum var. dentatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium serratum var. dentatum, commonly known as the serrated clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear spores, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Lycopodium serratum var. dentatum is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Its historical significance in paleobotany highlights its role in the evolution of early land plants.</p>
