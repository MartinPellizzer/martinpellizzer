<p>Lotus minor, commonly known as the lesser water-lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with the leaves and stems submerged beneath the water. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water, typically in summer. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes.</p>
<p>Lotus minor plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
