                    <h1>Loranthus philippensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus philippensis, commonly known as the Philippine mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and lacks true roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, including the Philippines, where it thrives in humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes problematic.</p>
