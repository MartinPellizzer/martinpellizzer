                    <h1>Leymus sibiricus</h1>
<p>Leymus sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as steppes, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Leymus sibiricus is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
