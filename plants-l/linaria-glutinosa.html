<p>Linaria glutinosa, commonly known as sticky toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a sticky surface that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Linaria glutinosa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
