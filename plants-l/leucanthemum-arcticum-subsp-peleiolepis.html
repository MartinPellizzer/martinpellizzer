<p>Leucanthemum arcticum subsp.</p>
<p>peleiolepis, commonly known as Arctic ragwort, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers with white ray florets, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary strategies for survival in extreme polar and high-altitude habitats.</p>
