                    <h1>Leptocarpus vimineus</h1>
<p>Leptocarpus vimineus, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along tidal zones. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize coastal sediments.</p>
<p>Leptocarpus vimineus plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and preventing erosion.</p>
