<p>Leptocyamus clandestinus var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved cryptic lichen, is a rare and elusive species belonging to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, foliose thallus with a dark, almost blackish upper surface and a lighter, more granular lower surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on bark or soil in temperate forest regions. It has a slow growth rate and is often difficult to detect due to its inconspicuous appearance.</p>
<p>This varietal form is distinguished by its smaller, more densely packed leaves compared to other varieties within the species.</p>
