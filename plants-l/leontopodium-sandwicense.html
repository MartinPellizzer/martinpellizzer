                    <h1>Leontopodium sandwicense</h1>
<p>Leontopodium sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically on rocky slopes and cliffs where conditions are harsh and competition is minimal. Its unique morphology is an adaptation to the extreme climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
