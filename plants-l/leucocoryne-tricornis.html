<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It is typically grown as a bulbous plant, with a short stem and clustered flowers that resemble a crown, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
