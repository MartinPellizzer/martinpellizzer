<p>Linaria supina var. lineata, commonly known as the creeping toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are linear and often slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
