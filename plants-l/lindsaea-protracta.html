<p>Lindsaea protracta, commonly known as the long-stalked maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Lindsaea protracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens.</p>
