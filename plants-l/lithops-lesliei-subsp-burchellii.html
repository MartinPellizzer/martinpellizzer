<p>Lithops lesliei subsp.</p>
<p>burchellii, commonly known as the "Pebble Plant," is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with two fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and collections of succulents.</p>
