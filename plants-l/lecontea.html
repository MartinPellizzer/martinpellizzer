                    <h1>Lecontea</h1>
<p>Lecontea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of only two species, Lecontea alba and Lecontea micrantha, both native to the southeastern United States. These plants are characterized by their delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. They are often found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, typically growing as low shrubs.</p>
<p>The genus is named in honor of the botanist John Le Conte, who made significant contributions to the study of North American flora.</p>
