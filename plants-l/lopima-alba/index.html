                            <h1>Lopima Alba</h1>
<p>White lopima, scientifically known as Lopima alba, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. This species is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that shimmer under sunlight, giving it its name. Despite its beauty, the white lopima is highly sought after by botanists and collectors due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern. Protecting this fragile species is essential for preserving the biodiversity of its native environment.</p>
