                    <h1>Leptochilus lanceolatus var. simplex</h1>
<p>Leptochilus lanceolatus var. simplex, commonly known as the slender-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient environments.</p>
