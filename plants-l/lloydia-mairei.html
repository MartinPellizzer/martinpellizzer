                    <h1>Lloydia mairei</h1>
<p>Lloydia mairei, commonly known as the Maire's lloydia, is a rare and striking member of the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The flowers are typically small, clustered in inflorescences, and display a range of colors from white to pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lloydia mairei is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
