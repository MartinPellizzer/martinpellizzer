<p>Lepisorus clathratus f. waltonii, commonly known as the Walton's rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid and temperate climates. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silky layer of trichomes, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
