<p>Lemmaphyllum microphyllum var. lutchuense, commonly known as the Lutchuense dwarf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests or on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
