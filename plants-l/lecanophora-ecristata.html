<p>Lecanophora ecristata, commonly known as the hairy ant plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique textured appearance. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the leaf axils, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens in warm climates.</p>
