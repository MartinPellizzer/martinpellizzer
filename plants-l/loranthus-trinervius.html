                    <h1>Loranthus trinervius</h1>
<p>Loranthus trinervius, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as mango and neem.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that contain sticky seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategy make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
