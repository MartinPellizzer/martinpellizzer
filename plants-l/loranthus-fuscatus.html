                    <h1>Loranthus fuscatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus fuscatus, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It produces small, red or yellowish berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems.</p>
