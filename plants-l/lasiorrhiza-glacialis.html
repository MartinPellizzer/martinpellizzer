<p>Lasiorrhiza glacialis, commonly known as the glacier lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized alpine species.</p>
