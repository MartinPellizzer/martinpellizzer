                    <h1>Leucothoe</h1>
<p>Leucothoe, commonly known as waxleaf leucothoe, is a genus of evergreen shrubs native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their glossy, elliptical leaves that often have a waxy appearance, which gives them their common name. Leucothoe species typically produce clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. They thrive in partial to full shade and are often used in woodland gardens for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as *Leucothoe axillaris* and *Leucothoe fontinalis*, which are prized for their hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
