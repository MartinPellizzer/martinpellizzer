                    <h1>Lithops comptonii var. weberi</h1>
<p>Lithops comptonii var. weberi, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "living stone," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its unique morphology helps it blend in with its surroundings, providing camouflage from herbivores.</p>
<p>Lithops comptonii var. weberi is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal watering and well-draining soil.</p>
