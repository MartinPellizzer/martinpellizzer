<p>Lachnaea striata, commonly known as the striped lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lichenes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct, striated thallus that appears in shades of yellow to orange. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various environments. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
