                    <h1>Lichtensteinia lacera</h1>
<p>Lichtensteinia lacera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, crust-like thallus that grows on rocks and soil in arid environments. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of green alga, which provides nutrients through photosynthesis. Lichenized fungi contribute to the structural integrity and protection of the algal partner.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in regions with low rainfall and is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
