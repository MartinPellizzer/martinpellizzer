                    <h1>Limeum dinteri</h1>
<p>Limeum dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's lime tree, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate beauty to its otherwise rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh desert environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Limeum dinteri is considered an endangered species.</p>
