<p>Lastrea lacera, commonly known as the hairy lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, branching stems covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many succulents.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
