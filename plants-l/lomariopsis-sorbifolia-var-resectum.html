                    <h1>Lomariopsis sorbifolia var. resectum</h1>
<p>Lomariopsis sorbifolia var. resectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomariopsis, is a rare and specialized fern native to specific regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, narrow leaves that form a dense, compact rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in coastal or subalpine environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and may exhibit a slight bluish tinge, and it produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
