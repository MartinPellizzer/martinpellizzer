                    <h1>Loranthus buvumae</h1>
<p>Loranthus buvumae, commonly known as the Buvuma mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native African trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and relies on its host for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its unique ecological role contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
