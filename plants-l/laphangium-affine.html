                    <h1>Laphangium affine</h1>
<p>Laphangium affine, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungus, enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found growing on tree bark or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator of air quality.</p>
