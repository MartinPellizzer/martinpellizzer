<p>Leontodon hastilis subsp.</p>
<p>alpinus, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is part of the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes.</p>
