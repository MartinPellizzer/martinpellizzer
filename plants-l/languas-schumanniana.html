                    <h1>Languas schumanniana</h1>
<p>Languas schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's lanugo, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Languas schumanniana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
