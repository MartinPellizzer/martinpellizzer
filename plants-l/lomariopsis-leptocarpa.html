<p>Lomariopsis leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Lomariopsis leptocarpa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
