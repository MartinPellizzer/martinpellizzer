                <h1>Lastrea albopunctata</h1>
<p>Lastrea albopunctata, commonly known as the white-spotted pincushion cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with dense clusters of spines that give it a pincushion appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
