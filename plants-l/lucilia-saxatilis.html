<p>Lucilia saxatilis, commonly known as the stone flies, is a genus of aquatic insects belonging to the family Limnophoridae.</p>
<p>These insects are typically found in fast-flowing streams and rivers, where they lay their eggs on submerged stones. The larvae, known as naiads, are aquatic and feed on algae and detritus, playing a vital role in aquatic ecosystems. They are often used as indicator species for water quality due to their sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>The adults have delicate wings and are short-lived, typically emerging during the summer months.</p>
