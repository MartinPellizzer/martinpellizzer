<p>Lilium bulbiferum subsp.</p>
<p>jankae, commonly known as the Janka's bulbous lily, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, typically in shades of red, pink, and white. Its bulbous rhizomes are an essential part of its growth cycle, allowing it to survive in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
