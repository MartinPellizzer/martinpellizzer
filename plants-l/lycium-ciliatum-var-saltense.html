<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green berries and silver-gray foliage, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and salt marsh habitats.</p>
<p>Lycium ciliatum var. saltense is adapted to extreme temperatures and is resilient to drought conditions.</p>
