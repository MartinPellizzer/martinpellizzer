                    <h1>Leucheria ibarii var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Leucheria ibarii var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth leucheria, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name "glabrata.". The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
