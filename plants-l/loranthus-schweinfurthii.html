                    <h1>Loranthus schweinfurthii</h1>
<p>Loranthus schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
