<p>Linum alatum, commonly known as the winged flax, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves with prominent, wing-like structures along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Linum alatum is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stems and leaves have been historically used for fiber production, similar to other flax species.</p>
