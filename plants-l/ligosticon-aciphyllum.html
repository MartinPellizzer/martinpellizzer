<p>Ligosticon aciphyllum, commonly known as the spiny leaf grass, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, adapted for wind pollination. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Ligosticon aciphyllum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
