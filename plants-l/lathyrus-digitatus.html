                    <h1>Lathyrus digitatus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus digitatus, commonly known as the finger vetch, is a climbing legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive lobed appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several elliptical seeds.</p>
<p>Lathyrus digitatus is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia.</p>
