                <h1>Lepiderema sericolignis</h1>
<p>Lepiderema sericolignis, commonly known as the forest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of dense forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
