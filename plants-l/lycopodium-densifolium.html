                    <h1>Lycopodium densifolium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium densifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage, which consists of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Lycopodium densifolium reproduces via spores rather than seeds, releasing them from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Its presence in an ecosystem often indicates a stable, undisturbed habitat, making it an important indicator species for certain forest types.</p>
