<p>Lycopodium linifolium var. flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, creeping rhizomes that produce clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically borne on short, erect stalks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its flexible, arching stems that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance.</p>
