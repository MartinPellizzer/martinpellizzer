                <h1>Lygisma inflexum</h1>
<p>Lygisma inflexum, commonly known as the bent-leaved lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a distinctive greenish-gray coloration. The plant consists of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is often found on rocks, soil, or tree bark in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
