<p>Lobivia schreiteri, commonly known as the Schreiter's lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white or pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
