                    <h1>Lycopodium everettii</h1>
<p>Lycopodium everettii, commonly known as the Everett's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of needle-like leaves and distinctive cone-like structures called strobili. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures produce spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of its ancient lineage.</p>
<p>Lycopodium everettii plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
