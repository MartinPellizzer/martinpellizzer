                    <h1>Limeum arenicola</h1>
<p>Limeum arenicola, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, and it lacks distinct lobes or rhizines. It is a photobiont-based lichen, meaning it forms a symbiotic relationship with green algae.</p>
<p>Limeum arenicola plays a role in soil stabilization and is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions in its habitat.</p>
