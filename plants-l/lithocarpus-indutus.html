<p>Lithocarpus indutus, commonly known as the glossy ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree belonging to the Fagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically glossy on the upper surface and pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, woody nuts enclosed in a cupule, which is a unique feature of the genus Lithocarpus. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in lowland to montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its dense wood and slow growth, it is valued for timber and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
