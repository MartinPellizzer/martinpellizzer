                    <h1>Lycopodioides remotifolia var. japonica</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides remotifolia var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically found at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
