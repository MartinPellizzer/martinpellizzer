<p>Lepidocupania mouana, commonly known as the Pacific island lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid tropical environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like thallus that is typically green or yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the majority of its nutrition through photosynthesis. It is often found growing on tree trunks and rocks in coastal and rainforest regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats.</p>
