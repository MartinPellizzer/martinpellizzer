<p>Lepisorus sinuatus, commonly known as the sinuous wall fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive sinuous pattern along the edges. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth, thriving in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>
