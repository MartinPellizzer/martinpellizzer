<p>Lichtensteinia trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, branched thallus structure and a distinctive, often brightly colored cortex. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. It is typically found on rocks, soil, or bark in temperate and arctic regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, Lichtensteinia trifida is an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
