                    <h1>Leighia hookeriana</h1>
<p>Leighia hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is often found growing in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leighia hookeriana is considered a conservation concern.</p>
