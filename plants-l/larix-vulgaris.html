<p>Larix vulgaris, commonly known as the tamarack, is a deciduous conifer native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that turn golden in the fall before shedding. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The tamarack is often found in wetland areas and is valued for its timber and ecological importance.</p>
