<p>Logania saxatilis, commonly known as the rock logania, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are usually red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Logania saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil.</p>
