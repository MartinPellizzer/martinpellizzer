<p>Loranthus rosiflorus, commonly known as the rose-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to parts of Africa, including South Africa. The plant has small, alternate leaves and produces white or pink flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of host trees for germination.</p>
<p>Loranthus rosiflorus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects while also relying on host trees for nutrients.</p>
