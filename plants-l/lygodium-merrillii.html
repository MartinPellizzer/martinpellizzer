                    <h1>Lygodium merrillii</h1>
<p>Lygodium merrillii, commonly known as the Chinese climbing fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, creeping rhizomes and compound leaves that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
