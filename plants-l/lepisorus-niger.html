<p>Lepisorus niger, commonly known as the black lepisorus, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus niger is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecology.</p>
