                    <h1>Lobanilia claoxyloides</h1>
<p>Lobanilia claoxyloides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by small, round fruits containing winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
