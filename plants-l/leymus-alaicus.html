                    <h1>Leymus alaicus</h1>
<p>Leymus alaicus, commonly known as the steppe grass or Alaskan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to withstand drought and grazing, making it an important component of grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion and contributes to soil stabilization in its native range.</p>
