<p>Lesquerella kingii subsp.</p>
<p>bernardina, commonly known as the Bernardina lesquerella, is a rare and specialized member of the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and covered in fine, glandular hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
