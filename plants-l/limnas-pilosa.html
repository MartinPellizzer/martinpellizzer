                    <h1>Limnas pilosa</h1>
<p>Limnas pilosa, commonly known as the silky water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has broad, floating leaves covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss and provide a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in the early morning. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Limnas pilosa plays an important role in water ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality.</p>
