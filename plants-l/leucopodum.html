<p>Leucopodum, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments. The flowers typically have a unique structure with long, slender petals that resemble ghostly shapes, contributing to their ethereal appearance.</p>
<p>Due to their rare and mysterious nature, Leucopodum species are of particular interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
