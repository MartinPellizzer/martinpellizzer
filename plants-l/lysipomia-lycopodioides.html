<p>Lysipomia lycopodioides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, stoloniferous growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lysipomia lycopodioides thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
