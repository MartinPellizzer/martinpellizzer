                    <h1>Linaria cymbalaria var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Linaria cymbalaria var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically alternate and vary in shape, which gives the plant its varietal name "heterophylla," meaning "different leaves.". It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, making it both a weed and a potential ornamental in some regions.</p>
