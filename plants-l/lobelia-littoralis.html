<p>Lobelia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern coast of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and tidal marshes, often in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet.</p>
<p>Lobelia littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local wildlife.</p>
