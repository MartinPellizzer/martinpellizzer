                    <h1>Larix laricina var. alaskensis</h1>
<p>Larix laricina var. alaskensis, commonly known as the Alaska larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the boreal forests of Alaska and northern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive golden-yellow foliage that turns bright yellow in the fall before shedding. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are flat, soft, and arranged spirally along the shoots, and they turn yellow and fall off annually.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in wetland areas, where it plays a vital role in local ecosystems.</p>
