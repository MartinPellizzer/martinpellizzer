<p>Loranthus regularis var. pilosus, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host through haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host tree.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Asia, particularly China, where it typically grows on the branches of various woody plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, silky white or grayish pubescence covering its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an ecological role in its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the forest canopy.</p>
