                    <h1>Larrea simulans</h1>
<p>Larrea simulans, commonly known as screwwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Larrea simulans is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples.</p>
