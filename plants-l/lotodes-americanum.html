<p>Lotodes americanum, commonly known as the American water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the United States.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water or mud. Its leaves are often covered in small, raised dots called bullae, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
