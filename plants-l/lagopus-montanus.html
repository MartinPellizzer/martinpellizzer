                    <h1>Lagopus montanus</h1>
<p>Lagopus montanus, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Arctic and subarctic.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer, typically in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are usually scale-like and tightly packed, reducing water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Lagopus montanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic wildlife species.</p>
