                    <h1>Lepanthes subalpina</h1>
<p>Lepanthes subalpina, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a species of orchid native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant grows in rocky or forested habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, nutrient-poor soils of its environment.</p>
<p>Lepanthes subalpina is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
