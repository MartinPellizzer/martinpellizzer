<p>Lophiolepis sivasica, commonly known as the Sivasica lichen, is a unique foliose lichen belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive thallus structure, which consists of a loosely branched, foliose body with a gelatinous cortex. The species is notable for its bright yellow to orange pigmentation, which is due to the presence of specific secondary metabolites. It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in environments with low humidity and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Lophiolepis sivasica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
