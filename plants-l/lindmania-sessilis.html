<p>Lindmania sessilis, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while supporting its floating fronds.</p>
<p>Lindmania sessilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
