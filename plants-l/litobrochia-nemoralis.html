<p>Litobrochia nemoralis, commonly known as the common rock-rose, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, open habitats such as coastal cliffs or woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Litobrochia nemoralis is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in regions with mild, Mediterranean climates.</p>
