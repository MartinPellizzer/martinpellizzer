<p>Lycopodioides unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Lycopodiophyta division.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinct, club-shaped sporophyte. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lycopodioides unilateralis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
