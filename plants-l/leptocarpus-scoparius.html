                    <h1>Leptocarpus scoparius</h1>
<p>Leptocarpus scoparius, commonly known as the coastal rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in sandy soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of its fertile leaves. It thrives in saline and humid environments, demonstrating a high degree of salt tolerance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations to coastal conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
