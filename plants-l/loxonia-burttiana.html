<p>Loxonia burttiana, commonly known as the Burtt's lichen, is a unique species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichen, typically found on shaded, moist rock surfaces in temperate regions. The thallus is foliose, with a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure that is often covered in a fine, powdery layer. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish coloration and the presence of isidiate structures.</p>
<p>Loxonia burttiana is of interest to lichenologists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
