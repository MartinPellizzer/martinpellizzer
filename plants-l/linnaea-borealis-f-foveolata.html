                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. foveolata</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. foveolata, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, moist habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly depressed or sunken flower buds, a trait that sets it apart from the typical form of Linnaea borealis.</p>
