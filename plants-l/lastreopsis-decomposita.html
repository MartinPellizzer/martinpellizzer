                    <h1>Lastreopsis decomposita</h1>
<p>Lastreopsis decomposita, commonly known as the decomposing lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a thin, crust-like layer on rocks and soil, often in temperate and subpolar regions. The plant's thallus is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its broad, flat structure for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental health and is often used in ecological studies.</p>
