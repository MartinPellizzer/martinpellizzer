                    <h1>Loranthus curviflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus curviflorus, commonly known as the curvedflower mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus curviflorus plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
