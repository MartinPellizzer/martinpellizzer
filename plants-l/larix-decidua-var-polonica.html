                    <h1>Larix decidua var. polonica</h1>
<p>Larix decidua var. polonica, commonly known as the Polish larch, is a variant of the European larch native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves in the autumn, distinguishing it from most other larch species. The tree typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters and has a conical or irregular shape. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its cones are small and woody.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its unique foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
