<p>Launaea tenuiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved launaea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, with narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in yellow or pale green hues, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes.</p>
<p>Launaea tenuiloba is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand prolonged drought conditions.</p>
