                    <h1>Leucothoe nummularia</h1>
<p>Leucothoe nummularia, commonly known as silver leaf leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered in a silvery-white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year.</p>
