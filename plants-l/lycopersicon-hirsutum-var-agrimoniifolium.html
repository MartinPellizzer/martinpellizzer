<p>Lycopersicon hirsutum var. agrimoniifolium, commonly known as the wild tomato or agrimony-leaved tomato, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It features hairy stems and lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Its botanical characteristics make it a close relative to the domesticated tomato, Solanum lycopersicum.</p>
<p>It is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications.</p>
