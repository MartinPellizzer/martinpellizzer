                    <h1>Launaea cornuta</h1>
<p>Launaea cornuta, commonly known as the horned dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is distinguished by its spiny, horn-like structures on its stems and leaves, which provide mechanical defense against herbivores. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces a distinctive, pappus-equipped seed that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Launaea cornuta is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting succulent leaves and deep root systems to conserve water.</p>
