                            <h1>Liatris Squarrosa</h1>
<p>Liatris squarrosa, commonly known as the rough blazingstar, is a striking native wildflower that thrives in prairies and open woodlands across the central and eastern United States. Its tall, spiky flower heads stand tall in late summer, creating a dramatic visual display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to flourish in poor soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its unique appearance and ecological benefits have made it a symbol of native biodiversity in many regions. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively unknown compared to other wildflowers, highlighting the need for greater awareness and conservation efforts.</p>
