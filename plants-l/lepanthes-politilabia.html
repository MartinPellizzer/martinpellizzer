                    <h1>Lepanthes politilabia</h1>
<p>Lepanthes politilabia, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature white petals with green veins. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role within tropical ecosystems and its value in horticultural collections.</p>
