                    <h1>Loranthus polystachyus</h1>
<p>Loranthus polystachyus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as mango and neem.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in India and Southeast Asia.</p>
