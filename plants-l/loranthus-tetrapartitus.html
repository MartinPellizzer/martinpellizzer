                    <h1>Loranthus tetrapartitus</h1>
<p>Loranthus tetrapartitus, commonly known as the four-parted mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are often clustered and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
