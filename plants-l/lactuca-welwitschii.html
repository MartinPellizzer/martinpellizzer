<p>Lactuca welwitschii, commonly known as the Namibian lettuce, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It contains lactucopicrin, a sesquiterpene lactone, which gives it a bitter taste and some medicinal properties.</p>
