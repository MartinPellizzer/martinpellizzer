<p>Ludwigia peploides subsp.</p>
<p>peploides, commonly known as the velvetleaf water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and covered with a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. Its small, yellow flowers are borne in clusters and bloom from summer to autumn.</p>
<p>It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
