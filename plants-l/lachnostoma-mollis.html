                <h1>Lachnostoma mollis</h1>
<p>Lachnostoma mollis, commonly known as the soft lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a delicate, leaf-like structure with a thin, spongy upper surface and a more robust, granular lower layer. The thallus is typically greenish to yellowish, with a dense network of hyphae that contribute to its structural integrity. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
