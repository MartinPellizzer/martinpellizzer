                    <h1>Lantana scabrida</h1>
<p>Lantana scabrida, commonly known as rough lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces small, elliptical fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
