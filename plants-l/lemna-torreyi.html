                    <h1>Lemna torreyi</h1>
<p>Lemna torreyi, commonly known as the floating watermeal, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, often floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces vegetatively through the production of small, free-floating offspring called tubers.</p>
<p>Lemna torreyi is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
