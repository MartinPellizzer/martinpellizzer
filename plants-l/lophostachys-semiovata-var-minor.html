                    <h1>Lophostachys semiovata var. minor</h1>
<p>Lophostachys semiovata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf red sandrat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically reddish in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is a hardy, resilient plant that thrives in harsh, desert-like conditions.</p>
