<p>Ligeophila jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's lichen, is a unique species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, flat layer on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, moist environments. The thallus is pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It is primarily found in temperate regions, often on limestone or sandstone substrates.</p>
<p>This lichen is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in soil formation and its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
