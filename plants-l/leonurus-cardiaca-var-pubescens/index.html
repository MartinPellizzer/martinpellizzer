                            <h1>Leonurus Cardiaca Var. Pubescens</h1>
<p>Common hare's-foot, scientifically known as Leonurus cardiaca var. pubescens, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is commonly found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in moist and well-drained conditions. The plant is distinguished by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its common name is derived from its fuzzy, foot-like appearance and its association with rabbits. This versatile plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
