<p>Lycopodioides canescens, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to arid and rocky habitats, it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Its historical significance in paleobotany highlights its role in the evolution of early land plants.</p>
