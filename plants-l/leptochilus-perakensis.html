                    <h1>Leptochilus perakensis</h1>
<p>Leptochilus perakensis, commonly known as the Perak rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Malaysia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has delicate, lanceolate fronds with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and it produces small, sporangium-bearing sori along the margins of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptochilus perakensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment.</p>
