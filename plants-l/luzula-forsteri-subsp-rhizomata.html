<p>Luzula forsteri subsp.</p>
<p>rhizomata, commonly known as the rhizomatous wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
<p>The rhizomatous stems allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
