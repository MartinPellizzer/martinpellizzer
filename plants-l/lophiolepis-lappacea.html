<p>Lophiolepis lappacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on rocks and tree bark in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
