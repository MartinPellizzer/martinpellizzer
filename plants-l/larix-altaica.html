<p>Larix altaica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn, giving it a striking seasonal appearance. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is lightweight and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Larix altaica plays an important ecological role in boreal and subarctic regions by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
