<p>Leptorkis guingangae, commonly known as the Guingang rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and possesses delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
