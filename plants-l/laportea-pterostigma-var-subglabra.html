                    <h1>Laportea pterostigma var. subglabra</h1>
<p>Laportea pterostigma var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes true nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to hybridize with other Laportea species, contributing to its variability in morphology.</p>
