                    <h1>Lathyrus cryophilus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus cryophilus, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods containing kidney-shaped seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lathyrus cryophilus thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing at high elevations where temperatures are cool.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
