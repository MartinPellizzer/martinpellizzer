                    <h1>Limnocharis parviflora</h1>
<p>Limnocharis parviflora, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like leaves that float on the surface of water, with each leaf having a spongy, waxy texture that helps it stay buoyant. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
