<p>Loroglossum formosum, commonly known as the Formosan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant blooms that typically feature a mix of white, purple, and pink hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-draining soil. Its unique floral structure includes a specialized lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Loroglossum formosum is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
