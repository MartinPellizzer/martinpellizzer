                    <h1>Lespedeza cuneata var. serpens</h1>
<p>Lespedeza cuneata var. serpens, commonly known as creeping lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively across open ground. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by clusters of small, oblong seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>This species is often used in erosion control due to its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
