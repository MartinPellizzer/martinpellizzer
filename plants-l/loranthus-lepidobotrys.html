                    <h1>Loranthus lepidobotrys</h1>
<p>Loranthus lepidobotrys, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the savanna regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for various bird species.</p>
<p>Its presence can sometimes weaken or even kill its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
