                    <h1>Lycopodium arbusculum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium arbusculum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that typically grows in dense, low mats. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are called strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear the spores. Lycopodium arbusculum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
