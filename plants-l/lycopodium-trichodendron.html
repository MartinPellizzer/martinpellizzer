<p>Lycopodium trichodendron, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporophylls that bear spores, typical of ancient plant groups. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves a dominant sporophyte generation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Lycopodium trichodendron plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
