                    <h1>Lysinema ciliatum var. gracile</h1>
<p>Lysinema ciliatum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender ciliate lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinct, leaf-like structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions. The thallus is pale to dark green, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface, and it often has a distinctive ciliate margin. It is characterized by its slow growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
