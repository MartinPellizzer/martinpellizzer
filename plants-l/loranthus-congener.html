                    <h1>Loranthus congener</h1>
<p>Loranthus congener, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in dense forests.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree, sometimes leading to its death if the infestation is severe.</p>
