<p>Lycopodium mooreanum, commonly known as the Moorean clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Lycopodium mooreanum is adapted to humid climates and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
