<p>Lecointea lasiogyne, commonly known as the woolly lecointea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, woolly texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
