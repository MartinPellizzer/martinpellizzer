<p>Lobelia koolauensis, commonly known as Koolau lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lobelia koolauensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
