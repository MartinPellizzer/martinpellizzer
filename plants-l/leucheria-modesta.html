<p>Leucheria modesta, commonly known as the modest lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to dark green thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form, adhering closely to the surfaces it colonizes. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. Leucheria modesta is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it an important indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
