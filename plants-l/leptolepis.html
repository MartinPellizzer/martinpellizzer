                    <h1>Leptolepis</h1>
<p>Leptolepis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosettes of leaves and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Leptolepis species are often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their hardy nature.</p>
