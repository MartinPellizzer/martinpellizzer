                    <h1>Lecanopteris varians</h1>
<p>Lecanopteris varians, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Lecanopteris varians is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
