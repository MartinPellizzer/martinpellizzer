<p>Lagenocarpus strictus var. junciformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense, grass-like clusters with narrow, linear leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like inflorescences, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water retention in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth form compared to other species in the genus.</p>
