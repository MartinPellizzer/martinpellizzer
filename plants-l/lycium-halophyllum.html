<p>Lycium halophyllum, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. It thrives in coastal areas and salt-affected soils due to its high salt tolerance.</p>
<p>Lycium halophyllum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
