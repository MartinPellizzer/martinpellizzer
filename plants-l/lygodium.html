                    <h1>Lygodium</h1>
<p>Lygodium, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Lygodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often spirally arranged fronds and their ability to climb using specialized rhizomes. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Lygodium species often have small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of their leaves, which play a key role in their reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Their intricate morphology makes them an important subject in the study of fern evolution and plant ecology.</p>
