<p>Limnorchis yosemitensis, commonly known as the Yosemite water shield, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Sierra Nevada region of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broadly oval and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Limnorchis yosemitensis thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
