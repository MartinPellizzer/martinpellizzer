                    <h1>Lappago occidentalis</h1>
<p>Lappago occidentalis, commonly known as the western lappago, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lappago occidentalis plays a minor but important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its arid environment.</p>
