                    <h1>Lepidaria macrophylla</h1>
<p>Lepidaria macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure.</p>
<p>It features a dense, crust-like thallus with a thick, leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant's lobed and wrinkled surface is covered in small, rounded lobes that aid in nutrient absorption. It typically grows on rocks, soil, or bark in temperate regions, thriving in shaded, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its complex symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi, which supports its growth and survival.</p>
