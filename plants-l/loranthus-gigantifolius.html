                    <h1>Loranthus gigantifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus gigantifolius, commonly known as the giant-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are large, ovate, and have a waxy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Loranthus gigantifolius is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions.</p>
