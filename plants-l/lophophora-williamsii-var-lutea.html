                    <h1>Lophophora williamsii var. lutea</h1>
<p>Lophophora williamsii var. lutea, commonly known as the golden peyote, is a variant of the peyote cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a yellowish to orange hue, distinguishing it from the more common blue-green peyote. The plant produces white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-yellow body. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also known for its cultural and spiritual significance among indigenous communities.</p>
