                    <h1>Loranthus oleifolius var. elegans</h1>
<p>Loranthus oleifolius var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
