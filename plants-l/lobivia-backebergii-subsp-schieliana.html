<p>Lobivia backebergii subsp.</p>
<p>schieliana, commonly known as the Schiel's lobivia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on racemes at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and collections of succulents.</p>
