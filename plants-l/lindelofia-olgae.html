<p>Lindelofia olgae, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of fleshy, green pseudobulbs that store water. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Lindelofia olgae thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
