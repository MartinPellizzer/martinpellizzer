                            <h1>Lithocarpus Magnificus</h1>
<p>Lithocarpus magnificus is a striking evergreen tree native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. Known for its large, glossy leaves and distinctive, heavy fruits, this species is a key component of its ecosystem. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is often referred to as the "ironwood" due to its dense, durable timber. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a vital role in supporting biodiversity. Its unique characteristics make it a subject of both ecological and botanical interest.</p>
