<p>Lupinus sericeus subsp.</p>
<p>sericeus, commonly known as silver lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue flowers and finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name.</p>

<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
