                    <h1>Lindsaea coursii</h1>
<p>Lindsaea coursii, commonly known as the Florida lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in humid climates. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that form a dense rosette, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Lindsaea coursii is characterized by its unique morphology and is often found in wetland or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
