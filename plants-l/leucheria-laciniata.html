                    <h1>Leucheria laciniata</h1>
<p>Leucheria laciniata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
