                    <h1>Loranthus seemenianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus seemenianus, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various parts of Africa and plays a role in local ecosystems despite its parasitic nature.</p>
