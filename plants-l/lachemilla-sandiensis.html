                    <h1>Lachemilla sandiensis</h1>
<p>Lachemilla sandiensis, commonly known as the Sand Island lichen, is a member of the Lichens family, specifically the subclass Lecanoromycetes.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is usually pale green to yellowish in color. This lichen is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in low-nutrient conditions. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health in desert ecosystems.</p>
