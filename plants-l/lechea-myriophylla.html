                    <h1>Lechea myriophylla</h1>
<p>Lechea myriophylla, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, which helps it survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lechea myriophylla is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
