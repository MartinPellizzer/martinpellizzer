<p>Lithops schwantesii subsp.</p>
<p>gebseri, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "living stone," is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, which help it blend into its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
