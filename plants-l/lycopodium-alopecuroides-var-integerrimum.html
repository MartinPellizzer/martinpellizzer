<p>Lycopodium alopecuroides var. integerrimum, commonly known as the smooth lycopodium, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The plant has lance-shaped, bright green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
