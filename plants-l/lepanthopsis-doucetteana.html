<p>Lepanthopsis doucetteana, commonly known as the Douglas's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. The plant has strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it grows epiphytically on trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high elevation, often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
