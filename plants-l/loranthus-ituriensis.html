                    <h1>Loranthus ituriensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of Central and Eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the Euphorbiaceae family, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique adaptations make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
