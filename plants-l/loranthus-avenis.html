                    <h1>Loranthus avenis</h1>
<p>Loranthus avenis, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, scale-like leaves and white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and other animals that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Loranthus avenis is an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
