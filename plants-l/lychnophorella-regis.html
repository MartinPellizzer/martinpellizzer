                    <h1>Lychnophorella regis</h1>
<p>Lychnophorella regis, commonly known as the royal lychnophore, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the order Lychnophorales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves and a distinctive, elongated stem that bears small, clustered flowers. The plant is primarily found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Lychnophorella regis is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
