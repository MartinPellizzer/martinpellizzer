                    <h1>Lolium appenninum</h1>
<p>Lolium appenninum, commonly known as Italian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, elongated leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a valuable forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
