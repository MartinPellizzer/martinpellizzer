                    <h1>Llewelynia williamsii</h1>
<p>Llewelynia williamsii, commonly known as the pink ghost fungus, is a rare and striking member of the Agaricaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to reddish cap, which often appears ghostly in forest environments. The gills are initially pink but turn brown with age, and the stem is slender with a fibrous texture. This fungus typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded areas of temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for mycologists and fungal enthusiasts.</p>
