<p>Lupinus chlorolepis, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus chlorolepis is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria.</p>
