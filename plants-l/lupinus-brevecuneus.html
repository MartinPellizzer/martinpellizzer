<p>Lupinus brevecuneus, commonly known as the short-cowpea lupine, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are encased in a leathery pod, typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Lupinus brevecuneus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility in native plant communities.</p>
