                    <h1>Lepidonia corae</h1>
<p>Lepidonia corae, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest understories. Its rhizome system is well-developed, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Lepidonia corae plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>
