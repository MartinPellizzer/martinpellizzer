<p>Laportea stolonifera, commonly known as creeping heartleaf, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Laportea stolonifera is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
