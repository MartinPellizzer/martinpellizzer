                    <h1>Lathraea clandestina f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Lathraea clandestina f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Europe and North Africa. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is specialized to attach to the roots of host plants such as thistles or legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it is often found growing in dry, disturbed soils where its host plants are abundant.</p>
