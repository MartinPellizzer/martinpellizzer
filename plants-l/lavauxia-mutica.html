                    <h1>Lavauxia mutica</h1>
<p>Lavauxia mutica, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats, thriving in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The sticky hairs on its stems and leaves help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
