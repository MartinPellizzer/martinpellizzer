                    <h1>Lycopodium foliosum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium foliosum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte structure that consists of a stem and roots. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium foliosum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
