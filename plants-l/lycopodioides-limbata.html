<p>Lycopodioides limbata, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodioides limbata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living relic of early plant evolution.</p>
