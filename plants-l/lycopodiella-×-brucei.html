                    <h1>Lycopodiella × brucei</h1>
<p>Lycopodiella × brucei, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Lycopodiella cernua and Lycopodiella cernua var. filiformis.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that are typically short and stout, with spore-producing structures called sporangia located at their tips. Lycopodiella × brucei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for studies on hybridization and evolutionary biology in the Lycopodiaceae family.</p>
