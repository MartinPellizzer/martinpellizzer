                    <h1>Lobivia famatinensis var. haematantha</h1>
<p>Lobivia famatinensis var. haematantha, commonly known as the Crimson Lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cylindrical stem with distinctive red or pinkish hues, especially under intense sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the spring. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its striking appearance and adaptability to dry, well-drained soils.</p>
