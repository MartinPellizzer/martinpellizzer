<p>Lycopodioides convoluta, commonly known as the twisted clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces tiny, spiral-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, which are released from small, cone-like structures called strobila.</p>
<p>Lycopodioides convoluta is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for small invertebrates.</p>
