                    <h1>Lappula redowskii f. brachystyla</h1>
<p>Lappula redowskii f. brachystyla, commonly known as the short-styled lappula, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stamens compared to the typical form, a trait that contributes to its unique floral structure. Native to certain regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and adaptation.</p>
