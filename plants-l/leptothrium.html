                    <h1>Leptothrium</h1>
<p>Leptothrium, commonly known as the fern moss or small fern moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Lejeuneaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, mat-forming, and thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. They lack true leaves and instead have structures called thallus, which are flattened, leaf-like bodies. Leptothrium species are often found in temperate regions and are characterized by their intricate, delicate leaf arrangements.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are usually small and clustered, contributing to their role in ecological systems.</p>
