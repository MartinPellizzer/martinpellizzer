<p>Limnochloa mutata, commonly known as the water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, forming a dense mat. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and greenish, appearing in clusters, and it is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Limnochloa mutata plays a role in improving water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
