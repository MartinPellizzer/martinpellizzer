                    <h1>Loranthus landanaensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus landanaensis, commonly known as the Landana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to parts of Central America, particularly in Mexico. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds in return. Its small, clustered leaves are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique parasitic relationship and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
