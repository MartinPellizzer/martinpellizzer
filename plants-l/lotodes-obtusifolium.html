                    <h1>Lotodes obtusifolium</h1>
<p>Lotodes obtusifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in its habitat.</p>
<p>The leaves are thick and waxy, helping to repel water and support the plant's buoyancy.</p>
