                    <h1>Lapiedra chilensis</h1>
<p>Lapiedra chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean rock plant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study in arid ecosystems.</p>
