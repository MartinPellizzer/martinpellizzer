                    <h1>Larrea glandulosa</h1>
<p>Larrea glandulosa, commonly known as greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in low-water environments. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Larrea glandulosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
