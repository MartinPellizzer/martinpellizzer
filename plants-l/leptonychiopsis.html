<p>Leptonychiopsis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a type of cup-like structure. The plants are typically found in arid or rocky environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. They are native to regions in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Leptonychiopsis species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
