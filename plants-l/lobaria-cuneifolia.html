<p>Lobaria cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lung lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leaf-like thallus with a distinctive, irregularly lobed structure. The upper surface is typically pale green to yellowish, while the lower surface is dark and covered with soredia. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality.</p>
