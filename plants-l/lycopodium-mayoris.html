<p>Lycopodium mayoris, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that form compact, bushy clusters. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. Lycopodium mayoris typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
