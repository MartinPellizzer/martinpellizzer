<p>Lycopodium echinatum, commonly known as the spiny clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that develop into spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium echinatum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
