                    <h1>Leucorchis albida var. tricuspis</h1>
<p>Leucorchis albida var. tricuspis, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves and its unique, white, three-lobed flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
