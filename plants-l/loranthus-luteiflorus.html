                    <h1>Loranthus luteiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus luteiflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
