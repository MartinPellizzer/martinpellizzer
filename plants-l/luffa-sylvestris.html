<p>Luffa sylvestris, commonly known as wild luffa, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to fibrous, sponge-like fruits. These fruits are typically harvested when mature, revealing a spongy interior that can be used as a natural exfoliant.</p>
<p>Luffa sylvestris is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
