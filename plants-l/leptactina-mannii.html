<p>Leptactina mannii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, making it drought-resistant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Leptactina mannii is also valued for its traditional uses in medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>
