                    <h1>Lachnostoma caucanum</h1>
<p>Lachnostoma caucanum, commonly known as the Caucasian lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a distinctive, flattened structure. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which together carry out photosynthesis. It is often found growing on tree bark and rocks in temperate and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject in ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
