                    <h1>Lactuca quercus</h1>
<p>Lactuca quercus, commonly known as the oak lettuce, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and slightly lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter flavor, often used in salads or as a garnish.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than other lettuce varieties due to its specific growing requirements.</p>
