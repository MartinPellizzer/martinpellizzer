Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, acidic soils in forest understories. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, with sporophytes producing spores in specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects ancient evolutionary traits, making it a valuable subject for botanical study.</p>
