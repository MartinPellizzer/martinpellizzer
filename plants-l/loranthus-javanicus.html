                    <h1>Loranthus javanicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus javanicus, commonly known as the Java mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, drawing water and minerals through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to the feathers of birds, facilitating seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Loranthus javanicus plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for certain bird species and insects.</p>
