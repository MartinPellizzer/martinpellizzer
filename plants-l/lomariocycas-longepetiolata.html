                    <h1>Lomariocycas longepetiolata</h1>
<p>Lomariocycas longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, emerging from a stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
