                    <h1>Laurus nobilis var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Laurus nobilis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved laurel, is a cultivar of the bay laurel plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the standard Laurus nobilis. The plant is evergreen, with a dense, compact growth habit that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental use. Its leaves have a strong aromatic scent and are used in cooking, similar to the common bay leaf.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellowish-green, appearing in spring, followed by small, dark blue berries.</p>
