<p>Lachnopylis angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan lichen, is a unique plant species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, which is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically an alga or cyanobacterium. This species is characterized by its crust-like growth form, often adhering tightly to rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. Lachnopylis angolensis plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
