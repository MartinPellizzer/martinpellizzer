<p>Lasiorrhiza barrasiana, commonly known as the Barras's grass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass species native to South Africa, characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it reflect sunlight in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Lasiorrhiza barrasiana is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas.</p>
