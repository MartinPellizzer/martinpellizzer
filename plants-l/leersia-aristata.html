                    <h1>Leersia aristata</h1>
<p>Leersia aristata, commonly known as purple moorgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in moist areas.</p>
<p>Leersia aristata is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in water gardens.</p>
