<p>Litobrochia berteroana, commonly known as the Bertero's rock-moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and photosynthetic. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized leaf-like organs called gemma cups.</p>
