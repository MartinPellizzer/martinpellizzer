                    <h1>Loranthus luteovittatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus luteovittatus, commonly known as the yellow-striped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is native to southeastern Australia and is often found in coastal and riverine habitats.</p>
