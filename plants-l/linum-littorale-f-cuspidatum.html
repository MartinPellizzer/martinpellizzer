                    <h1>Linum littorale f. cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Linum littorale f. cuspidatum, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters along the shoreline. The plant produces small, blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaf tips, giving it the specific epithet *cuspidatum*.</p>
