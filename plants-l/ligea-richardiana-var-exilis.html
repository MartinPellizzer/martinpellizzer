                    <h1>Ligea richardiana var. exilis</h1>
<p>Ligea richardiana var. exilis, commonly known as the slender ligea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery绒毛, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
