                    <h1>Lepanthes austinae</h1>
<p>Lepanthes austinae, commonly known as the Austina's slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes austinae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
