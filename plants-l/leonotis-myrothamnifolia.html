                    <h1>Leonotis myrothamnifolia</h1>
<p>Leonotis myrothamnifolia, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like clusters of bright orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and its vibrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of cardiac glycosides.</p>
