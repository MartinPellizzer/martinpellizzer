<p>Lonicera periclymenum, commonly known as the honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, often fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Its twining stems allow it to climb or trail along supports, and it is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows.</p>
<p>Lonicera periclymenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
