                    <h1>Loranthus stuhlmannii</h1>
<p>Loranthus stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also obtaining some photosynthetic products from its own small leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in forested areas.</p>
