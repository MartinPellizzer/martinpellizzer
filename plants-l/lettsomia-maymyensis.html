<p>Lettsomia maymyensis, commonly known as the Maymyen orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit, with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that can last several weeks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lettsomia maymyensis is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
