                    <h1>Loranthus pendulus var. miquelii</h1>
<p>Loranthus pendulus var. miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
