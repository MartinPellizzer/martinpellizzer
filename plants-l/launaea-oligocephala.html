<p>Launaea oligocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flower heads produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seeds, aiding in wind pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
