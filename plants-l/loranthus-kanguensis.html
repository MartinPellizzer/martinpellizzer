                    <h1>Loranthus kanguensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus kanguensis, commonly known as the Kangu mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the African savanna.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through bird droppings, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and providing food for various animals.</p>
