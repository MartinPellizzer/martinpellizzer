<p>Lachemilla vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic moss, is a low-growing plant native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, acidic soils found in areas with volcanic activity. The plant has dense, mat-like foliage that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or brown, adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Lachemilla vulcanica plays an important ecological role in volcanic ecosystems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
