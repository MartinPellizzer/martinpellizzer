<p>Luffa acutangula var. subangulata, commonly known as the angular luffa, is a tropical climbing vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, angular, and ridged stems that become fibrous and spongy as they mature. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow, monoecious flowers, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its fruits are elongated, cylindrical, and develop a rough, fibrous exterior that turns woody with age.</p>
<p>This variety is cultivated for its mature fruit, which is used as a natural sponge after the outer layers are removed.</p>
