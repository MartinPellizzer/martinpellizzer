<p>Ligeophila juruenensis, commonly known as the Juruenensis fern, is a rare and lesser-known species of fern found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ligeophila juruenensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
