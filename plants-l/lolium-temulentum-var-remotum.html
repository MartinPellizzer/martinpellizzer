                    <h1>Lolium temulentum var. remotum</h1>
<p>Lolium temulentum var. remotum, commonly known as the "wild ryegrass," is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
