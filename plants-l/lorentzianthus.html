The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lorentzianthus is considered an endangered species due to habitat destruction and limited distribution.</p>
