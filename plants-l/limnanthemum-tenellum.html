<p>Limnanthemum tenellum, commonly known as the slender water violet, is a delicate aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features small, floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces tiny, pale yellow flowers with five petals. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it to the pond bottom while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Limnanthemum tenellum plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and is sometimes used in ornamental water gardens.</p>
