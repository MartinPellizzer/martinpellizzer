                    <h1>Leachia sociara</h1>
<p>Leachia sociara, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique and ancient tree native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like crown and scale-like leaves, which are adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. The plant belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is known for its slow growth and longevity, with some specimens living for hundreds of years. Its cones are small and produce winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological and evolutionary significance, Leachia sociara is considered a living fossil and a symbol of the island's unique biodiversity.</p>
