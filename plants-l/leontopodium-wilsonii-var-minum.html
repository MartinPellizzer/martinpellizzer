The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to low temperatures and strong sunlight. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
