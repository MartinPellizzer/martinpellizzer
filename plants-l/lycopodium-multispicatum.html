                    <h1>Lycopodium multispicatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium multispicatum, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its dense, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, which is typically prostrate or creeping. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, a feature typical of lycophytes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living relic of early plant evolution.</p>
