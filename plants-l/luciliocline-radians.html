<p>Luciliocline radians, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via lightweight, parachute-like structures.</p>
<p>Luciliocline radians is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
