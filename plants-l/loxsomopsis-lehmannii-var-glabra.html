                    <h1>Loxsomopsis lehmannii var. glabra</h1>
<p>Loxsomopsis lehmannii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth lehmann's lichen, is a crustose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale yellow to orange-brown thallus that forms a continuous layer on rock surfaces. The plant lacks distinct lobes and has a uniform texture, making it difficult to distinguish from other similar lichens without microscopic examination. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, growing on limestone and sandstone substrates.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
