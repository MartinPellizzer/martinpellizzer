                    <h1>Loranthus patentiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus patentiflorus, commonly known as the broad-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions of Africa and is often found on trees such as acacia and eucalyptus. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds, which can germinate on the bark of host trees.</p>
