<p>Leucopsis sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive silvery-white upper surface covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish-green, with a soft, leathery texture. It is often found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen plays an important role in nutrient cycling and serves as a bioindicator of air quality.</p>
