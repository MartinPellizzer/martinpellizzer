                    <h1>Ligea alcicornis</h1>
<p>Ligea alcicornis, commonly known as the silver-veined orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that have a silvery-blue sheen due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale purple and white, arranged in loose clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to prevent leaf scorch.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ligea alcicornis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
