                    <h1>Loranthus jodoniki</h1>
<p>Loranthus jodoniki, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus jodoniki is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
