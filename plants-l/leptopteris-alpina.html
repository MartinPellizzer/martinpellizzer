                    <h1>Leptopteris alpina</h1>
<p>Leptopteris alpina, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across wetland areas. Its spores are released from sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Leptopteris alpina plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of alpine and mountainous freshwater habitats.</p>
