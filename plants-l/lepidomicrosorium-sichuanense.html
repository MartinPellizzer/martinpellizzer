                    <h1>Lepidomicrosorium sichuanense</h1>
<p>Lepidomicrosorium sichuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments with moderate light and nutrient-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
