<p>Leucheria pteropogon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
