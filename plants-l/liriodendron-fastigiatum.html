<p>Liriodendron fastigiatum, commonly known as the tulip tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broadly oval shape, with dark green, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces showy, yellow-green, tulip-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The tulip tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also important in ecological systems.</p>
