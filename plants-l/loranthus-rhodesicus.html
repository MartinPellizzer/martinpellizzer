                    <h1>Loranthus rhodesicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus rhodesicus, commonly known as the Rhodes holly or Rhodes mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is native to parts of Africa, including South Africa, and is often found on trees such as acacia and eucalyptus.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
