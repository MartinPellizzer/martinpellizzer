<p>Lesquerella arctica var. scammaniae, commonly known as Arctic lesquerella, is a rare and cold-tolerant plant native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and hairy, low-growing stems. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme cold and short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
