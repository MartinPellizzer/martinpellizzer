                    <h1>Lithops marlothii</h1>
<p>Lithops marlothii, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "living stone," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant's leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. Lithops marlothii produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle contrast to its rocky appearance.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it well adapted to its natural habitat, where it blends seamlessly with the surrounding landscape.</p>
