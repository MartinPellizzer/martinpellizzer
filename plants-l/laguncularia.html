                    <h1>Laguncularia</h1>
<p>Laguncularia, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a salt-tolerant evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to exude a resinous substance that helps it withstand saltwater. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Laguncularia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
