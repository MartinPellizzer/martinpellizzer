<p>Lathyrus palustris subsp.</p>
<p>pilosus, commonly known as the hairy marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The subspecies pilosus is distinguished by its hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in damp environments. It produces small, lens-shaped legumes that contain the plant's seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in wet areas and provides food for various insects and wildlife.</p>
