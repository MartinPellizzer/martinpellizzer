                    <h1>Leptochloris</h1>
<p>Leptochloris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble the color of the surrounding foliage, helping it blend into its environment. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on epiphytic growth for nutrients and moisture. Its roots are specialized for absorbing water and nutrients from the air, soil, and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Leptochloris is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
