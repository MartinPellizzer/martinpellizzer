                    <h1>Larnax psilophyta</h1>
<p>Larnax psilophyta, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lepidoziellales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome that produces upright, spore-bearing cones. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Larnax psilophyta exhibits a unique reproductive structure with distinct sporophyte and gametophyte phases.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology reflects its evolutionary position as a transitional form between non-vascular and more advanced vascular plants.</p>
