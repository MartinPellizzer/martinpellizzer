                    <h1>Lycopodium ulixis</h1>
<p>Lycopodium ulixis, commonly known as the ground pine, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the clubmoss family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is dominant in its life cycle. Lycopodium ulixis typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of spores for scientific study highlights its ecological and botanical significance.</p>
