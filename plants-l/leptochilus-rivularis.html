<p>Leptochilus rivularis, commonly known as the water bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which help it float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually filamentous and lack true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage.</p>
<p>Leptochilus rivularis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters.</p>
