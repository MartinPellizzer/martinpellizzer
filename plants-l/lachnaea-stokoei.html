                    <h1>Lachnaea stokoei</h1>
<p>Lachnaea stokoei, commonly known as the Stokoe's lichen, is a rare and specialized foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus with a distinctive yellowish to orange coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of green algae, which contributes to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on bark or soil in temperate forests, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lachnaea stokoei is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
