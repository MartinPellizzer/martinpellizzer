                    <h1>Loranthus tehuacanensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus tehuacanensis, commonly known as the Tehuac√°n mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. It is native to Mexico and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem.</p>
