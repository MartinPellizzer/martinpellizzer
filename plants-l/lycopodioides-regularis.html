<p>Lycopodioides regularis, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, upright, branched stem. The plant produces spores in sporangia that are clustered in strobila, which are cone-like structures at the tips of the branches. Lycopodioides regularis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a primitive vascular plant with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
