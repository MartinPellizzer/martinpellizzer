<p>Lycopodioides brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged spirally. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, with sporangia clustered in strobila at the tips of its branches.</p>
<p>Lycopodioides brevipes is an ancient lineage of plants, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats.</p>
