<p>Lithops lericheana, commonly known as the Cape Town stone plant, is a member of the Aizoaceae family and is native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, leaf-like structures that resemble small stones, which help it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces striking flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry climates.</p>
<p>Lithops lericheana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
