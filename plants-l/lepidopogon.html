<p>Lepidopogon, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grassy leaves and small, clustered flowers. Lepidopogon species typically grow in moist or wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plants have a rhizomatous root system that helps them spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
