                    <h1>Lychnis apetala var. nutans</h1>
<p>Lychnis apetala var. nutans, commonly known as the drooping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that produce small, white or pink flowers with five petals. The plant has no true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures called phyllodes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
