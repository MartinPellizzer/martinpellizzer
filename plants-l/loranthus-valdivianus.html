<p>Loranthus valdivianus, commonly known as the Valdivian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native South American trees such as the southern beech (Nothofagus).</p>
<p>It has a smooth, waxy leaf surface and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while also contributing to the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume its fleshy, red berries.</p>
