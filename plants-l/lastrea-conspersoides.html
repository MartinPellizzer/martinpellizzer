<p>Lastrea conspersoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in moisture retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
