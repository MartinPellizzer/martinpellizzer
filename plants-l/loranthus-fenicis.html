                    <h1>Loranthus fenicis</h1>
<p>Loranthus fenicis, commonly known as the sacred or holy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to various host trees, primarily those in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries, which are often used in traditional medicine and rituals. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, and it is found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
