                    <h1>Loranthus rotundatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus rotundatus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that contain sticky seeds. These seeds adhere to the bark of trees and can germinate in the presence of a suitable host.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important part of the ecosystem, supporting various bird species that eat its berries.</p>
