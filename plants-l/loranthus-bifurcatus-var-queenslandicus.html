                    <h1>Loranthus bifurcatus var. queenslandicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus bifurcatus var. queenslandicus, commonly known as the Queensland mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalypts.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically orange or red, containing sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees for dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is native to eastern Australia and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
