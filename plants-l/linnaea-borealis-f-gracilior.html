<p>Linnaea borealis f. gracilior, commonly known as the slender twinflower, is a rare and delicate variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters of two. The plant has creeping stems that form a dense mat, and its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its more slender growth habit and smaller flowers compared to the typical Linnaea borealis.</p>
