<p>Loxogramme dictyopteris, commonly known as the common water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It features delicate, floating leaves that are divided into numerous narrow segments, resembling the structure of a clover leaf. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes anchor it to submerged surfaces, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its simple, non-branching fronds and is often found in association with other aquatic flora.</p>
