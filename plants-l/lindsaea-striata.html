<p>Lindsaea striata, commonly known as the streaked lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with fine, parallel veins. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>Lindsaea striata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
