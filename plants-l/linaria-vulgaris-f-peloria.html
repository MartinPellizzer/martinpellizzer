                    <h1>Linaria vulgaris f. peloria</h1>
<p>Linaria vulgaris f. peloria, commonly known as the "peloric foxglove," is a variant of the common toadflax.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, where the typical two-lipped flowers are replaced by a single, large, bell-shaped corolla. This mutation results from a genetic anomaly that affects the development of floral parts. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
