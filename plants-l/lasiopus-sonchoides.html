<p>Lasiopus sonchoides, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous branched stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Lasiopus sonchoides is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sandy conditions.</p>
