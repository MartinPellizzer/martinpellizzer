                    <h1>Lycopodium cernuum var. curvatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium cernuum var. curvatum, commonly known as the drooping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color, arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in North America, it thrives in forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of understory vegetation in temperate regions.</p>
