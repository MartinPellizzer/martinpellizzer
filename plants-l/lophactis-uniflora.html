                    <h1>Lophactis uniflora</h1>
<p>Lophactis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower lophactis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypselae.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lophactis uniflora is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
