                    <h1>Lepisorus lancifolius</h1>
<p>Lepisorus lancifolius, commonly known as the needle-leaf polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Lepisorus lancifolius thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
