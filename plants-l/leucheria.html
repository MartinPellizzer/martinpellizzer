                    <h1>Leucheria</h1>
<p>Leucheria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Leucheria is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on trees or in shaded, moist environments. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and specific habitat requirements, Leucheria is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
