<p>Limnorchis hologlottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. It is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Limnorchis hologlottis plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
