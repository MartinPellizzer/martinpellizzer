                    <h1>Leptactina polyneura</h1>
<p>Leptactina polyneura, commonly known as the narrow-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
