                            <h1>Lycianthes Chiapensis</h1>
<p>Lycianthes chiapensis is a lesser-known member of the Solanaceae family native to the tropical regions of Central America. This plant is often found in humid lowland forests and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Its berries, though not widely cultivated, are edible and have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Due to habitat loss, Lycianthes chiapensis faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
