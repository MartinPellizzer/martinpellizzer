                    <h1>Loxostigma longicaule</h1>
<p>Loxostigma longicaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in temperate regions and is relatively uncommon, making it a subject of interest for lichenologists.</p>
<p>Its morphology and habitat make it an important indicator of environmental conditions in its ecosystem.</p>
