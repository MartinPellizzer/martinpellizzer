                    <h1>Leptochlaena</h1>
<p>Leptochlaena, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a genus of small, delicate ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>These plants typically have slender, wiry stems and produce small, finely divided fronds that give them a feathery appearance. The leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Leptochlaena species often grow in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
