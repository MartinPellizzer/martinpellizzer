<p>Lancisia lobata, commonly known as the giant antbird tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its size and habitat requirements, it is considered a keystone species in certain tropical ecosystems.</p>
