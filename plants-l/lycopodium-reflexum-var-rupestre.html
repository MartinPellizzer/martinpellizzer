                    <h1>Lycopodium reflexum var. rupestre</h1>
<p>Lycopodium reflexum var. rupestre, commonly known as the rock lycopod, is a species of clubmoss that thrives in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, which allows it to anchor itself in crevices. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including drought and poor soil quality.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in Mediterranean climates and is valued for its resilience and unique appearance in horticultural settings.</p>
