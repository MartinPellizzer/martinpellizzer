                    <h1>Lastrea calcarata var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Lastrea calcarata var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in fine, hair-like structures called cilia, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance.</p>
