                            <h1>Linaria Alpina F. Pilosa</h1>
<p>Alpine toadflax, scientifically known as Linaria alpina f. pilosa, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh conditions with its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its hairy leaves and stems provide a unique texture, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
