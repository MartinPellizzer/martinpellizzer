                            <h1>Leonurus Cardiaca Var. Royleana</h1>
<p>Heartworts, scientifically known as Leonurus cardiaca var. royleana, are small, herbaceous plants native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. Often mistaken for common heartworts due to their similar appearance, this variant is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and subtle floral structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its name is derived from the heart-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive and somewhat whimsical appearance. Despite its delicate look, this plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by supporting insect life and contributing to soil stability.</p>
