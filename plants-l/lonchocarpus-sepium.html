                    <h1>Lonchocarpus sepium</h1>
<p>Lonchocarpus sepium, commonly known as the climbing pigeonwood, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody vines and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces distinctive yellow or orange flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing flattened, dark brown seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native ecosystems.</p>
