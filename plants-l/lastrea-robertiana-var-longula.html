<p>Lastrea robertiana var. longula, commonly known as the long-leaf lastrea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
