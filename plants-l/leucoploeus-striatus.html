                    <h1>Leucoploeus striatus</h1>
<p>Leucoploeus striatus, commonly known as the silver-streaked orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale green flowers with distinctive silver streaks. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives on decomposing organic matter. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, slender stem that bears the flowering spikes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucoploeus striatus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
