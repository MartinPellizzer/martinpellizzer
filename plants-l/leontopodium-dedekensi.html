<p>Leontopodium dedekensi, commonly known as the Dedekens' edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy yellow flower heads. The plant thrives in harsh, rocky environments where it forms a low-growing mat. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to the rugged landscape.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
