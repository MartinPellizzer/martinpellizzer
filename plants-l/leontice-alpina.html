                    <h1>Leontice alpina</h1>
<p>Leontice alpina, commonly known as alpine leontice, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to the harsh conditions of its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Leontice alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine environments.</p>
