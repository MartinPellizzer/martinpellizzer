                    <h1>Ledermanniella thalloidea</h1>
<p>Ledermanniella thalloidea, commonly known as the flat thalloid lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its broad, flat thallus that often forms dense mats on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal mycobiont, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its surface is usually smooth or slightly lobed, with a pale to dark green or yellowish coloration.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
