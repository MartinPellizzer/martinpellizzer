                    <h1>Ledum palustre var. nipponicum</h1>
<p>Ledum palustre var. nipponicum, commonly known as Japanese cross-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically crossed by prominent veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that are pinkish-white in color, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in boggy or swampy areas.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the more widely known Ledum palustre, but it is distinguished by its unique leaf structure and geographic origin.</p>
