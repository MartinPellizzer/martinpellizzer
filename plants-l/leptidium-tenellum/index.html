                            <h1>Leptidium Tenellum</h1>
<p>Leptidium tenellum is a small, herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in harsh, cold environments where few other plants can survive. This species is often found growing in rocky soils and on mountain slopes. Its compact size and resilience make it a notable member of the Brassicaceae family. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in its ecosystem.</p>
