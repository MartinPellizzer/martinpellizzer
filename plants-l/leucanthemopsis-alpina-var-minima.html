                    <h1>Leucanthemopsis alpina var. minima</h1>
<p>Leucanthemopsis alpina var. minima, commonly known as the alpine ragwort, is a small, perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense cushions to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces yellow flowers with prominent white ray florets. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil depth.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in alpine gardens.</p>
