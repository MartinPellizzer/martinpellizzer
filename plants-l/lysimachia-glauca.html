                    <h1>Lysimachia glauca</h1>
<p>Lysimachia glauca, commonly known as golden creeping-jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
