                    <h1>Loranthus urdanetensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus urdanetensis, commonly known as the UrdaNet mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the subtropical and tropical regions of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Colombia. This plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the Fabaceae and Myrtaceae families, through its haustellum, which allows it to draw water and nutrients. Loranthus urdanetensis produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
