<p>Leleba pachinensis var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy leleba, is a lesser-known species within the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woolly flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
