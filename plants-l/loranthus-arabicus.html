                    <h1>Loranthus arabicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It thrives in arid environments and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
