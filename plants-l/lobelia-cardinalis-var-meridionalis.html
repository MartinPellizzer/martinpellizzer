                    <h1>Lobelia cardinalis var. meridionalis</h1>
<p>Lobelia cardinalis var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern cardinalflower, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the more widely known Lobelia cardinalis, but it is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and geographic distribution.</p>
