                    <h1>Larix potaninii var. potaninii</h1>
<p>Larix potaninii var. potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, feathery foliage that turns a vibrant yellow before shedding in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine forests and rocky slopes.</p>
