<p>Loxocarya gigas, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a unique organism that belongs to the lichenized fungi group.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. This plant-like structure is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in cool, moist environments. Its growth is slow, and it can live for centuries, making it an indicator of environmental stability.</p>
<p>The thallus of Loxocarya gigas is usually crust-like or foliose, varying in color from green to yellowish depending on the species.</p>
