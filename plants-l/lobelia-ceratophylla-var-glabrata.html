                    <h1>Lobelia ceratophylla var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Lobelia ceratophylla var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leafed lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, smooth leaves and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The variety 'glabrata' distinguishes itself from the typical lobelia by its lack of hairy foliage.</p>
