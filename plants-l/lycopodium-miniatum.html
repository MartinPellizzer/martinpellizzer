<p>Lycopodium miniatum, commonly known as the miniature clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodium miniatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of understory plant communities.</p>
