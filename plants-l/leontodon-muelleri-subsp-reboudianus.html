<p>Leontodon muelleri subsp.</p>
<p>reboudianus, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering period compared to other members of the Leontodon genus.</p>
