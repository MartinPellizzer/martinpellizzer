                    <h1>Lamourouxia breviflora</h1>
<p>Lamourouxia breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered lamourouxia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and compound leaves with a pinnate structure, often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
