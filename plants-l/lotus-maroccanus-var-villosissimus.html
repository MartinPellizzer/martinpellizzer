                    <h1>Lotus maroccanus var. villosissimus</h1>
<p>Lotus maroccanus var. villosissimus, commonly known as the Moroccan hairy lotus, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
