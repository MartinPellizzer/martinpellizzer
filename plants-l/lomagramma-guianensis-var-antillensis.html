                    <h1>Lomagramma guianensis var. antillensis</h1>
<p>Lomagramma guianensis var. antillensis, commonly known as the Antillean lomagramma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean and northern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lomagrammaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid lowland forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
