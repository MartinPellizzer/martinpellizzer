<p>Lophophora williamsii var. pluricostata, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Dead," is a rare and striking cacti species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-gray in color, with a unique, flattened shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are often short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. It has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
