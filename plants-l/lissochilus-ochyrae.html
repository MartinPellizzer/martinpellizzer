<p>Lissochilus ochyrae, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
