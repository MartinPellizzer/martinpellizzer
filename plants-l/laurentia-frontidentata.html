<p>Laurentia frontidentata, commonly known as the broadleaf water willow, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil along water edges.</p>
<p>Laurentia frontidentata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
