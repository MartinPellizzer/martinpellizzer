<p>Linaria repens subsp.</p>
<p>blanca, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, covered with small, hairy leaves.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically bright yellow or orange, though the subspecies blanca is distinguished by its white or pale yellow blooms. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
