                    <h1>Lawsonia falcata</h1>
<p>Lawsonia falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved henna, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
