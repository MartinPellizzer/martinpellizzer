<p>Linguella nana, commonly known as the dwarf linguella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by berry-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
