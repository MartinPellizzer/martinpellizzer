<p>Lophosoria quadripinnata var. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in water gardens.</p>
