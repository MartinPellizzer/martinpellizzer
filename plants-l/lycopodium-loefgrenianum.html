                    <h1>Lycopodium loefgrenianum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium loefgrenianum, commonly known as the Loefgren's clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, which are typically found at the base of its foliage. L. loefgrenianum is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is often found in forest undergrowth where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
