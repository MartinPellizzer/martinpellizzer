                    <h1>Loranthus carvalhi</h1>
<p>Loranthus carvalhi, commonly known as the Portuguese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This parasitic relationship can weaken the host tree over time, making it an ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
