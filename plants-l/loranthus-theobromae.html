                    <h1>Loranthus theobromae</h1>
<p>Loranthus theobromae, commonly known as the cocoa dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily those in the Theobroma genus, such as cacao trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves both vegetative and reproductive stages. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host plants thrive.</p>
<p>Its presence can impact the health and productivity of its host, particularly in agricultural settings.</p>
