                    <h1>Lapidia</h1>
<p>Lapidia, commonly known as the "stone plant," is a unique succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that resemble small stones, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, tall flower spikes with clusters of yellow or orange flowers during the growing season. Lapidia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and minimal care requirements make it a popular ornamental plant among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
