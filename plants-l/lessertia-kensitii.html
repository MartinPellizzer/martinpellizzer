<p>Lessertia kensitii, commonly known as the Kentsville fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays due to their ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces spores in small, round clusters on the underside of its leaves, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
