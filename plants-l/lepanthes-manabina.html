<p>Lepanthes manabina, commonly known as the Manab√≠ orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as white, yellow, or orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepanthes manabina is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
