                    <h1>Lonchostoma elegans</h1>
<p>Lonchostoma elegans, commonly known as the elegant lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, greenish to yellowish thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
