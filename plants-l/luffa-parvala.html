<p>Luffa parvala, commonly known as the Indian sponge gourd, is a tropical vine native to Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant produces elongated, hollow fruits that mature into spongy, fibrous structures. These fibrous parts are often used in natural exfoliation and as a biodegradable sponge.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in warm climates make it a popular crop in many regions.</p>
