                    <h1>Lathyrus sativus var. angustatus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus sativus var. angustatus, commonly known as narrowleaf grasspea, is a variant of the grasspea plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is an annual legume characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing 1â€“4 elliptical seeds, which are used as a food source in some parts of the world. It is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often cultivated as a drought-resistant crop.</p>
<p>However, like other members of the Lathyrus genus, it contains toxic alkaloids that can pose health risks if consumed in large quantities.</p>
