<p>Lupinus angustifolius subsp.</p>
<p>brachystachys, commonly known as narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and dense clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, improving soil fertility.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
