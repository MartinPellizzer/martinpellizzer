<p>Ledebouria edulis, commonly known as the edible bulbous plant, is a species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy bulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are strap-shaped and evergreen, providing a striking visual contrast to the flowering stems.</p>
<p>While the bulbs are edible when cooked, the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful preparation.</p>
