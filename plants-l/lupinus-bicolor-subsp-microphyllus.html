<p>Lupinus bicolor subsp.</p>
<p>microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of pea-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes.</p>
