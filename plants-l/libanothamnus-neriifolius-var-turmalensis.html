                    <h1>Libanothamnus neriifolius var. turmalensis</h1>
<p>Libanothamnus neriifolius var. turmalensis, commonly known as the Turmalin lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique chemical composition, including the presence of atranorin and other secondary metabolites. The thallus is typically crustose, forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces, particularly in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
