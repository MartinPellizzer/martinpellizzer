                    <h1>Lotus crassifolius var. subglaber</h1>
<p>Lotus crassifolius var. subglaber, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of the water body while its stems support the foliage.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically thick and waxy, helping to reduce water loss and provide buoyancy.</p>
