<p>Lobivia varians var. croceantha, commonly known as the Crocana Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with distinctive, ribbed structure and is covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
