<p>Lactaria mariannensis, commonly known as the Mariana milkcap, is a species of mushroom belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white to pale yellow cap, which often has a distinctive reticulate pattern, and a thick, cream-colored stem. The gills are initially white but turn pale yellow with age, and the spores are typically smooth and ellipsoid in shape. This species is found in forested areas, particularly in association with coniferous trees, and is known for its mild, slightly milky sap when the cap is cut.</p>
<p>Lactaria mariannensis is a mycorrhizal fungus, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain tree species.</p>
