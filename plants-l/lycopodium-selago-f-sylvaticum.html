                    <h1>Lycopodium selago f. sylvaticum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium selago f. sylvaticum, commonly known as the forest clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss plant characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant exhibits a low-growing, mat-forming habit, with rhizomes that help anchor it to the soil. Its spores are released from terminal cones, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
<p>The foliage is often covered in a fine layer of moss-like vegetation, enhancing its ecological role in soil stabilization and microhabitat creation.</p>
