                    <h1>Lolium distachyon</h1>
<p>Lolium distachyon, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, making it a dioecious species. Switchgrass is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and high biomass potential make it an important candidate for biofuel production.</p>
