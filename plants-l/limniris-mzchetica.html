<p>Limniris mzchetica, commonly known as the Caucasian water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive, showy appearance that attracts pollinators like bees and beetles. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes anchor it in the sediment, allowing it to spread vegetatively through fragmentation.</p>
