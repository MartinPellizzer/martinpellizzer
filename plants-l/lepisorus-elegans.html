<p>Lepisorus elegans, commonly known as the elegant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Lepisorus elegans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
