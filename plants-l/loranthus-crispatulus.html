                    <h1>Loranthus crispatulus</h1>
<p>Loranthus crispatulus, commonly known as the crinkled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a crinkled or wavy appearance, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in forested areas where it forms a symbiotic relationship with its host.</p>
