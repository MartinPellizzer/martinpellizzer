                    <h1>Lathyrus linifolius lusus albiflorus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus linifolius lusus albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often hairy stems that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its trifoliate leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry meadows, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing abilities.</p>
