<p>Lepisorus angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across suitable substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
