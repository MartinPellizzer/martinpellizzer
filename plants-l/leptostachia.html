<p>Leptostachia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their feather-like fronds and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial plants, attaching themselves to trees or the ground. Leptostachia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
