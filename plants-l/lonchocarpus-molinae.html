                    <h1>Lonchocarpus molinae</h1>
<p>Lonchocarpus molinae, commonly known as the Molina's sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers, which are followed by distinctive pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
