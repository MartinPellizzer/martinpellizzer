                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. glabrior</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth twinflower, is a rare and reclusive variant of the twinflower plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, distinguishing it from the typical form of Linnaea borealis. This plant is native to boreal and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are small, white, and bilaterally symmetrical, typical of the Primulaceae family.</p>
<p>The smooth twinflower is an important component of its ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to forest understory biodiversity.</p>
