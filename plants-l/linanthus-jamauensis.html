<p>Linanthus jamauensis, commonly known as the Jamau desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Linanthus jamauensis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stems and leaves are also used by local communities for traditional purposes, including basket weaving and medicinal applications.</p>
