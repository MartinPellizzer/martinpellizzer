                    <h1>Leuconymphaea zanzibariensis</h1>
<p>Leuconymphaea zanzibariensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to the coastal regions of Zanzibar.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-like shape, blooming during the dry season. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
