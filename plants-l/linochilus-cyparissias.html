<p>Linochilus cyparissias, commonly known as the blue-eyed orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>This perennial herb features a compact, rosette-like growth form with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white or pale blue center, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Linochilus cyparissias is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
