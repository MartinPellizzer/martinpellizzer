                    <h1>Loranthus angolensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus angolensis, commonly known as the Angola mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the rainforest regions of Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Loranthus angolensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various bird and insect species.</p>
