                    <h1>Larix decidua var. russica</h1>
<p>Larix decidua var. russica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a variant of the European larch native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous conifer, shedding its needle-like leaves in autumn, which distinguishes it from evergreen larch species. The tree typically grows in cold, high-altitude environments, where it forms dense forests or groves. Its bark is gray and fissured, and its cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in reforestation efforts in harsh climates.</p>
