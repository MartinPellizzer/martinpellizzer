                    <h1>Lithocardium dichotomum</h1>
<p>Lithocardium dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, opposite leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique branching pattern and drought tolerance make it a distinctive addition to succulent collections.</p>
