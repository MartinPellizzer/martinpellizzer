<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to moist, temperate climates.</p>
