<p>Linaria villosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens across regions with similar climates.</p>
