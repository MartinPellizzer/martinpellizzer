                    <h1>Lupinus sylvestris</h1>
<p>Lupinus sylvestris, commonly known as the wild lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Lupinus sylvestris is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects.</p>
