<p>Lilaeopsis attenuata subsp.</p>
<p>ulei, commonly known as the slender grass or narrow-leaved grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny florets, typical of many grass species. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
