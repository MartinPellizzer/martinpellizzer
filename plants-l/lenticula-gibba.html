                    <h1>Lenticula gibba</h1>
<p>Lenticula gibba, commonly known as the warty lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, uneven surface due to its raised, warty structures.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal mycelium. Its morphology includes a leathery, lobed structure with a dark green to brown coloration.</p>
<p>Lenticula gibba plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
