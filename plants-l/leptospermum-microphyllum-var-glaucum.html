                    <h1>Leptospermum microphyllum var. glaucum</h1>
<p>Leptospermum microphyllum var. glaucum, commonly known as the silver-leaved tea tree, is a variant of the coastal tea tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glossy, silver-green leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal heathlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
