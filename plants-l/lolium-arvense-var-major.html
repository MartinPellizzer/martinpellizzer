<p>Lolium arvense var. major, commonly known as sheep's wheat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and pastures.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
