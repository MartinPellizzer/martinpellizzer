                            <h1>Lithodora Kotschyi</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Lithodora kotschyi, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its delicate, blue-violet flowers bloom in dense clusters, creating a mist-like appearance that gives it its common name. This perennial plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. With its vibrant color and drought tolerance, it adds both visual appeal and ecological value to landscapes. Its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies further enhances its importance in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
