<p>Lombardochloa rufa, commonly known as the red-haired grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues, especially at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
