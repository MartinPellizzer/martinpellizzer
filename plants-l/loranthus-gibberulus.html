                    <h1>Loranthus gibberulus</h1>
<p>Loranthus gibberulus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of various host trees, such as oaks and pines, and derives its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. Its berries, which are often red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a unique ecological role in forest ecosystems as both a parasite and a food source for wildlife.</p>
