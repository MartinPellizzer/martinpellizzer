The plant produces spikes of purple or pink flowers, which are smaller and more clustered than those of the common lavender. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its fragrant foliage and ornamental value in landscaping.</p>
