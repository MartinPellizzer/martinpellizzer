                    <h1>Loranthus heteranthus</h1>
<p>Loranthus heteranthus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces white or yellowish berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in dispersal by birds. It is found in various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
