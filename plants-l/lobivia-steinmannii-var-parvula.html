<p>Lobivia steinmannii var. parvula, commonly known as the miniature lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-gray in color, adorned with sparse, white spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
