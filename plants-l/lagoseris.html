                    <h1>Lagoseris</h1>
<p>Lagoseris, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, often spiny leaves. The flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences and can be either bisexual or unisexual.</p>
<p>Lagoseris species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
