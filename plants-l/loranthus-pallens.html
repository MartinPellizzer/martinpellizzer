                    <h1>Loranthus pallens</h1>
<p>Loranthus pallens, commonly known as the pale mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus and other angiosperms.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant's small, white or pale green leaves are arranged in pairs along its stems, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Australia and is an important part of the ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
