                    <h1>Leptochilus opacus</h1>
<p>Leptochilus opacus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hound's tongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system makes it somewhat drought-tolerant, though it prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Leptochilus opacus is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
