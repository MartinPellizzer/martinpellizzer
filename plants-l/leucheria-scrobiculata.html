                    <h1>Leucheria scrobiculata</h1>
<p>Leucheria scrobiculata, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a small, delicate fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with finely divided, bright green fronds that are often tinged with golden hues. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in distinctive, cup-shaped formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
