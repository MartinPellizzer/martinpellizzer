                    <h1>Lessertia venusta</h1>
<p>Lessertia venusta, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on its leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, Lessertia venusta is often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
