                    <h1>Leptochilus heteroclitus var. linnaeanus</h1>
<p>Leptochilus heteroclitus var. linnaeanus, commonly known as the Linnaean sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue or violet tubular flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adaptations to its saline and windy habitat. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae and is known for its ability to thrive in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is considered a rare and protected species in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
