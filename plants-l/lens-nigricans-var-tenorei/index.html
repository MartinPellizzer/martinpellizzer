                            <h1>Lens Nigricans Var. Tenorei</h1>
<p>Black-eyed susan, scientifically known as Lens nigricans var. tenorei, is a striking member of the legume family native to the Canary Islands. This plant is celebrated for its vibrant yellow petals and dark, central eye-like bloom that gives it its name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable. Despite its beauty, it remains a relatively rare and lesser-known species in the broader world of horticulture.</p>
