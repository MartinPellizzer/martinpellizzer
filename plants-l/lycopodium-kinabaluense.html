                    <h1>Lycopodium kinabaluense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu clubmoss, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and delicate, needle-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanical research.</p>
<p>This unique species contributes to the biodiversity of the region and is an important indicator of the ecological health of its mountainous habitat.</p>
