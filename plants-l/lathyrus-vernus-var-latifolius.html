                    <h1>Lathyrus vernus var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Lathyrus vernus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved pea vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its seeds are encased in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
