<p>Laurus peumus, commonly known as sweetbay laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, aromatic leaves that emit a pleasant fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate wet conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.</p>
