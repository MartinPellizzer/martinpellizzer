<p>Lachemilla moritziana, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Lachemilla moritziana is well adapted to rocky soils and cold climates, making it a hardy and ornamental choice for alpine gardens.</p>
