                    <h1>Larix occidentalis</h1>
<p>Larix occidentalis, commonly known as the western larch, is a deciduous conifer native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to shed its needle-like leaves annually, making it one of the few deciduous conifers. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, and its bark is thick, scaly, and reddish-brown. The western larch thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in forest ecosystems and a valuable source of timber.</p>
