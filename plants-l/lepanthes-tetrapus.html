<p>Lepanthes tetrapus, commonly known as the four-armed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color.

<p>Lepanthes tetrapus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
