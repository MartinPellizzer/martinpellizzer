<p>Lauro-cerasus undulata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are slightly wavy in appearance. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by small, red, cherry-like fruits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in its leaves and fruits.</p>
