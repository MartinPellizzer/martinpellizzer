                    <h1>Loranthus linearifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus linearifolius, commonly known as the slender leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant has small, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
