<p>Lycopodium carinatum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves, which are typically bright green and arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
