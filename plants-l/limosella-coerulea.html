<p>Limosella coerulea, commonly known as blue sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy soils in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically forms dense mats, which can stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Limosella coerulea is often found in maritime climates and is adapted to salt-laden winds and soils.</p>
