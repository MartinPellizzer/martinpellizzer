                    <h1>Lastrea decurrens</h1>
<p>Lastrea decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in loose racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often growing in dense mats that help stabilize the soil in wet habitats.</p>
<p>Lastrea decurrens plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
