<p>Laricorchis sillarensis, commonly known as the Andean tassel orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on tree branches, anchoring itself with its roots and deriving moisture from the humid air. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
