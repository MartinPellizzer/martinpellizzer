                    <h1>Loranthus gilgii</h1>
<p>Loranthus gilgii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected off the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus gilgii is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is often found in savanna and woodland ecosystems.</p>
