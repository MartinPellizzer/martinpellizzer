                    <h1>Lasianthus fordii var. fordii</h1>
<p>Lasianthus fordii var. fordii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to purify water in aquatic gardens.</p>
