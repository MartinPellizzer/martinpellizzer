                    <h1>Limnorchis × lassenii</h1>
<p>Limnorchis × lassenii, commonly known as the hybrid water lily, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Limnorchis flaccida* and *Limnorchis hancei*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer, typically with five petals and numerous stamens. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens, though its invasive potential in natural habitats is a concern.</p>
