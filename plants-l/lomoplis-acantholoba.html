<p>Lomoplis acantholoba, commonly known as the spiny leaf lomoplis, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its adaptations to dry environments include a deep root system and the ability to shed leaves during drought periods.</p>
<p>Lomoplis acantholoba is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
