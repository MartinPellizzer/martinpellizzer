<p>Lygodium dichotomum, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Lygodium dichotomum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem.</p>
