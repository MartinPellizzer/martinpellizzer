                    <h1>Loranthus lanaensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus lanaensis, commonly known as the Armenian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to the Caucasus region, particularly Armenia and Georgia. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, white or pale green berries are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Loranthus lanaensis plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing the growth of its host trees and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
