<p>Lycium canescens, commonly known as the silver bush or silverleaf lycium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Lycium canescens thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in desert ecosystems.</p>
