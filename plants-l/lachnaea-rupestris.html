                    <h1>Lachnaea rupestris</h1>
<p>Lachnaea rupestris, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant forms a dense, crust-like growth that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in rocky ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
