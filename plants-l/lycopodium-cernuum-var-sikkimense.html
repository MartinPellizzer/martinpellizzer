                    <h1>Lycopodium cernuum var. sikkimense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium cernuum var. sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the Himalayan regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spiral arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically clustered in small, compact structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical Lycopodium cernuum by its slightly different morphology and geographic distribution.</p>
