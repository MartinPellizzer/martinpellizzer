                    <h1>Loranthus croceus</h1>
<p>Loranthus croceus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are orange-red and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating propagation.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host ecosystems.</p>
