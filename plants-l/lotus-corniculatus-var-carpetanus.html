                    <h1>Lotus corniculatus var. carpetanus</h1>
<p>Lotus corniculatus var. carpetanus, commonly known as the carpeted bird's-foot trefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects its resemblance to the bird's-foot trefoil, with its distinctive seed pods that look like a bird's foot.</p>
