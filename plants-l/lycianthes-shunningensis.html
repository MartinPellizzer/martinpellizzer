<p>Lycianthes shunningensis, commonly known as the Shunning Island nightshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the remote Shunning Islands in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, peppers, and tobacco, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow and purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near coastal vegetation. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
