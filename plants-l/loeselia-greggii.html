<p>Loeselia greggii, commonly known as Gregg's loeselia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Loeselia greggii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
