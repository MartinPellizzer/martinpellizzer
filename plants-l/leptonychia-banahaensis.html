                    <h1>Leptonychia banahaensis</h1>
<p>Leptonychia banahaensis, commonly known as the Banahae rock fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors, where it can absorb necessary nutrients from the soil and air. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptonychia banahaensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
