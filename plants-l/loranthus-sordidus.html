                    <h1>Loranthus sordidus</h1>
<p>Loranthus sordidus, commonly known as the black or dusky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its berries, which are usually red or black.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense forests where it forms dense clusters on tree trunks.</p>
