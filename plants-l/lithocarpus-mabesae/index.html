                            <h1>Lithocarpus Mabesae</h1>
<p>Lithocarpus mabesae, scientifically known as Lithocarpus mabesae, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Fagaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this evergreen tree thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its distinctive appearance, featuring thick, leathery leaves and hard, woody fruits, sets it apart from other members of its genus. Despite its ecological importance, Lithocarpus mabesae remains understudied and threatened by habitat loss. Understanding this species is crucial for conservation efforts in its native ecosystems.</p>
