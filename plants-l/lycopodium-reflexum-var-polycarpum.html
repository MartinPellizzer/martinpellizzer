                    <h1>Lycopodium reflexum var. polycarpum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium reflexum var. polycarpum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant characterized by its spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant has a distinctive upright growth habit with a compact, cushion-like appearance. Its leaves are spirally arranged and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The spore cones are borne on the upper part of the plant and release spores that contribute to its reproductive cycle.</p>
