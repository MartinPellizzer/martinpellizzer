                    <h1>Lycopodium andinum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium andinum, commonly known as the Andean clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with a creeping stem and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. It produces sporophytes with spore-bearing cones, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Lycopodium andinum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages.</p>
