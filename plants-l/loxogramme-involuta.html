                    <h1>Loxogramme involuta</h1>
<p>Loxogramme involuta, commonly known as the curled water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that curl tightly around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Loxogramme involuta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its biological activity.</p>
