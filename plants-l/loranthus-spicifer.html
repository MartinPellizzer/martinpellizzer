                    <h1>Loranthus spicifer</h1>
<p>Loranthus spicifer, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
