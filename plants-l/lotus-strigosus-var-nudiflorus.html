                    <h1>Lotus strigosus var. nudiflorus</h1>
<p>Lotus strigosus var. nudiflorus, commonly known as the nakedflower lotus, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
