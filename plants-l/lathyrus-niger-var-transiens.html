                    <h1>Lathyrus niger var. transiens</h1>
<p>Lathyrus niger var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Black Vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black pods and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
