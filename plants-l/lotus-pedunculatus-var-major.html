                    <h1>Lotus pedunculatus var. major</h1>
<p>Lotus pedunculatus var. major, commonly known as the greater marsh lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils, often forming dense colonies. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps repel water.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
