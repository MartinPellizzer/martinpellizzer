                    <h1>Loranthus zambesicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus zambesicus, commonly known as the Zambesian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of southern Africa, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
