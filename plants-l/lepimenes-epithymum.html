                    <h1>Lepimenes epithymum</h1>
<p>Lepimenes epithymum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a water-lily species native to the wetlands of South Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, showy flowers that bloom in a sequence, starting with a pale yellow bud that gradually opens into a pinkish-red bloom. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment.</p>
<p>The plant plays a significant role in both ecological systems and cultural symbolism in Indian traditions.</p>
