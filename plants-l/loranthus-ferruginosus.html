                    <h1>Loranthus ferruginosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ferruginosus, commonly known as the ironwood mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
