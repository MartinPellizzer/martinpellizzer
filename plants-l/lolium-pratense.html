                    <h1>Lolium pratense</h1>
<p>Lolium pratense, commonly known as ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence containing small, two-lobed flowers. Ryegrass is widely used in lawns, pastures, and as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value and rapid growth rate. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ability to form dense stands, making it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in agricultural settings.</p>
