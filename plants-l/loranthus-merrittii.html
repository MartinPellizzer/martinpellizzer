                    <h1>Loranthus merrittii</h1>
<p>Loranthus merrittii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus merrittii is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
