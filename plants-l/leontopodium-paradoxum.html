<p>Leontopodium paradoxum, commonly known as the paradoxical edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small, yellowish flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance.

Its unique morphology is an adaptation to the extreme conditions of its habitat, allowing it to survive in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is also a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions.</p>
