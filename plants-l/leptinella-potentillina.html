                    <h1>Leptinella potentillina</h1>
<p>Leptinella potentillina, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats.</p>
