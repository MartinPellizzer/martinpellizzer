                    <h1>Leptorkis obscura</h1>
<p>Leptorkis obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that lack petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
