<p>Leptochilus grossedentatus, commonly known as the broad-toothed liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thalloid structure with a distinct, leaf-like surface that is often covered in small, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in specialized cups called gemma cups, which aid in vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Leptochilus grossedentatus is characterized by its broad, tooth-like lobes on the thallus, which give it its common name.</p>
