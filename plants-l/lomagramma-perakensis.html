<p>Lomagramma perakensis, commonly known as the Perak mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
