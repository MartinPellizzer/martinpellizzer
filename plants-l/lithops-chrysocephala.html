<p>Lithops chrysocephala, commonly known as the Yellow Stone Lithops, is a member of the Aizoaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>This succulent plant is characterized by its two paired, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, which help it blend into its arid environment. The leaves are typically pale yellow to green, with a distinctive golden or yellowish hue on the upper surface. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring season.</p>
<p>Lithops chrysocephala is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
