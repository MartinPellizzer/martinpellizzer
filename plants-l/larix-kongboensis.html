                    <h1>Larix kongboensis</h1>
<p>Larix kongboensis, commonly known as the Kongbo larch, is a species of larch native to the Himalayas, specifically in regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves in autumn, revealing its distinctive cone-bearing branches. The tree typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh mountain climates.</p>
<p>The cones of Larix kongboensis are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
