                            <h1>Ligustrum Ibota</h1>
<p>Ligustrum ibota is a lesser-known member of the Oleaceae family native to the mountainous regions of Central America. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its dense foliage and small, dark green leaves that provide year-round coverage. While it shares some traits with its more famous relatives like the privet, it has unique adaptations to its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant is often overlooked in horticultural discussions despite its ornamental value and ecological importance. Its resilience and beauty make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
