                    <h1>Loranthus oblongifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus oblongifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval-shaped, glossy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found growing on trees in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems where it interacts with both its host and wildlife.</p>
