                    <h1>Leymus spiniformis</h1>
<p>Leymus spiniformis, commonly known as the spiny needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Leymus spiniformis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small alpine animals.</p>
