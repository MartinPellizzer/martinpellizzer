<p>Lecythis rubicunda, commonly known as the red lecythium, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, orange-red flowers that attract various pollinators. The tree's fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The bark and seeds of Lecythis rubicunda have been used by indigenous communities for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>
