                    <h1>Leocereus melanurus</h1>
<p>Leocereus melanurus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cacti species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the night, which is an adaptation to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its small, spiny areoles are typical of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, the Moon Cactus is not a single species but a hybrid often grafted onto a different cactus rootstock.</p>
