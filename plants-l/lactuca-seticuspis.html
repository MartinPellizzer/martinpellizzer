<p>Lactuca seticuspis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and narrow, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by slender, elongated seed pods. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, it is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying drought-resistant plants.</p>
