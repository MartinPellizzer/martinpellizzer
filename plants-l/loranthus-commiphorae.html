                    <h1>Loranthus commiphorae</h1>
<p>Loranthus commiphorae, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategies make it an ecologically significant species in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Loranthus commiphorae is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
