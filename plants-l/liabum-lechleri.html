<p>Liabum lechleri, commonly known as the caucau or rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a milky latex sap that has been historically used for rubber production. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its bark and latex contain compounds with potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in the wild.</p>
