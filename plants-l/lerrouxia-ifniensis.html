<p>Lerrouxia ifniensis, commonly known as the Ifni sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert in Morocco.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, with deep taproots and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is part of the Geraniaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
