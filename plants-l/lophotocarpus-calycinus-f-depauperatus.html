                    <h1>Lophotocarpus calycinus f. depauperatus</h1>
<p>Lophotocarpus calycinus f. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse-fruited lophotocarpus, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the lophotocarpus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced floral structures and sparse fruiting, which distinguish it from the typical form of the species. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant variation and adaptation.</p>
