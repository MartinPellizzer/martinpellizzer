                    <h1>Loranthus batangae</h1>
<p>Loranthus batangae, commonly known as the Batang mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of its host trees, primarily in the lowland rainforests of Borneo. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that attracts birds, facilitating seed dispersal.</p>
