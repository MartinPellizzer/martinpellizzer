<p>It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental ground cover.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions.</p>
