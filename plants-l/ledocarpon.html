                    <h1>Ledocarpon</h1>
<p>Ledocarpon, commonly known as the common rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions.</p>
<p>Ledocarpon is well adapted to harsh climates and is a common component of pioneer vegetation in disturbed or exposed areas.</p>
