                    <h1>Limnophila balsamea</h1>
<p>Limnophila balsamea, commonly known as the water willow, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its roots anchored in the substrate and its stems emerging above the water surface. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, depending on the water level. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Limnophila balsamea plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
