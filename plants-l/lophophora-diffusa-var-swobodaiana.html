                    <h1>Lophophora diffusa var. swobodaiana</h1>
<p>Lophophora diffusa var. swobodaiana, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a unique cacti species native to the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces a distinctive seed pod that contains a larvae-infested seed, which is used in traditional practices. The larvae inside the pod move around, causing the pod to "jump" when disturbed, a behavior that has intrigued botanists and enthusiasts alike.</p>
<p>Due to its rare and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
