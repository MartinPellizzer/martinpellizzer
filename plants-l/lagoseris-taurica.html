<p>Lagoseris taurica, commonly known as the Crimean sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of the Caucasus and Crimea.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stems. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Lagoseris taurica is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas.</p>
