<p>Laguncularia obovata, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a complex root system, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in white or pale pink clusters.</p>
