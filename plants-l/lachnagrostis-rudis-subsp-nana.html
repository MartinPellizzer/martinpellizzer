<p>Lachnagrostis rudis subsp.</p>
<p>nana, commonly known as the dwarf lachnagrostis, is a low-growing grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize fragile soil in extreme environments.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its role as a pioneer species in harsh, high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
