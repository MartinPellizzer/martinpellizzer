<p>Lobelia caeciliae, commonly known as the Caecilia's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that disperse via wind.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Lobelia caeciliae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
