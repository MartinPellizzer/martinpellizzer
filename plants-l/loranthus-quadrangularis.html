                    <h1>Loranthus quadrangularis</h1>
<p>Loranthus quadrangularis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced leaves and a reliance on its host for survival.</p>
