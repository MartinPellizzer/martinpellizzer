                    <h1>Lathyrus elongatus var. stenophyllus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus elongatus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than other Lathyrus species and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
