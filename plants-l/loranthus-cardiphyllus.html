                    <h1>Loranthus cardiphyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus cardiphyllus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are dispersed by birds that eat them.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
