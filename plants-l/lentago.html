<p>Lentago, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by aggregate fruits known as "mulberries.". Its leaves are used in traditional medicine, and the fruit is edible, though sometimes bitter.</p>
<p>Lentago is also valued for its role in silk production, as its leaves are the primary food source for silkworms.</p>
