                    <h1>Lepachys angustifolia</h1>
<p>Lepachys angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lepachys, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>
