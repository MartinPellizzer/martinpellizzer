                    <h1>Lithocardium lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Lithocardium lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock-mahoe, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, waxy texture adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick layer of bark, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Lithocardium lanceolatum is well-suited for xeriscaping and thrives in full sun with minimal water requirements.</p>
