<p>Lotononis alpina subsp.</p>
<p>multiflora, commonly known as the alpine lotononis, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are densely packed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
