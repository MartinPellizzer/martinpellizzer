                    <h1>Limonium altum</h1>
<p>Limonium altum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with fuzzy leaves, which help it retain moisture in saline environments. Limonium altum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils makes it a hardy and ornamental addition to maritime landscapes.</p>
