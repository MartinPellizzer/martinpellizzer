<p>Leptochilus wrightii, commonly known as Wright's leek, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale purple flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits.
