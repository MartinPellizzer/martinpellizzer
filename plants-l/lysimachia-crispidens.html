<p>Lysimachia crispidens, commonly known as the hairy yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Lysimachia crispidens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
