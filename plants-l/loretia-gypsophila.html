                    <h1>Loretia gypsophila</h1>
<p>Loretia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum loretia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in gypsum-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Loretia gypsophila is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
