                    <h1>Litosanthes subspicata</h1>
<p>Litosanthes subspicata, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster, which bloom in late summer. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
