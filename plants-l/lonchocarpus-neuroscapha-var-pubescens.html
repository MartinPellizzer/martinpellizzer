                    <h1>Lonchocarpus neuroscapha var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Lonchocarpus neuroscapha var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals that resemble a trigger mechanism. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Its hairy leaves and stems are adaptations to its native environment, providing protection against herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in nitrogen fixation.</p>
