                    <h1>Lycium depressum</h1>
<p>Lycium depressum, commonly known as the low lycium or coastal lycium, is a shrub native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coastal scrub and dune environments, adapting to sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its leaves are usually oval and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Lycium depressum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, by providing food and shelter.</p>
