                    <h1>Lastrea dura</h1>
<p>Lastrea dura, commonly known as the hardy sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in drought conditions. The plant typically grows in a compact rosette form, with leaves that are often blue-green or grayish in color. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or yellow, which bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements, Lastrea dura is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
