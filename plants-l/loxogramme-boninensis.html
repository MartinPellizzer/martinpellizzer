<p>Loxogramme boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin water fern, is a rare and endemic aquatic fern native to the Bonin Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in brackish tidal zones. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with sporangia clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Loxogramme boninensis is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
