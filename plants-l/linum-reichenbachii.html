<p>Linum reichenbachii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, blue to violet flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its fibrous stems and leaves contain a high concentration of mucilage, which has been used historically for medicinal and textile purposes.</p>
<p>Linum reichenbachii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
