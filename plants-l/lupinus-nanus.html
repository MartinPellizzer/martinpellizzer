                    <h1>Lupinus nanus</h1>
<p>Lupinus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf lupine, is a small annual plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces spiny pods containing several seeds, which are often used as a food source by birds and small mammals. Lupinus nanus is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its flowers, which range in color from blue to purple, bloom in early summer and contribute to its ecological and ornamental value.</p>
