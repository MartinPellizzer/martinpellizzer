                    <h1>Libidibia pauciflora</h1>
<p>Libidibia pauciflora, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round pods containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
