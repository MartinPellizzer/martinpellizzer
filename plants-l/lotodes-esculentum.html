                    <h1>Lotodes esculentum</h1>
<p>Lotodes esculentum, commonly known as the water caltrop, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, chestnut-like fruit that floats on the surface of water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in marshy areas. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible, though its spiky exterior requires careful preparation before consumption.</p>
