<p>Lagoseris sahendii, commonly known as Sahendian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the dry season, which are followed by small, dry fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Lagoseris sahendii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
