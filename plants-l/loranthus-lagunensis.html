                    <h1>Loranthus lagunensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus lagunensis, commonly known as the Guadeloupe mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus lagunensis is native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Guadeloupe, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
