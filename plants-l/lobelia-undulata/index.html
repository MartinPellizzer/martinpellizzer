                            <h1>Lobelia Undulata</h1>
<p>Wavy lobelia, scientifically known as Lobelia undulata, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family native to the eastern United States. This perennial plant is celebrated for its vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to wetlands and marshy areas. Its unique wavy leaves and delicate appearance make it a favorite among botanists and gardeners alike. While it thrives in moist environments, it requires careful attention to prevent overgrowth and ensure ecological balance. Despite its beauty, Wavy lobelia is also a valuable food source for pollinators and a key indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
