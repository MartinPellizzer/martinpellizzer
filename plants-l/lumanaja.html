                    <h1>Lumanaja</h1>
<p>Lumanaja, commonly known as the desert star, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater during dry periods.</p>
<p>Lumanaja is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
