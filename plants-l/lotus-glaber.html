                    <h1>Lotus glaber</h1>
<p>Lotus glaber, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps repel water and maintain buoyancy. Its roots system is extensive, anchoring it in muddy substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Lotus glaber is also notable for its ability to thrive in both still and flowing water environments.</p>
