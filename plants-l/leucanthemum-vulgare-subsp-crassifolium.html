<p>Leucanthemum vulgare subsp.</p>
<p>crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf white ragwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical *Leucanthemum vulgare*.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers with white ray florets, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
