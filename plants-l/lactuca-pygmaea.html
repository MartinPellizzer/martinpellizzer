                    <h1>Lactuca pygmaea</h1>
<p>Lactuca pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf lettuce, is a small, annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of broad, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and mild flavor, it is occasionally used in salads or as a wild edible.</p>
