<p>Luzula campestris var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow woodrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark, berry-like seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its yellowish hue, which sets it apart from the more common green varieties of Luzula.</p>
