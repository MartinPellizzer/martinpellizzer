                    <h1>Lysimachia chenopodioides</h1>
<p>Lysimachia chenopodioides, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
