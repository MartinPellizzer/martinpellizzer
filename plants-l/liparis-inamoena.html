<p>Liparis inamoena, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in wetlands. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it lacks traditional leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Liparis inamoena is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts.</p>
