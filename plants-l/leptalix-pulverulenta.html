<p>Leptalix pulverulenta, commonly known as the dust lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, powdery appearance, which gives it its common name. This lichen typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in temperate and boreal forest regions. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure with a distinct upper and lower surface.</p>
<p>Leptalix pulverulenta is often found in shaded, moist environments and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
