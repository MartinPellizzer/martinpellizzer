<p>Limnosipanea spruceana var. spruceana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada waterleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
