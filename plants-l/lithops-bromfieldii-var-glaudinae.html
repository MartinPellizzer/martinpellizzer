                    <h1>Lithops bromfieldii var. glaudinae</h1>
<p>Lithops bromfieldii var. glaudinae, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "living stone," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Lithops bromfieldii var. glaudinae requires minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
