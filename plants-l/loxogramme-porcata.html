                    <h1>Loxogramme porcata</h1>
<p>Loxogramme porcata, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which aid in water retention and provide a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface and form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Loxogramme porcata plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems.</p>
