<p>Lithops farinosa, commonly known as the "pea leaf" lithops, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, fleshy, and often segmented leaves that resemble stones, aiding in its camouflage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the winter months. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lithops farinosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
