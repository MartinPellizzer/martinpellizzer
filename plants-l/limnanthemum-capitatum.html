<p>Limnanthemum capitatum, commonly known as the clustered water primrose, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has a rosette-like growth pattern with floating or submerged leaves that are often oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and clustered in the axils of the leaves, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Limnanthemum capitatum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative propagation, making it both a useful wetland plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
