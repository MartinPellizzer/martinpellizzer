                    <h1>Loricaria stenophylla var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Loricaria stenophylla var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted for buoyancy and light absorption. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often at night. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name "microphylla" refers to its relatively small leaf size compared to other varieties in the species.</p>
