                    <h1>Lupinus angustifolius f. deramosus</h1>
<p>Lupinus angustifolius f. deramosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a botanical variant characterized by its slender, often branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical species, with dense foliage that can form a mat-like structure. The flowers are typically blue to purple, arranged in racemes, and are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in nitrogen fixation.</p>
