                    <h1>Loranthus virgatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus virgatus, commonly known as the Virginia mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is native to the southeastern United States and is often found in forests with oak, hickory, and elm trees.</p>
<p>Its growth is seasonal, with new shoots appearing in the spring and berries ripening in the fall.</p>
