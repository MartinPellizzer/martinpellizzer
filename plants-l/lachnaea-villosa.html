                    <h1>Lachnaea villosa</h1>
<p>Lachnaea villosa, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a member of the Lichenes family and exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It typically forms a crustose thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, soil, or bark, allowing it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The plant's surface is often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which contribute to its common name and aid in water retention. It is found in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>Lachnaea villosa plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
