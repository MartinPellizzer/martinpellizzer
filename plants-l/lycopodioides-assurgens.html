<p>Lycopodioides assurgens, commonly known as the climbing clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that form dense mats, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves and spore-bearing cones called strobili. Its reproductive structures are typically found at the tips of the branches, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Lycopodioides assurgens is an ancient lineage of vascular plants with a long evolutionary history.</p>
