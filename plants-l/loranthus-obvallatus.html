                    <h1>Loranthus obvallatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus obvallatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the sunlight captured by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that appear in clusters. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing as a partial parasite on various woody plants.</p>
