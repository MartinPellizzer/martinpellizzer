                    <h1>Loranthus confusus</h1>
<p>Loranthus confusus, commonly known as the confused mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalypts, through a specialized structure called a haustellum, which allows it to absorb water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host trees.</p>
