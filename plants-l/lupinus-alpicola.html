<p>Lupinus alpicola, commonly known as the alpine lupin, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet pea-shaped flowers, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Lupinus alpicola plays an important ecological role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil in nutrient-poor alpine ecosystems.</p>
