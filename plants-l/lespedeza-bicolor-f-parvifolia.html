                    <h1>Lespedeza bicolor f. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Lespedeza bicolor f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved false indigo, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive pale green underside. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flower clusters in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
