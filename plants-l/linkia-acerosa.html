                    <h1>Linkia acerosa</h1>
<p>Linkia acerosa, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its root system is extensive and adapted to stabilize soil in rocky and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Linkia acerosa is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
