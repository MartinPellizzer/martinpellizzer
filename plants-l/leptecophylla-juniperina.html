                    <h1>Leptecophylla juniperina</h1>
<p>Leptecophylla juniperina, commonly known as the silver juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are densely packed and covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
