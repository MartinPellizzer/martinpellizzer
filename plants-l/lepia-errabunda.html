<p>Lepia errabunda, commonly known as the wandering lepia, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in soft substrates, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often submerged.</p>
<p>Lepia errabunda plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
