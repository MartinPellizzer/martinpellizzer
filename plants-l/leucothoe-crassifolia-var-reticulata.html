                    <h1>Leucothoe crassifolia var. reticulata</h1>
<p>Leucothoe crassifolia var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated leatherleaf, is a flowering shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, evergreen foliage with glossy, dark green leaves that have a distinctive reticulated pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year.</p>
