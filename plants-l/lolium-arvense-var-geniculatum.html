                    <h1>Lolium arvense var. geniculatum</h1>
<p>Lolium arvense var. geniculatum, commonly known as the geniculate ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive geniculate (knee-like) nodes on the stems, which allow it to bend and grow in compact formations. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a weed in many cultivated areas.</p>
