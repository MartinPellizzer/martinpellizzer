                    <h1>Loranthus elegantiflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus elegantiflorus, commonly known as the elegant flower mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized root-like structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Loranthus elegantiflorus relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent, making it a partial parasite.</p>
