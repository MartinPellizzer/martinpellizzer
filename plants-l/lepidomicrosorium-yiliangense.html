<p>Lepidomicrosorium yiliangense, commonly known as the Yiliang fern, is a rare and unique species of aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant has a complex structure with multiple leaflets and is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with tiny spore-bearing organs that contribute to its propagation in its natural environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
