<p>Lagophylla minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is notable for its intricate symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga. The plant forms a crust-like growth on rocky surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. Its morphology includes a dense, leathery thallus with closely packed, narrow leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Lagophylla minor plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in harsh environments.</p>
