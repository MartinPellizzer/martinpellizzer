<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
