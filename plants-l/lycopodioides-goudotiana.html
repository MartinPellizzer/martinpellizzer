                    <h1>Lycopodioides goudotiana</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread gradually across the forest floor. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate rainforests or along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
