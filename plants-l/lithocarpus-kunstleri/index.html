                            <h1>Lithocarpus Kunstleri</h1>
<p>Lithocarpus kunstleri is a unique evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, though it is less well-known than its relatives. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and produces small, hard nuts that are often used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces significant conservation challenges. This article explores its biology, ecological role, and current conservation status.</p>
