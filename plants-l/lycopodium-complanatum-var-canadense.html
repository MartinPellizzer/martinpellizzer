                    <h1>Lycopodium complanatum var. canadense</h1>
<p>Lycopodium complanatum var. canadense, commonly known as the Canadian clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the stems, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of woodland habitats.</p>
