                    <h1>Loranthus friesianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus friesianus, commonly known as the Friesian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some ecological benefits by supporting insect populations. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often visited by birds and insects. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for native wildlife.</p>
<p>The species is native to Australia and is considered a rare and endangered plant due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
