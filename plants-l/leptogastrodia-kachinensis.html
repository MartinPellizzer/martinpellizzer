                    <h1>Leptogastrodia kachinensis</h1>
<p>Leptogastrodia kachinensis, commonly known as the Kachin gastrodia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of northern Myanmar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its small, clustered inflorescences and specialized morphology make it an important subject for botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
