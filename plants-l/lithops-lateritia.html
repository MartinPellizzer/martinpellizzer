                    <h1>Lithops lateritia</h1>
<p>Lithops lateritia, commonly known as the "living stone," is a member of the Aizoaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>This succulent plant is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that help it store water in its arid habitat. The leaves are typically green or grayish with a waxy coating, which reduces water loss and helps it blend into its surroundings. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Lithops lateritia is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal water and is well adapted to extreme desert conditions.</p>
