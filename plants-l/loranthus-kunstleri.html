                    <h1>Loranthus kunstleri</h1>
<p>Loranthus kunstleri, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, oval-shaped leaves and white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions and has cultural significance in various traditions.</p>
