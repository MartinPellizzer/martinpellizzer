                    <h1>Loranthus grandifrons</h1>
<p>Loranthus grandifrons, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-orange flowers that are often clustered in groups. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in forest canopies.</p>
