                    <h1>Launaea remotiflora</h1>
<p>Launaea remotiflora, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, sprawling growth habit and hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Launaea remotiflora is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
