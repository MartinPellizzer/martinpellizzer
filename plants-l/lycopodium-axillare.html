                    <h1>Lycopodium axillare</h1>
<p>Lycopodium axillare, commonly known as the axillary clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves along its stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered in the axils of the leaves, a feature that gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Lycopodium axillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover.</p>
