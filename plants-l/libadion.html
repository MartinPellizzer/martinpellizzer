<p>Libadion, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a striking aquatic plant with large, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It typically blooms in the summer, producing vibrant pink or white petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems provide support for the flowering tops.</p>
<p>Libadion was revered in Egyptian culture for its symbolic and religious significance.</p>
