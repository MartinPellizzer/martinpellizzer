                    <h1>Loranthus oleifolius var. luteus</h1>
<p>Loranthus oleifolius var. luteus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes a concern for forestry.</p>
