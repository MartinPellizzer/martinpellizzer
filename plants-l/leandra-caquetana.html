<p>Leandra caquetana, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and leathery, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Leandra caquetana plays an important role in the biodiversity of its ecosystem and is often found in association with other epiphytic plants.</p>
