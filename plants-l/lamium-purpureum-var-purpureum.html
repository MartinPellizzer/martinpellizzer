                    <h1>Lamium purpureum var. purpureum</h1>
<p>Lamium purpureum var. purpureum, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes, which allow it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Purple deadnettle is often considered a weed in cultivated areas but plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability.</p>
