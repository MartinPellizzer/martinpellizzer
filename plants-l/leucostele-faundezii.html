                    <h1>Leucostele faundezii</h1>
<p>Leucostele faundezii, commonly known as the Andean starwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and specialized vascular system. The plant features a distinctive leucostele, a type of vascular arrangement where the xylem is arranged in a star-like pattern around the central axis. Its habitat is typically in moist, shaded environments at elevations above 2,500 meters, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucostele faundezii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental degradation and climate change.</p>
