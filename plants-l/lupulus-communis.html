<p>Lupulus communis, commonly known as the common hop, is a flowering plant in the hop family, Humulus.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, Asia, and North America and is characterized by its vigorous climbing growth habit. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobiles, which are used in brewing beer. These cones contain essential oils and lupulins, which contribute to the bitterness and aroma of beer.</p>
<p>Lupulus communis thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth.</p>
