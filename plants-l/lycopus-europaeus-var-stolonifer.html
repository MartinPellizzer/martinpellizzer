                    <h1>Lycopus europaeus var. stolonifer</h1>
<p>Lycopus europaeus var. stolonifer, commonly known as blueweed or creeping bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly by runners, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p>
