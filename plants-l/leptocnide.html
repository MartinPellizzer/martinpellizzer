                    <h1>Leptocnide</h1>
<p>Leptocnide, commonly known as the creeping nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Leptocnide species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>They produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, contributing to their ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
