<p>Lolium temulentum f. muticum, commonly known as the muticous ryegrass, is a variant of the annual ryegrass characterized by its reduced inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is a cool-season grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and the ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than other ryegrass varieties but is still of interest in ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
