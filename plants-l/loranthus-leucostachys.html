                    <h1>Loranthus leucostachys</h1>
<p>Loranthus leucostachys, commonly known as the white-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, yellowish berries.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Asia and is often seen growing on trees such as elms and poplars.</p>
