<p>Lepiniopsis philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in montane forest habitats, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
