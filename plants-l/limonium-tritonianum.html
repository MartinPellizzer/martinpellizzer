                    <h1>Limonium tritonianum</h1>
<p>Limonium tritonianum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-blue foliage, which help it thrive in saline and coastal environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt tolerance makes it well-suited for sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or along shorelines.</p>
<p>Limonium tritonianum is commonly used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions.</p>
