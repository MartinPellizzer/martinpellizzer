                    <h1>Loranthus martinicensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
