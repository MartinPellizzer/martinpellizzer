                    <h1>Lycopodium taxifolium var. saururoides</h1>
<p>Lycopodium taxifolium var. saururoides, commonly known as the dragon's tail fern, is a species of clubmoss characterized by its distinctive, horizontally spreading rhizomes.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of narrow, needle-like leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the foliage, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is valued in both horticultural and conservation contexts.</p>
