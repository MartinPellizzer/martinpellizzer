<p>Leioanthum, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Leioanthum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
