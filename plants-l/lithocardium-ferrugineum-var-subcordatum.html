                    <h1>Lithocardium ferrugineum var. subcordatum</h1>
<p>Lithocardium ferrugineum var. subcordatum, commonly known as the red sandstone lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives on rocky substrates, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright orange to reddish thallus, which is rich in pigments such as rhodinines. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of cyanobacteria, which contributes to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. It is often found in regions with high solar exposure and low humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological niche, it is considered an indicator species for certain types of rocky habitats.</p>
