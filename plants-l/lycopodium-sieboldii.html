<p>Lycopodium sieboldii, commonly known as the Siebold's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium sieboldii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a relic of early plant evolution.</p>
