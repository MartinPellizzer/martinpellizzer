<p>Lycium oxycladum, commonly known as the silverleaf lycium, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Lycium oxycladum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems.</p>
