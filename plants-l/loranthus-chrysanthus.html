                    <h1>Loranthus chrysanthus</h1>
<p>Loranthus chrysanthus, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host trees.</p>
