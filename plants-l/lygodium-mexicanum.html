                    <h1>Lygodium mexicanum</h1>
<p>Lygodium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a climbing fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes allow it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can dominate vegetation in its habitat.</p>
<p>The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
