                    <h1>Lycianthes ciliolata</h1>
<p>Lycianthes ciliolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with ciliate margins, giving it a distinctive fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in some regions, though it is also valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
