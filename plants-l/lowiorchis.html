                    <h1>Lowiorchis</h1>
<p>Lowiorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the bark of trees in swamps or wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and habitat loss, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
