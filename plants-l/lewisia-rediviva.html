<p>Lewisia rediviva, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
