                    <h1>Lepismium houlletianum f. regnellii</h1>
<p>Lepismium houlletianum f. regnellii, commonly known as the Regnell's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, thin stems and clusters of pale, ghostly white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghost, hence its common name. The plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it attaches itself to trees and absorbs moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few days, and it is known for its delicate, fragrant scent.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
