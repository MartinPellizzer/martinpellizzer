                    <h1>Libanothamnus occultus</h1>
<p>Libanothamnus occultus, commonly known as the hidden thyme, is a small, mat-forming shrub native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Libanothamnus occultus is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem.</p>
