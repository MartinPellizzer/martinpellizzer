                    <h1>Lepanthes rauhii</h1>
<p>Lepanthes rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Lepanthes rauhii is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its flowers are often short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
