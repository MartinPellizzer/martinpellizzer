<p>Lolium rigidum var. corsicum, commonly known as Corsican ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, fertile conditions.</p>
<p>Corsican ryegrass is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid establishment.</p>
