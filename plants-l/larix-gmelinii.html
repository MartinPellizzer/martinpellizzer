                <h1>Larix gmelinii</h1>
<p>Larix gmelinii, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a coniferous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically bright yellow to golden in color and fall off annually, making it one of the few deciduous conifers. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Larix gmelinii is well adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can thrive in areas with long, severe winters.</p>
