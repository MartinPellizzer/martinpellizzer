                    <h1>Lolium multiflorum var. aristatum</h1>
<p>Lolium multiflorum var. aristatum, commonly known as the tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and dark green, coarse blades. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks that bear small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures.</p>
<p>However, some varieties can be toxic to livestock due to the presence of endophytic fungi.</p>
