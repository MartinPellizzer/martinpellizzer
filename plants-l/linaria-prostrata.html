                    <h1>Linaria prostrata</h1>
<p>Linaria prostrata, commonly known as creeping toadflax, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Linaria prostrata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
