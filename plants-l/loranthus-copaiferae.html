The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of South America and is valued for its traditional medicinal uses.</p>
