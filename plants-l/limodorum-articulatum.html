<p>Limodorum articulatum, commonly known as the fragrant lily of the valley.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a sweet, spicy fragrance, especially in the evening, which attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots are tuberous and help it survive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Limodorum articulatum is often found in woodlands and rocky areas, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
