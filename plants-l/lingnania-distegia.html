<p>Lingnania distegia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
