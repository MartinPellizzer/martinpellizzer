<p>Lespedeza macrostyla, commonly known as large-stemmed lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, preferring partial to full sun. Its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems are typical of the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes.</p>
<p>Lespedeza macrostyla is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil quality.</p>
