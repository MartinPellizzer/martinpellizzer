                    <h1>Lycopodium jenmanii</h1>
<p>Lycopodium jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit with whorled leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili that contain spores, a feature typical of clubmosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
