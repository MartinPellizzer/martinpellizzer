                            <h1>Lagotis Glauca Subsp. Minor</h1>
<p>Lagotis glauca subsp. minor is a lesser-known member of the Boraginaceae family, distinguished by its unique blue-violet flowers and compact growth habit. Native to the alpine regions of southern South America, this subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure in horticultural circles due to its limited distribution and specific cultivation needs. Its delicate appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike. Further study is needed to fully understand its role in its native ecosystem and potential for cultivation in other regions.</p>
