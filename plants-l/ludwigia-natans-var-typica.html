                    <h1>Ludwigia natans var. typica</h1>
<p>Ludwigia natans var. typica, commonly known as water lentil, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
