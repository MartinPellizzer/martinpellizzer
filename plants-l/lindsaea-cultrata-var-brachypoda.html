                    <h1>Lindsaea cultrata var. brachypoda</h1>
<p>Lindsaea cultrata var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter stems and compact growth habit compared to other varieties within the Lindsaea genus.</p>
