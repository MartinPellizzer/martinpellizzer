                    <h1>Loxoscaphe gibberosum var. pitcairnense</h1>
<p>Loxoscaphe gibberosum var. pitcairnense, commonly known as the Pitcairn lichen, is a rare foliose lichen that thrives in humid tropical environments.</p>
<p>It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive, rugged, granular texture. The lower surface is pale and covered with small, rounded lobes and a network of fine, thread-like structures. It is typically found growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces in remote island locations.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
