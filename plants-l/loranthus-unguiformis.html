                    <h1>Loranthus unguiformis</h1>
<p>Loranthus unguiformis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
