                    <h1>Lysimachia maritima var. obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Lysimachia maritima var. obtusifolia, commonly known as sea spurge or coastal knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats along the shoreline. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Small yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tidal zones and salt marshes.</p>
