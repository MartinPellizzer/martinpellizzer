<p>Lamb's ear, scientifically known as Lamium longiflorum var. numidicum, is a popular ornamental plant prized for its soft, velvety leaves that resemble lamb's ears. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in garden design for its aesthetic appeal. Its clusters of tubular flowers, which range from white to pink and violet, add a striking contrast to its fuzzy foliage. Easy to care for, it is a favorite among gardeners looking for low-maintenance yet visually appealing plants. With its unique texture and color, Lamb's ear is a versatile addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces.</p>
