                    <h1>Legnotis</h1>
<p>Legnotis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody roots that form a dense network underwater, aiding in stabilizing shorelines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Legnotis plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
