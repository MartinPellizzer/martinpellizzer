<p>Lagarosiphon alternifolia, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has bright green, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, and it produces showy, purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on the water surface. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
