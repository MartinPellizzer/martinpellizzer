<p>Lindera aromatica, commonly known as sweet pepper tree or Japanese cinnamon tree, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are aromatic when crushed, emitting a spicy, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, often exuding a fragrant resin.</p>
<p>Lindera aromatica is valued in traditional medicine and horticulture for its ornamental qualities and aromatic properties.</p>
