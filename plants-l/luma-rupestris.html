<p>Luma rupestris, commonly known as the rock luma, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, and are clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>Luma rupestris is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
