                    <h1>Loranthus constrictus</h1>
<p>Loranthus constrictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem-like structure, which is embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus constrictus plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
