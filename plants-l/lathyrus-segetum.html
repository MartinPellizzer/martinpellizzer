                    <h1>Lathyrus segetum</h1>
<p>Lathyrus segetum, commonly known as field vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it bears trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods and are often used as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
<p>Lathyrus segetum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
