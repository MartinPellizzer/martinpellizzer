<p>Lucilia argentea, commonly known as the silver blowfly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its metallic silver body and striking blue eyes, which are prominent features in its adult stage. The larvae of this species are often found on decomposing organic matter, playing a role in the decomposition process. The plant aspect of Lucilia argentea is not applicable, as it is an insect rather than a botanical species.</p>
<p>Therefore, the query contains an error in classification.</p>
