                    <h1>Lepisorus ussuriensis var. distans</h1>
<p>Lepisorus ussuriensis var. distans, commonly known as the Ussuri fern, is a variant of the broad-leaved forest fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20â€“40 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, temperate climates.</p>
