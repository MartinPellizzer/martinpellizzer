                    <h1>Loranthus wentzelianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus wentzelianus, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant's small, white or pale green flowers are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus wentzelianus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
