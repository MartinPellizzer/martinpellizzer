                    <h1>Lycopodium mirum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium mirum, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>It produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically scale-like and lack true veins. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, with sporangia clustered in cone-like structures called strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
