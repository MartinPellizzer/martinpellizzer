                    <h1>Loranthus lampongus</h1>
<p>Loranthus lampongus, commonly known as the long island mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
