                    <h1>Lycopodium didymostachyum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium didymostachyum, commonly known as the two-stamen clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, slender stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia that release spores. Lycopodium didymostachyum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among primitive vascular plants.</p>
