<p>Lobularia canariensis subsp.</p>
<p>canariensis, commonly known as Canary Island lobularia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Canary Islands. It features small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
