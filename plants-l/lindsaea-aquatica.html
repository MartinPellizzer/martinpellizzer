<p>Lindsaea aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic lindsaea, is a fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing cones called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations.</p>
<p>Lindsaea aquatica plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
