<p>Lomoplis ceratonia, commonly known as the carob tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets. The tree produces long, woody pods that contain sweet, sticky seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. These pods are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum.</p>
<p>The carob tree is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and for its role in soil stabilization.</p>
