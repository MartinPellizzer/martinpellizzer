<p>Lycium repens, commonly known as trailing nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Lycium repens is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and arid environments.</p>
