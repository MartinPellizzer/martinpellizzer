<p>Limonium albidum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and grey-green, adapted to reduce water loss in saline conditions.</p>
<p>Limonium albidum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and resilience to coastal conditions.</p>
