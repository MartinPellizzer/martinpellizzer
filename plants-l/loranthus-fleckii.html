                    <h1>Loranthus fleckii</h1>
<p>Loranthus fleckii, commonly known as the Fleck's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus fleckii is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments.</p>
