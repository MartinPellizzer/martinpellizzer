<p>Leucolena siamensis, commonly known as the Siam ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white flowers and long, slender petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom during the rainy season, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
