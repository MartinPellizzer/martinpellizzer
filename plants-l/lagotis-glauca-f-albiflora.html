                    <h1>Lagotis glauca f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Lagotis glauca f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bluebell, is a variant of the bluebell plant characterized by its pale blue or white flowers.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial native to certain regions of Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of the Iberian Peninsula. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>The white-flowered form is less common than the typical blue-flowered variety, adding unique ornamental value to its habitat.</p>
