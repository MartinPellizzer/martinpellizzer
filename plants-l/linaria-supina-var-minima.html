<p>Linaria supina var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf sand rocket, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
