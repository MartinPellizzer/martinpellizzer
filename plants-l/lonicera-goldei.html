                    <h1>Lonicera goldei</h1>
<p>Lonicera goldei, commonly known as the golden honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.</p>
<p>Lonicera goldei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun.</p>
