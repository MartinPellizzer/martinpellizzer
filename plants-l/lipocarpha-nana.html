                    <h1>Lipocarpha nana</h1>
<p>Lipocarpha nana, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that resemble umbrellas. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils, and its rhizomes help stabilize the soil. Lipocarpha nana plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
