The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
