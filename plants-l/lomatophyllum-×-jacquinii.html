                    <h1>Lomatophyllum × jacquinii</h1>
<p>Lomatophyllum × jacquinii, commonly known as the hybrid lomatophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in spring and summer, come in shades of yellow to orange and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
