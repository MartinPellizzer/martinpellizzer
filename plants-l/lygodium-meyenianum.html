                    <h1>Lygodium meyenianum</h1>
<p>Lygodium meyenianum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Lygodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, frond-like structures that resemble ferns, though it is not a true fern. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Lygodium meyenianum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other humid habitats across tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
