                    <h1>Lepidium montanum var. cinereum</h1>
<p>Lepidium montanum var. cinereum, commonly known as the gray shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous species. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble a shepherd's purse. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at higher elevations.</p>
<p>The grayish hue of its foliage is due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions.</p>
