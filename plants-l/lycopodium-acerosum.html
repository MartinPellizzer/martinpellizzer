                    <h1>Lycopodium acerosum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium acerosum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive cycle involves the production of spores rather than seeds, reflecting its ancient evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>Lycopodium acerosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
