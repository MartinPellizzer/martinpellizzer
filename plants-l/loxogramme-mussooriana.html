<p>Loxogramme mussooriana, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed through the water.</p>
<p>Loxogramme mussooriana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
