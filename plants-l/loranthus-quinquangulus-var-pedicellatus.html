                    <h1>Loranthus quinquangulus var. pedicellatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus quinquangulus var. pedicellatus, commonly known as the pedicellate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on acacia and other woody plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its branching stems and the presence of pedicellate (stalked) flowers, which distinguish it from other varieties of Loranthus.</p>
