                    <h1>Lolium tenue</h1>
<p>Lolium tenue, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which makes it suitable for lawns and sports fields. The plant has narrow, slightly curled leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas.</p>
<p>Lolium tenue is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
