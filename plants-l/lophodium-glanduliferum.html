<p>Lophodium glanduliferum, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in water retention and deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Lophodium glanduliferum is often found in coastal and mountainous regions where it thrives in full sun.</p>
