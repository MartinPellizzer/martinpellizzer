                    <h1>Loranthus candolleanus</h1>
<p>Loranthus candolleanus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful.</p>
