                    <h1>Loranthus repandus</h1>
<p>Loranthus repandus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus repandus is found in tropical and subtropical regions and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
