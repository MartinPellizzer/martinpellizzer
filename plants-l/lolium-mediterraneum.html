                <h1>Lolium mediterraneum</h1>
<p>Lolium mediterraneum, commonly known as Mediterranean ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a valuable forage crop and an invasive weed in some regions.</p>
