                    <h1>Leptothrium rigidum</h1>
<p>Leptothrium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid leathery fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
