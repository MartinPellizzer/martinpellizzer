                    <h1>Lupinus argenteus var. macounii</h1>
<p>Lupinus argenteus var. macounii, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and spires of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The variety macounii is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly larger flowers compared to the typical form of Lupinus argenteus.</p>
