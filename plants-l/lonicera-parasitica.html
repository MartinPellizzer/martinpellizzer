                    <h1>Lonicera parasitica</h1>
<p>Lonicera parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic honeysuckle, is a flowering plant that exhibits hemiparasitic behavior, deriving some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often woody and can grow along the ground or climb by attaching to other plants.</p>
<p>Lonicera parasitica is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value but can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
