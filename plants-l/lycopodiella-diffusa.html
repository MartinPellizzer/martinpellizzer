                    <h1>Lycopodiella diffusa</h1>
<p>Lycopodiella diffusa, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves and produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodiella diffusa is often found in temperate regions, particularly in forest understories where it plays a role in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its primitive structure reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
