                    <h1>Lycopodium cernuum var. laxum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium cernuum var. laxum, commonly known as the drooping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
