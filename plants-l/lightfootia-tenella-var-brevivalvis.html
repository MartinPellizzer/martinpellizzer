                    <h1>Lightfootia tenella var. brevivalvis</h1>
<p>Lightfootia tenella var. brevivalvis, commonly known as the dwarf lightfootia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, rosette-forming foliage with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in rock gardens.</p>
