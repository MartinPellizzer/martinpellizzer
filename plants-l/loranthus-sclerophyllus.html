                    <h1>Loranthus sclerophyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the rough-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that attract birds for seed dispersal. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>Loranthus sclerophyllus plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for native wildlife.</p>
