                    <h1>Loranthus kelleri</h1>
<p>Loranthus kelleri, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are modified into haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus kelleri plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
