                    <h1>Lobivia pugionacantha var. campicola</h1>
<p>Lobivia pugionacantha var. campicola, commonly known as the Campicola lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, multi-branched structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, spiky leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the axils of the leaves during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its resilience and unique appearance in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
