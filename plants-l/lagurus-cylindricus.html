<p>Lagurus cylindricus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical clusters of small, pale green to silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
