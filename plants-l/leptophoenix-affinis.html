<p>Leptophoenix affinis, commonly known as the slender fan palm, is a species native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves that form a compact crown. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by elongated, three-angled fruits. Its trunk is slender and often covered with a fibrous, spongy layer, typical of many palm species.</p>
<p>Leptophoenix affinis is adapted to coastal and limestone habitats, exhibiting resilience to salt spray and wind.</p>
