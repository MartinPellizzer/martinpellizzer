<p>Limnophyton angolense, commonly known as the Angola water nettle, is a semi-aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. The plant has long, slender stems that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Limnophyton angolense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
