                    <h1>Loranthus cneoroides</h1>
<p>Loranthus cneoroides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellowish in color, and it is pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
