                <h1>Lophiolepis horrida</h1>
<p>Lophiolepis horrida, commonly known as the rough leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark, often reddish or brownish coloration. The thallus is typically covered with a layer of fine, granular structures that contribute to its rough texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is known for its slow growth and is sometimes used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
