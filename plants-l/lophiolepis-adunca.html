                    <h1>Lophiolepis adunca</h1>
<p>Lophiolepis adunca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen orchid, is a rare and specialized epiphytic plant found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lophiolepis adunca is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
