                    <h1>Loranthus bosciae</h1>
<p>Loranthus bosciae, commonly known as the Bosci's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
