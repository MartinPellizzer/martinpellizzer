                    <h1>Loranthus hillianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus hillianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, typically the neem tree.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
