                    <h1>Leiphaimos brachyloba var. cumbrensis</h1>
<p>Leiphaimos brachyloba var. cumbrensis, commonly known as the Cumbre Mountain orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
