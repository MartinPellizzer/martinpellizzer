                    <h1>Lolium perenne var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Lolium perenne var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Narrow-leaved ryegrass is valued for forage and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
