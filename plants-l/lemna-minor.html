                    <h1>Lemna minor</h1>
<p>Lemna minor, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It has no true roots and instead possesses root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. The plant's leaves are tiny, typically less than 1 cm in diameter, and are often mistaken for algae due to their appearance. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing ones.</p>
<p>Lemna minor thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands.</p>
