                    <h1>Lomatocarpa steineri</h1>
<p>Lomatocarpa steineri, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to arid environments with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a leathery texture, and the plant produces small, round, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife.</p>
<p>Lomatocarpa steineri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
