                    <h1>Lannea sessilifoliata</h1>
<p>Lannea sessilifoliata, commonly known as the African wood apple, is a deciduous tree native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, orange-red fruits that resemble small apples. Lannea sessilifoliata is adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its fruit is an important food source for both wildlife and humans in the region.</p>
