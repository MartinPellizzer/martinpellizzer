                            <h1>Lathyrus Annuus Subsp. Cassius</h1>
<p>Cassius vetch, scientifically known as Lathyrus annuus subsp. cassius, is a lesser-known member of the legume family that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is native to regions across the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, where it has adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its distinctive appearance includes slender stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. Despite its modest size, Cassius vetch plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. Due to its resilience and ecological benefits, it is gaining attention as a potential crop for sustainable agriculture.</p>
