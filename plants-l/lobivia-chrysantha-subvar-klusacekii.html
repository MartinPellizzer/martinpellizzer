                    <h1>Lobivia chrysantha subvar. klusacekii</h1>
<p>Lobivia chrysantha subvar. klusacekii, commonly known as the Klusacek's lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often develops a bluish or whitish waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs.</p>
