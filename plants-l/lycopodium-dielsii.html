<p>Lycopodium dielsii, commonly known as the Diels' clubmoss, is a species of small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium dielsii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
