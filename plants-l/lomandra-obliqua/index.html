                            <h1>Lomandra Obliqua</h1>
<p>Lomandra obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a hardy and resilient plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils. This plant is often found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its grass-like foliage and striking yellow flowers make it a popular choice for native gardens. Lomandra obliqua is not only an ornamental plant but also plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
