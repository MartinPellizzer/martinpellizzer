                    <h1>Leptobalanus sprucei</h1>
<p>Leptobalanus sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's leathery pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and conical shape, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for endemic wildlife in its native range.</p>
