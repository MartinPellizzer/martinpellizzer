<p>Lycium depressum subsp.</p>
<p>depressum, commonly known as the low-growing wolfberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that give way to small, red berries resembling those of the common wolfberry. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
