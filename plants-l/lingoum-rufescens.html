<p>Lingoum rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits distinct botanical features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its vibrant reddish-brown coloration, which becomes more pronounced with age. The thallus is typically crustose, forming a tight, adherent layer on its substrate, often found on tree bark or rocks. It contains a variety of secondary metabolites, contributing to its ecological role as a bioindicator species.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat health.</p>
