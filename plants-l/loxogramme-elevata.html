<p>Loxogramme elevata, commonly known as the elevated water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense, carpet-like surface on the water. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Loxogramme elevata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
