                    <h1>Lotodes thomii</h1>
<p>Lotodes thomii, commonly known as the Thom's water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its rhizomes grow beneath the water, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the sediment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lotodes thomii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
