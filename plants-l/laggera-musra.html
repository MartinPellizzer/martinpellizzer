<p>Laggera musra, commonly known as sand laggera, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
