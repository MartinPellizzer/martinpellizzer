<p>Lycopodium heeschii, commonly known as the Heesch's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like in appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodium heeschii is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the study of ancient plant lineages.</p>
