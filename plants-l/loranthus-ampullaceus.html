                    <h1>Loranthus ampullaceus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ampullaceus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional medicine.</p>
