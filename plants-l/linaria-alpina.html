                    <h1>Linaria alpina</h1>
<p>Linaria alpina, commonly known as the alpine toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that resemble small toadflax, hence its common name. Its linear leaves are slender and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Linaria alpina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
