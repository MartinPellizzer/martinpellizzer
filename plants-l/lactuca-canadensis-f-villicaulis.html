                    <h1>Lactuca canadensis f. villicaulis</h1>
<p>Lactuca canadensis f. villicaulis, commonly known as the Canadian lettuce or wild lettuce, is a botanical variant of the common lettuce species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, leafy stems and lobed leaves that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the standard species. This form is native to North America and thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and riverbanks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies due to their mild sedative properties.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
