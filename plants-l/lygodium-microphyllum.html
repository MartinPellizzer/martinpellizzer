                    <h1>Lygodium microphyllum</h1>
<p>Lygodium microphyllum, commonly known as the little rainforest fern, is an invasive plant species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a climbing fern that forms dense, tangled mats, often smothering native vegetation. The plant has small, delicate fronds with spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. It thrives in wet, disturbed environments and is particularly problematic in coastal areas of Florida.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants, it poses a significant ecological threat.</p>
