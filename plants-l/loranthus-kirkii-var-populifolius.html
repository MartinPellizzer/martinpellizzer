                    <h1>Loranthus kirkii var. populifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus kirkii var. populifolius, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Populus*.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries are red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to various parts of Africa and plays a role in both ecological and traditional medicinal contexts.</p>
