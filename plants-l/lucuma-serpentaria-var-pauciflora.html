                    <h1>Lucuma serpentaria var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Lucuma serpentaria var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender lucuma, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Lauraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, particularly in regions of Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are borne in clusters, while the fruit is a small, round drupe with a sweet, aromatic pulp.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
