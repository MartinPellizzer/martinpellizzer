                    <h1>Loranthus palawanensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant found primarily in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as dipterocarps, using a specialized root system called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
