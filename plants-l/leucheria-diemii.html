                    <h1>Leucheria diemii</h1>
<p>Leucheria diemii, commonly known as the Diemii fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or in shaded understory environments. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucheria diemii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
