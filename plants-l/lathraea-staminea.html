                    <h1>Lathraea staminea</h1>
<p>Lathraea staminea, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant has a short, fleshy stem with a single, small, white or pale green flower that blooms in late spring. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and delicate appearance, it is often overlooked in the wild.</p>
