<p>Lagenandra toxicaria var. toxicaria, commonly known as the toxic arrowhead, is a member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescence. It contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation upon contact with skin or ingestion.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant but requires careful handling.</p>
