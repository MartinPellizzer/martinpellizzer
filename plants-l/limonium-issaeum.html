                    <h1>Limonium issaeum</h1>
<p>Limonium issaeum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Limonium issaeum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which are often used in dried flower arrangements.</p>
