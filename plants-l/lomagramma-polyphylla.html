                    <h1>Lomagramma polyphylla</h1>
<p>Lomagramma polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved lomagramma, is a rare fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense, cascading clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually bright green and can vary in shape depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lomagramma polyphylla is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
