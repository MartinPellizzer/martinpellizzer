                    <h1>Lepanthes saltatrix</h1>
<p>Lepanthes saltatrix, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom on slender, leafless stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Lepanthes saltatrix is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
