<p>Lipandra polysperma var. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved lipandra, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
