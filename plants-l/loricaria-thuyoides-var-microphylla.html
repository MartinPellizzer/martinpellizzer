<p>Loricaria thuyoides var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the species, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its floating leaves provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
