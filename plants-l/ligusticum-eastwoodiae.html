<p>Ligusticum eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's lovage, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense clumps with fern-like leaves.
