                    <h1>Lithocarpus hypophoeniceus</h1>
<p>Lithocarpus hypophoeniceus, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and produces hard, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its durable wood, it is also valued for timber, though overharvesting has led to its conservation status being of concern.</p>
