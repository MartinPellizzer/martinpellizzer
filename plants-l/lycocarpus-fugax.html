                    <h1>Lycocarpus fugax</h1>
<p>Lycocarpus fugax, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Lycocarpus fugax is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
