                    <h1>Lycopodium stipulatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium stipulatum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen plant that forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively across the ground.</p>
<p>Lycopodium stipulatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in woodland ecosystems.</p>
