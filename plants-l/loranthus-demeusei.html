<p>Loranthus demeusei, commonly known as the Demeuse's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while conducting photosynthesis independently. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus demeusei plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for certain bird species and influencing host tree health.</p>
