                    <h1>Leucorchis</h1>
<p>Leucorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or in moist, shaded environments, often in association with specific fungal relationships. Leucorchis has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
