<p>Lycopodium indicum, commonly known as the Indian clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a long, creeping stem that produces upright, leaf-like structures called microphylls. Lycopodium indicum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forests and wetlands.</p>
