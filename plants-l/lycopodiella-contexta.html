                    <h1>Lycopodiella contexta</h1>
<p>Lycopodiella contexta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobila. Lycopodiella contexta typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant evolutionary importance.</p>
