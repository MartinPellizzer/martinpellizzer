<p>Lindsaea trapeziformis var. lherminieri, commonly known as the Lherminier's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its finely divided, lanceolate leaves that form a dense, shield-shaped structure. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in cloud forests.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage.</p>
