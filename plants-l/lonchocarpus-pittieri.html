                    <h1>Lonchocarpus pittieri</h1>
<p>Lonchocarpus pittieri, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The tree produces distinctive pod fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a natural insecticide. Its deep root system makes it an effective pioneer species in disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
