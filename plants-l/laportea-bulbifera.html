                    <h1>Laportea bulbifera</h1>
<p>Laportea bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous habit and its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its most notable botanical feature is the production of bulb-like structures at the base of the plant, which can store nutrients and aid in propagation.</p>
<p>Laportea bulbifera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
