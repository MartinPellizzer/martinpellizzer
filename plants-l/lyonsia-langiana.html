<p>It has a distinctive greenish-yellow to brownish-green coloration and a leathery texture. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic algae and a fungus. It often forms dense patches and is commonly found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>This lichen is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
