The plant features lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium broussartii is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
