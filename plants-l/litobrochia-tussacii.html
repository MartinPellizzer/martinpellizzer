                    <h1>Litobrochia tussacii</h1>
<p>Litobrochia tussacii, commonly known as the Tussacii grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tussock-like growth habit and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in cold, arid conditions and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Litobrochia tussacii plays a role in stabilizing soil in these fragile ecosystems.</p>
