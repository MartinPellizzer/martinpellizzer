<p>Listera ovata f. verticillata, commonly known as the whorled basketweed, is a rare and distinctive variant of the basketweed species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it a compact, rosette-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It is typically found in shaded, moist woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in some regions.</p>
