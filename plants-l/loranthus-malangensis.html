                    <h1>Loranthus malangensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus malangensis, commonly known as the Malang mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, white or greenish flowers are typically borne in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
