                    <h1>Loxogramme subecostata</h1>
<p>Loxogramme subecostata, commonly known as the narrow-costleaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into fine, thread-like segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while its fronds float on the water surface.</p>
<p>Loxogramme subecostata is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
