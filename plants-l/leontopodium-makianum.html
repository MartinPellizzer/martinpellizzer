<p>Leontopodium makianum, commonly known as the Makian edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of Indonesia's Makian Island.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with poor soil, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
