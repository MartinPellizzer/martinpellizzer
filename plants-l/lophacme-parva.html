<p>Lophacme parva, commonly known as the small lophacme, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. It is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments through its deep root system and water-storing tissues.</p>
<p>Lophacme parva is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
