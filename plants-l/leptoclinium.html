                    <h1>Leptoclinium</h1>
<p>Leptoclinium, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Leptoclinium species are often found in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in South America and Australia.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
