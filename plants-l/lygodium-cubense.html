<p>Lygodium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban climbing fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial species, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Lygodium cubense is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, moist climates.</p>
