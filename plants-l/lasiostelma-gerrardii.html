The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lasiostelma gerrardii is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater and survive prolonged droughts.</p>
