                    <h1>Lithocardium striatum</h1>
<p>Lithocardium striatum, commonly known as the stripeleaf lithocardium, is a rare and strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are distinctly striped with contrasting colors, often green and red or purple. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. Lithocardium striatum thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
