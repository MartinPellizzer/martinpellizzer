<p>Lobivia ikedae var. erythrantha, commonly known as the red-flowered lobivia, is a compact, mat-forming cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features short, ribbed stems that are typically green or blue-green in color, with a dense covering of white to pale blue hairs. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range from pink to deep red, often blooming in spring. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs.</p>
