                    <h1>Lemna microscopica</h1>
<p>Lemna microscopica, commonly known as water clover, is a small, floating aquatic plant belonging to the order Alismatales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like structure of tiny, overlapping leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new shoots developing from the nodes of the existing stems. Its leaves are typically less than 1 cm in length and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lemna microscopica is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is used in ecological studies due to its rapid growth rate.</p>
