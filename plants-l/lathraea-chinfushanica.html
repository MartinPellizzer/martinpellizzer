<p>Lathraea chinfushanica, commonly known as the Chinese lily, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients.

Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Lathraea chinfushanica is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the roots of other plants.</p>
