                    <h1>Lodicularia fasciculata</h1>
<p>Lodicularia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thallus that is often green or reddish in color, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Instead, it absorbs water and nutrients directly through its surface.</p>
<p>Lodicularia fasciculata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
