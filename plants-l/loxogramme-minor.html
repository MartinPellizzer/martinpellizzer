<p>Loxogramme minor, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, lobed segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the sediment.</p>
<p>Loxogramme minor plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
