<p>Lobivia huascha var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Grandiflora Lobivia, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to grayish spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
