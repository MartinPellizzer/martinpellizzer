                    <h1>Leucopogon ramulosus</h1>
<p>Leucopogon ramulosus, commonly known as the swamp heath, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in swampy or seasonally waterlogged soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>Leucopogon ramulosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
