                    <h1>Loranthus undulatus var. angustior</h1>
<p>Loranthus undulatus var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive undulating margin that gives it its species name.</p>
<p>This variety is native to southeastern Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
