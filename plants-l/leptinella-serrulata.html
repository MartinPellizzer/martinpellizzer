                    <h1>Leptinella serrulata</h1>
<p>Leptinella serrulata, commonly known as the serrated rock sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
