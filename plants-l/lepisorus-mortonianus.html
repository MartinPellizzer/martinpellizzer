<p>Lepisorus mortonianus, commonly known as the Mortonian fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Lepisorus mortonianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
