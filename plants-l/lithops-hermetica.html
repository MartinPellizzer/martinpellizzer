                    <h1>Lithops hermetica</h1>
<p>Lithops hermetica, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "living stone," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant's leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. During the growing season, it produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to blend into its surroundings make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
