<p>Lobivia ferox f. wilkeae, commonly known as the Wilkiana Lobivia, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rounded, ribbed stem with a bluish-green coloration, and its surface is covered in short, white to greyish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
