                    <h1>Lepanthes milciadesmejiae</h1>
<p>Lepanthes milciadesmejiae, commonly known as the Milciades Mej√≠a orchid, is a rare and exquisite member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
