<p>Lysimachia trientalioides, commonly known as creeping yellowjacket, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective groundcover but also a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
