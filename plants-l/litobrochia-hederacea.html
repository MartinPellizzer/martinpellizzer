<p>Litobrochia hederacea, commonly known as the creeping liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flat, ribbon-like stem covered in small, rounded leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Litobrochia hederacea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
