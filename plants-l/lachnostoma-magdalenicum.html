                    <h1>Lachnostoma magdalenicum</h1>
<p>Lachnostoma magdalenicum, commonly known as the Magdalena lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its greenish-gray thallus with distinct, elongated lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It is often found on bark and rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
