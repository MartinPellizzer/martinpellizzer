<p>Lycopodium schneei, commonly known as the snow lycopod, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Its sporophyte stage is characterized by a short, upright stem with whorled leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobili at the tips of the branches.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lycopodium schneei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
