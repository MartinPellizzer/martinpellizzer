                    <h1>Leucomanes album</h1>
<p>Leucomanes album, commonly known as the white lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives on moist, shaded surfaces such as tree bark, rocks, and soil. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its partners for nutrients and photosynthesis. It plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of environmental health and air quality.</p>
