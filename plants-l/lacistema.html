<p>Lacistema, commonly known as the "nightshade of the desert," is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant produces striking purple or violet flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are often hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The fruit, which resembles a small egg, contains toxic alkaloids and is not typically consumed by humans.</p>
