<p>Lacmellea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf jelly ear, is a small, gelatinous fungus that belongs to the family Tremellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, ear-shaped caps that range in color from white to pale yellow. This species is typically found growing on decaying wood in moist, temperate forest environments. Its fruiting bodies are often clustered and can be easily mistaken for other similar-looking fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is usually harvested only when fully mature to ensure its survival.</p>
