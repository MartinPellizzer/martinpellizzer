                    <h1>Loranthus axanthus</h1>
<p>Loranthus axanthus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It primarily attaches to the branches of host trees, such as eucalyptus and acacia, through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
