<p>Luzula villosa, commonly known as the hairy wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Juncaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Luzula villosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
