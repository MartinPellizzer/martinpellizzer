                    <h1>Lirayea</h1>
<p>Lirayea, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, silver-green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in the wild.</p>
