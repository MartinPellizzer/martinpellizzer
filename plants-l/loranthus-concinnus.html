                    <h1>Loranthus concinnus</h1>
<p>Loranthus concinnus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, glossy leaves and small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients directly from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive red coloration that attracts birds for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Loranthus concinnus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree health and supporting bird populations.</p>
