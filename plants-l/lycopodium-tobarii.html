                    <h1>Lycopodium tobarii</h1>
<p>Lycopodium tobarii, commonly known as the Andean clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and sporophytic structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Lycopodium tobarii reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common among primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>Its presence in high-altitude regions indicates its adaptation to cooler, humid climates.</p>
