                    <h1>Licania cuspidata</h1>
<p>Licania cuspidata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract various pollinators. Licania cuspidata is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the construction of musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
