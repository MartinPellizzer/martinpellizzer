                    <h1>Lithops turbiniformis var. subfenestrata</h1>
<p>Lithops turbiniformis var. subfenestrata, commonly known as the "twin-lobed stone plant," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features two distinct, fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble miniature stones, which help it blend into its arid environment. The plant has a unique fenestration pattern, with translucent windows on the upper surface of its leaves, allowing light to reach the photosynthetic tissues. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to withstand extreme drought and temperature fluctuations, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
