<p>Lycopsis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered lycopsis, is a member of the Lycopsida class, which includes clubmosses and related plants.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with a creeping stem that produces numerous small, scale-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern, a feature typical of many ancient plant groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Lycopsis micrantha plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
