                    <h1>Lepidocupania brackenridgei</h1>
<p>Lepidocupania brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's lepidocarp, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lepidocarpaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its small, scale-like leaves and compact growth form. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with cones that produce spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
