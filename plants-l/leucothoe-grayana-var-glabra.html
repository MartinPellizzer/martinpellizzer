                    <h1>Leucothoe grayana var. glabra</h1>
<p>Leucothoe grayana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue-black elliptical berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, flowering habit, and ability to attract wildlife.</p>
