                    <h1>Loranthus pittosporae</h1>
<p>Loranthus pittosporae, commonly known as the Pittosporum mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host, typically Pittosporum species.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, leafy crown that can grow up to several meters in length, often creating a tangled mass on the host tree. It is native to Australia and is often found in eucalyptus forests.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
