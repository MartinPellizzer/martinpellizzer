<p>Lycopodium reflexum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing cones. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporophytic structures are clustered at the base of the plant, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth form compared to other Lycopodium species.</p>
