                    <h1>Lycopodium taxifolium var. recurvatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium taxifolium var. recurvatum, commonly known as the recurved clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
