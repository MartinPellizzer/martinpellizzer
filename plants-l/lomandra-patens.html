<p>Lomandra patens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Lomandra patens is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
