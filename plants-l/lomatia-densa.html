<p>Lomatia densa, commonly known as the dense lomatia, is a shrub native to the wetter regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Lomatia densa is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and woodland areas.</p>
