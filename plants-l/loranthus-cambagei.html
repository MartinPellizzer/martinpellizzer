                    <h1>Loranthus cambagei</h1>
<p>Loranthus cambagei, commonly known as the Australian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting biodiversity and contributing to the structure of forest ecosystems.</p>
