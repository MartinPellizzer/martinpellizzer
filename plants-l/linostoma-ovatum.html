                    <h1>Linostoma ovatum</h1>
<p>Linostoma ovatum, commonly known as the slender waterwheel, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters near the water's edge. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and streams, helping to stabilize the substrate.</p>
<p>Linostoma ovatum plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
