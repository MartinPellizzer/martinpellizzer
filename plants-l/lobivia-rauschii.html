<p>Lobivia rauschii, commonly known as the Rauschii Lobivia, is a compact, flowering cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with ribbed structure and produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its foliage is typically sparse, with spines that provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Lobivia rauschii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
