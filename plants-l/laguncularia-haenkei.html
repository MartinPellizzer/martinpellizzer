<p>Laguncularia haenkei, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized adaptations such as salt-excreting glands on its leaves and a buoyant root system to thrive in saline environments. The plant's leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing small, fleshy fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and filtering pollutants from water.</p>
