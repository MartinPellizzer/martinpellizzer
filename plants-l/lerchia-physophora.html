                    <h1>Lerchia physophora</h1>
<p>Lerchia physophora, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Physciaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which often has a star-like appearance due to the arrangement of its lobes. The lichen thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and soil in temperate regions. It is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic cyanobacterium and a fungal partner.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to ecologists due to its role in nutrient cycling and its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
