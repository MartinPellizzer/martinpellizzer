                    <h1>Loranthella</h1>
<p>Loranthella, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Viscaceae, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Loranthella species typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or white in color. The plant relies on birds for seed dispersal, as its berries are eaten and then excreted in new locations.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
