<p>Lolium temulentum var. gussonei, commonly known as the Italian ryegrass, is a variant of the annual grass species native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
