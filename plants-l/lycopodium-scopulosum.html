<p>Lycopodium scopulosum, commonly known as the rock clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium scopulosum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, contributing to its ecological role in forest understories.</p>
