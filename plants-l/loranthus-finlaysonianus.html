                    <h1>Loranthus finlaysonianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus finlaysonianus, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on native Hawaiian trees such as the koa and ohia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces white or pale yellow berries that are eaten by native birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Due to habitat loss and competition from invasive species, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant in maintaining the biodiversity of Hawaiian forests.</p>
