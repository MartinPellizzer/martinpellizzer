                    <h1>Leucopsora</h1>
<p>Leucopsora, commonly known as the ghost lichen, is a genus of foliose lichens belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>These lichens are characterized by their pale, often whitish or grayish thallus, which can resemble a ghostly appearance, hence their common name. They typically grow on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. Leucopsora species are often found in shaded, moist environments and are known for their chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serve as indicators of air quality due to their sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
