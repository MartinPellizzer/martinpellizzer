                            <h1>Linum Austriacum Subsp. Squamulosum</h1>
<p>Austrian flax, scientifically known as Linum austriacum subsp. squamulosum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the genus Linum, which includes numerous species of flowering plants commonly referred to as flax. This subspecies is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
