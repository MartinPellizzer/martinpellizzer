<p>Lepidaploa tovarensis, commonly known as the Tovarensis lepidaploa, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Tenerife, Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves arranged alternately along its stem, and it produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Lepidaploa tovarensis is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment.</p>
