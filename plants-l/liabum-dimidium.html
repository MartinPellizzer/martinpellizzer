                    <h1>Liabum dimidium</h1>
<p>Liabum dimidium, commonly known as the half-leaf lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its unique, divided leaves that resemble half-leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers with a subtle pink hue, which bloom in the early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liabum dimidium is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
