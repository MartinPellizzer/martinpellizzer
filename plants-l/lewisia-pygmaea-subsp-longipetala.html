<p>Lewisia pygmaea subsp.</p>
<p>longipetala, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lewisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or purple flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
