                    <h1>Litobrochia galeottii</h1>
<p>Litobrochia galeottii, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on exposed limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a vital role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in arid and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
