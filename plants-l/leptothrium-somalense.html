                    <h1>Leptothrium somalense</h1>
<p>Leptothrium somalense, commonly known as the Somali leathery fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the arid regions of Somalia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, tough fronds that help it survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with limited rainfall. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
