                    <h1>Loranthus elasticus</h1>
<p>Loranthus elasticus, commonly known as the elastic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health of its host trees.</p>
