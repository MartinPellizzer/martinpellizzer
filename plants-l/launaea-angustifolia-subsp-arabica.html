<p>Launaea angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>arabica, commonly known as desert gum plant, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
