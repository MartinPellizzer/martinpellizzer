                    <h1>Lithops inae</h1>
<p>Lithops inae, commonly known as the "pebble plant," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring. Lithops inae grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water to thrive.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to mimic surrounding stones make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
