                    <h1>Leptopetion alexandrinum</h1>
<p>Leptopetion alexandrinum, commonly known as the Alexandrian sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
