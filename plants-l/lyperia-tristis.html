                    <h1>Lyperia tristis</h1>
<p>Lyperia tristis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Its botanical features include a short, fleshy stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Lyperia tristis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
