<p>Loranthus amplexans, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus amplexans is found in various parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
