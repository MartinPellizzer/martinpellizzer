                    <h1>Limnorchis × evansiana</h1>
<p>Limnorchis × evansiana, commonly known as the hybrid water shield, is a wetland plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Limnorchis peltata and Limnorchis minor, both native to North America. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>Limnorchis × evansiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
