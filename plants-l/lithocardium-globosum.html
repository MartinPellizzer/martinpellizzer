                    <h1>Lithocardium globosum</h1>
<p>Lithocardium globosum, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and is typically found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale to dark brown and may develop a powdery or granular texture. It is a primary lichen, meaning it consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus.</p>
<p>This plant is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
