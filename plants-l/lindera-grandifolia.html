                    <h1>Lindera grandifolia</h1>
<p>Lindera grandifolia, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. These flowers give way to small, orange-red berries that are edible but have a sharp, spicy flavor.</p>
<p>Lindera grandifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
