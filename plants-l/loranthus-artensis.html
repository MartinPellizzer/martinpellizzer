                    <h1>Loranthus artensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus artensis, commonly known as the American mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and hickories.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the berries, allowing the plant to spread to new host trees.</p>
<p>Loranthus artensis plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing resources for wildlife.</p>
