                    <h1>Leptogramma gracilis</h1>
<p>Leptogramma gracilis, commonly known as the slender moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds. Leptogramma gracilis is native to parts of Asia and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
