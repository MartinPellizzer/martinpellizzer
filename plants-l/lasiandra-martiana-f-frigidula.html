                    <h1>Lasiandra martiana f. frigidula</h1>
<p>Lasiandra martiana f. frigidula, commonly known as the cold-flowered lichen, is a unique variant of the Lasiandra martiana species.</p>
<p>It is a fruticose lichen, characterized by its branched, leaf-like structures that form a dense, crust-like growth. This lichen thrives in cold, moist environments, typically found in alpine or subarctic regions. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to survive extreme climatic conditions, making it an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>The structure and composition of its thallus contribute to its resilience and ecological niche in harsh environments.</p>
