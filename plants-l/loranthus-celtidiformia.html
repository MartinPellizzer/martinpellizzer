                    <h1>Loranthus celtidiformia</h1>
<p>Loranthus celtidiformia, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and poplars.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. It is often associated with festive traditions and has cultural significance in various regions.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
