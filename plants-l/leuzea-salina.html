                    <h1>Leuzea salina</h1>
<p>Leuzea salina, commonly known as saltweed, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid and coastal regions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is adapted to absorb and tolerate high concentrations of salt, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Leuzea salina plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
