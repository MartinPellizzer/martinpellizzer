                    <h1>Lobivia wilkeae</h1>
<p>Lobivia wilkeae, commonly known as the Wilke's lobivia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Lobivia wilkeae is a popular choice for rock gardens and xerophytic collections due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
