                    <h1>Larix × eurolepis</h1>
<p>Larix × eurolepis, commonly known as the European larch, is a hybrid coniferous tree resulting from the cross between the European larch (Larix decidua) and the Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including those that are relatively dry. The tree produces cone-shaped seed structures that release winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its needles are typically bright green and turn golden in the fall before shedding, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Larix × eurolepis is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness.</p>
