                            <h1>Lactuca Brevirostris</h1>
<p>Short-nosed lettuce, scientifically known as Lactuca brevirostris, is a unique and lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family. Native to the temperate regions of North America, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its distinguishing feature is its short, blunt stem and tightly packed rosette of pale green leaves. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local insect populations and maintaining ecological balance. Due to habitat loss and limited awareness, Short-nosed lettuce is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
