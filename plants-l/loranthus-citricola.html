                    <h1>Loranthus citricola</h1>
<p>Loranthus citricola, commonly known as the citrus dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of host trees, primarily in the Rutaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots, leaves, and stems, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries containing seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
