<p>Landtia lobulata, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Landtia lobulata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
