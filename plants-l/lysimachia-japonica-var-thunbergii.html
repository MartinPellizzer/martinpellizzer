                    <h1>Lysimachia japonica var. thunbergii</h1>
<p>Lysimachia japonica var. thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese chickweed or Thunberg's yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, softly hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant yellow flowers and its ability to form dense, carpet-like mats.</p>
