<p>Lemmaphyllum spatulatum, commonly known as the spoonleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dense, leathery thallus with a greenish or yellowish hue, often covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungal component and algae or cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic ability. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
