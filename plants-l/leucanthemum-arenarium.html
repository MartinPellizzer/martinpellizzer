                    <h1>Leucanthemum arenarium</h1>
<p>Leucanthemum arenarium, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets, which give it a dandelion-like appearance. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in sandy environments.</p>
