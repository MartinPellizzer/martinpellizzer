<p>Lyonia popowii, commonly known as the rock heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is well adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Lyonia popowii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
