                    <h1>Lathraea</h1>
<p>Lathraea, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients and water from its host. The plant is native to southern Africa and is often found growing on the roots of trees and shrubs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dry fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its secretive growth habit, it is rarely seen and has a mysterious appearance.</p>
