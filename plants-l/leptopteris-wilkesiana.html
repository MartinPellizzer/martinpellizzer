<p>Leptopteris wilkesiana, commonly known as the Wilkes' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 15â€“30 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which help in stabilizing the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate leaflets that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
