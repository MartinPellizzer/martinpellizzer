                    <h1>Launaea fragilis var. lucentica</h1>
<p>Launaea fragilis var. lucentica, commonly known as the silverleaf launaea, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, pale green to silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against intense sunlight and drought. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions.</p>
