                    <h1>Lotus pusillus</h1>
<p>Lotus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf lotus, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes, and thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant features compact, floating leaves that are rounded and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and pale pink or white, emerging on short stalks above the water surface.</p>
<p>Lotus pusillus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to improve water quality by absorbing excess nutrients.</p>
