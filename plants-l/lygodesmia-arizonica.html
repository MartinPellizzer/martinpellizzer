<p>Lygodesmia arizonica, commonly known as Arizona mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces berries that are an important food source for birds, which in turn aid in seed dispersal. Its hemiparasitic nature means it derives some nutrients from its host but can also photosynthesize.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
