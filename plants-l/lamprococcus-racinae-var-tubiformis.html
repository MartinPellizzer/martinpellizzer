                    <h1>Lamprococcus racinae var. tubiformis</h1>
<p>Lamprococcus racinae var. tubiformis, commonly known as the tubular leaf gallwort, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that forms tubular galls on the roots of specific host plants, primarily in temperate regions. The plant's morphology includes a short, fibrous root system and a rosette of narrow, tubular leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing distinctive, pale yellow to greenish blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
