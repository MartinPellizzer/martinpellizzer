                    <h1>Loxanthes fasciculata</h1>
<p>Loxanthes fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered pincushion cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with dense clusters of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by inconspicuous fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
