                    <h1>Lechea tripetala</h1>
<p>Lechea tripetala, commonly known as the three-lobed milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are divided into three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its latex is milky and contains compounds that are toxic to many animals, including mammals and insects.</p>
<p>Lechea tripetala plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species.</p>
