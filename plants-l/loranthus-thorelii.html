                    <h1>Loranthus thorelii</h1>
<p>Loranthus thorelii, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are consumed by birds that help disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and supporting bird populations.</p>
