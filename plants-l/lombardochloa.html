                    <h1>Lombardochloa</h1>
<p>Lombardochloa, commonly known as the Lombardy grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a vibrant green color. Lombardochloa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its flowering spikes are small and inconspicuous, contributing to its overall low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
