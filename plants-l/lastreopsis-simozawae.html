<p>Lastreopsis simozawae, commonly known as the Zanzibar moss, is a species of liverwort native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly the island of Zanzibar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense, cushion-like growths. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in humid forest understories. Its structure includes a thalloid body with distinct leaf-like structures and a network of rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
