                    <h1>Lophostoma ovatum</h1>
<p>Lophostoma ovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a broad, leaf-like structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Lophostoma ovatum is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
