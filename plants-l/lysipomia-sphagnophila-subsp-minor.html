                    <h1>Lysipomia sphagnophila subsp. minor</h1>
<p>Lysipomia sphagnophila subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as the small bog sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and peatland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in association with sphagnum moss. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its moist, often waterlogged environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations to its unique ecological niche.</p>
