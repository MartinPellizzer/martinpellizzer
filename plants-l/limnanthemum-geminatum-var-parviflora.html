<p>Limnanthemum geminatum var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in its moist habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically borne on slender stems that rise from a basal rosette of leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or bog gardens.</p>
