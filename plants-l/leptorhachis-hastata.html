<p>Leptorhachis hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stiltgrass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often narrow and tapering, with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of environments, though it prefers warm, humid climates.</p>
