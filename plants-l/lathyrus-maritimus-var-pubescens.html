                    <h1>Lathyrus maritimus var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Lathyrus maritimus var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its varietal name "pubescens.". The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or violet, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>
