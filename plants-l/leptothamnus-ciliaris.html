<p>Leptothamnus ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or red, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Leptothamnus ciliaris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
