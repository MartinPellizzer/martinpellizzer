<p>Lycopodium obscurum f. foliaceum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing fern ally characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are often clustered closely together, giving it a foliage-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, which are typically found at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain forest ecosystems.</p>
