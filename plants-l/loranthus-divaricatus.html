                    <h1>Loranthus divaricatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus divaricatus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits through the sugars it produces. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and Africa, often found in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
