                    <h1>Loranthus barbellatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus barbellatus, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Asia and is often seen growing on trees such as mango and tamarind.</p>
