<p>Lotus juzepczukii, commonly known as the Juzepczuk's lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
