<p>Limosella inflata, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Halocarpaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its inflated, bladder-like structures that help it float on water surfaces. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Limosella inflata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
