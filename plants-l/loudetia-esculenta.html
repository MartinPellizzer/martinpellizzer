<p>Loudetia esculenta, commonly known as the African grass or wild millet, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers, typically in shades of green or brown. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and nutritional value, it is sometimes used as a forage crop or for erosion control.</p>
