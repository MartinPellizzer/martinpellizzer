<p>Lastrea flexilis, commonly known as the flexible lastrea, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lastrea flexilis is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
