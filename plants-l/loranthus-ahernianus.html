                    <h1>Loranthus ahernianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ahernianus, commonly known as the Ahern's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and lacks true roots, relying on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Loranthus ahernianus plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
