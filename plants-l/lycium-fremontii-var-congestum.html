                    <h1>Lycium fremontii var. congestum</h1>
<p>Lycium fremontii var. congestum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its botanical characteristics, including its succulent stems and compact growth form, make it well-suited for desert conditions.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local fauna.</p>
