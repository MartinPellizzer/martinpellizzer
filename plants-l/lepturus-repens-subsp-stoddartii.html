<p>Lepturus repens subsp.</p>
<p>stoddartii, commonly known as the Stoddart's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it a characteristic species of tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
