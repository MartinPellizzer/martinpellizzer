<p>Litobrochia organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss and reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>Litobrochia organensis is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
