                    <h1>Leptaspis cochleata</h1>
<p>Leptaspis cochleata, commonly known as the spiral leaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle belonging to the family Chrysomelidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped markings on its elytra, which give it its common name. The plant it feeds on is typically a species of the genus *Cochlearia*, which are flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Its larvae are often found feeding on the leaves of these host plants, contributing to their ecological role as herbivores.</p>
<p>The beetle's life cycle includes several stages, with adults emerging in the spring to continue the cycle.</p>
