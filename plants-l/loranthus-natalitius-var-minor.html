                    <h1>Loranthus natalitius var. minor</h1>
<p>Loranthus natalitius var. minor, commonly known as the Natal mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its hemiparasitic relationship with its host. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees for dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is native to southern Africa and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas.</p>
