                    <h1>Loranthus leschenaultii</h1>
<p>Loranthus leschenaultii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for birds. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Loranthus leschenaultii is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
