                    <h1>Lapanthus</h1>
<p>Lapanthus, commonly known as the "flowering lichen," is a unique plant that exhibits characteristics of both fungi and algae.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. Lapanthus is typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body made up of both the fungal and algal components.</p>
<p>The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on its symbiotic partners for nutrition and structure.</p>
