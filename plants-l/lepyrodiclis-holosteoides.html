<p>Lepyrodiclis holosteoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
