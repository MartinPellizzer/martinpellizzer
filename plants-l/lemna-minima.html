                    <h1>Lemna minima</h1>
<p>Lemna minima, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with leaves typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Its simple morphology includes tiny, oval leaves and tiny flowers that produce small, yellowish fruits.</p>
<p>Lemna minima is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
