                    <h1>Lorentea decumbens</h1>
<p>Lorentea decumbens, commonly known as the creeping lily or dwarf lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, sprawling habit, featuring a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Lorentea decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
