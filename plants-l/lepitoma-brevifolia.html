                    <h1>Lepitoma brevifolia</h1>
<p>Lepitoma brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved lepidote, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lepidoteae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepitoma brevifolia is considered a botanically significant but poorly studied species.</p>
