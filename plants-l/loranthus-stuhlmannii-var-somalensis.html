                    <h1>Loranthus stuhlmannii var. somalensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus stuhlmannii var. somalensis, commonly known as the Somali mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalaceae family and derives its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It is native to the Horn of Africa, particularly Somalia, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
