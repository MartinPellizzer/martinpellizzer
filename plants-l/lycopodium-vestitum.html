                    <h1>Lycopodium vestitum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium vestitum, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium vestitum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and botanical interest.</p>
