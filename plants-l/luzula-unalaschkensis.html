<p>Luzula unalaschkensis, commonly known as the Alaskan woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils in tundra and alpine environments. The plant features dense,丛生的 shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Luzula unalaschkensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms.</p>
