                <h1>Loudetia migiurtina</h1>
<p>Loudetia migiurtina, commonly known as the desert grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, tufted growth habit and bright red or purple-colored inflorescences, which are often strikingly visible against the sandy or rocky terrain. The plant has fibrous roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of hairs, which reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Loudetia migiurtina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
