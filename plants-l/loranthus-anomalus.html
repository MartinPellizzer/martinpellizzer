                    <h1>Loranthus anomalus</h1>
<p>Loranthus anomalus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using its green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or greenish in color. Its berries are red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus anomalus plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
