<p>Leersia parviflora, commonly known as small-flower sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetlands.</p>
<p>Leersia parviflora plays a role in providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms.</p>
