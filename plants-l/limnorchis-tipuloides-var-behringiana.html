                    <h1>Limnorchis tipuloides var. behringiana</h1>
<p>Limnorchis tipuloides var. behringiana, commonly known as the Beringian marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in wet meadows or along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, rhizomatous root system.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
