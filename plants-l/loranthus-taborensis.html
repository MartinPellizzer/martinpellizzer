                    <h1>Loranthus taborensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus taborensis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pink flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are consumed by birds that help disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, despite its parasitic nature.</p>
