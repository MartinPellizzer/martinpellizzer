                    <h1>Lepidaploa fruticosa</h1>
<p>Lepidaploa fruticosa, commonly known as the mountain cholla, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody structure and ability to store water make it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Lepidaploa fruticosa plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
