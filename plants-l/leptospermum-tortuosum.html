                    <h1>Leptospermum tortuosum</h1>
<p>Leptospermum tortuosum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate salt spray.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its primary ecological role is in stabilizing dune systems.</p>
