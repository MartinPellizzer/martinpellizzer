                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. holoerythra</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. holoerythra, commonly known as the red-flowered twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which contrast with the typical white or pink hues of the species. The plant features small, opposite leaves and produces two small, bell-shaped flowers per stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as boreal forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and its role in ecological studies of plant variation.</p>
