                    <h1>Loranthus crataevae</h1>
<p>Loranthus crataevae, commonly known as the dogwood dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily members of the Cornaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the fruit, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>Loranthus crataevae is often found in temperate regions and can be a common sight in forested areas.</p>
