                    <h1>Launaea acanthodes var. pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Launaea acanthodes var. pulverulenta, commonly known as the dusty launaea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with a sprawling growth habit, featuring hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its adaptive features, such as reduced leaf surface and succulent stems, help it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora.</p>
