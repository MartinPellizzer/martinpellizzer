<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
