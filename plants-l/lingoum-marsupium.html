                    <h1>Lingoum marsupium</h1>
<p>Lingoum marsupium, commonly known as the pouch lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its distinctive, cup-like or pouch-shaped thallus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is typically found growing on tree bark in temperate forest environments. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its thallus for nutrient absorption and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Lingoum marsupium is often used as an indicator species for assessing air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
