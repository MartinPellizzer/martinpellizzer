                    <h1>Lesquerella alpina var. spatulata</h1>
<p>Lesquerella alpina var. spatulata, commonly known as the alpine lesquerella, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, spatulate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it tolerates cold temperatures and low nutrient conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard, waxy coating, which aids in their dispersal and survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to alpine ecosystems.</p>
