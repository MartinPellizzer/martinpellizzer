                    <h1>Lasianthus tubifer</h1>
<p>Lasianthus tubifer, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Lasianthus, is a member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy coating to repel water.</p>
<p>The flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive structures, facilitating self-pollination.</p>
