<p>Limnanthes versicolor, commonly known as the common evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated fruit that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
