<p>Lastrea caduca, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its stems are typically short and branching, with a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lastrea caduca is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, low-nutrient environments.</p>
