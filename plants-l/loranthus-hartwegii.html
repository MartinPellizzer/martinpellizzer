                    <h1>Loranthus hartwegii</h1>
<p>Loranthus hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Quercus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a small, inconspicuous appearance with small, oval leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
