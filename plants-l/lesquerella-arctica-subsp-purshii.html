<p>Lesquerella arctica subsp.</p>
<p>purshii, commonly known as Arctic lesquerella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic tundra. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a compact growth habit adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It is characterized by its ability to produce a unique seed oil rich in erucic acid, which has industrial applications.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar morphological and chemical traits.</p>
