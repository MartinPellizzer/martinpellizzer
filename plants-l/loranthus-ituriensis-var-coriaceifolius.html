                    <h1>Loranthus ituriensis var. coriaceifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus ituriensis var. coriaceifolius, commonly known as the Iuriensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It possesses small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various birds and mammals. As a parasitic species, it derives some of its nutrients from the host plant, while also performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant in maintaining the balance of forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing sustenance for wildlife.</p>
