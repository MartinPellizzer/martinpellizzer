<p>Liparis loeselii subsp.</p>
<p>nemoralis, commonly known as the woodland orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flower spike that produces a single, pale green to brownish flower.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often overlooked due to their subdued coloration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
