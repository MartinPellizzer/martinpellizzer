                    <h1>Lindsaea beddomei</h1>
<p>Lindsaea beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's maidenhair, is a rare and delicate fern native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lindsaea beddomei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
