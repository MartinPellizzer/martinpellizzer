<p>Lemna conjugata, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are usually less than 1 cm in diameter and have a waxy surface. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the buds on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and ditches.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems.</p>
