<p>Lupinus uncinatus, commonly known as the hooked lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant has palmately divided leaves with three to five leaflets, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Lupinus uncinatus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
