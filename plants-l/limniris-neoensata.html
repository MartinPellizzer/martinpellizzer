                    <h1>Limniris neoensata</h1>
<p>Limniris neoensata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>Limniris neoensata plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
