                    <h1>Limnophila geoffrayi</h1>
<p>Limnophila geoffrayi, commonly known as the water thyme, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Limnophila geoffrayi produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
