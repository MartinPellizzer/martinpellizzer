                    <h1>Lycopodium lancifolium</h1>
<p>Lycopodium lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia that release spores for reproduction. Lycopodium lancifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
