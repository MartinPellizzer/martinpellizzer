                    <h1>Limonium gerberi</h1>
<p>Limonium gerberi, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and clusters of small, delicate blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Limonium gerberi is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
