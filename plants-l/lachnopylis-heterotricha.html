                    <h1>Lachnopylis heterotricha</h1>
<p>Lachnopylis heterotricha, commonly known as the narrowleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly packed, leaf-like thallus with a greenish to yellowish upper surface and a darker, granular lower surface. The plant forms symbiotic associations with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
