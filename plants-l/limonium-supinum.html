                    <h1>Limonium supinum</h1>
<p>Limonium supinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and striking blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of many small, scale-like florets. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Limonium supinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions.</p>
