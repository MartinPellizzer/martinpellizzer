<p>Lotus linearis, commonly known as the slender water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green and oval in shape, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes.</p>
<p>Lotus linearis is known for its ability to thrive in still water and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
