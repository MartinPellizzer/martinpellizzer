                    <h1>Lessertia emarginata</h1>
<p>Lessertia emarginata, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The sap of Lessertia emarginata is milky and can cause skin irritation, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the "milk tree.".</p>
