                    <h1>Lyonsia straminea</h1>
<p>Lyonsia straminea, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a unique botanical structure composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments, forming a dense, crust-like thallus. The plant's thallus is usually yellow-green in color, with a leathery texture that allows it to retain moisture effectively. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its symbiotic partners for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Lyonsia straminea plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
