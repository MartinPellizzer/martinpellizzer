                    <h1>Lobivia pygmaea var. tafnaensis</h1>
<p>Lobivia pygmaea var. tafnaensis, commonly known as the Tafnaensis Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Algeria.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive blue-green hue and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
