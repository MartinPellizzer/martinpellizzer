<p>Lepidophyllum acaule, commonly known as the naked-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves and flowers emerging directly from the roots. The plant has small, white or greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants.</p>
<p>Lepidophyllum acaule is often found growing on the branches of trees such as juniper and oak, relying on its host for water and nutrients.</p>
