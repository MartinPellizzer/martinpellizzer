                    <h1>Loranthus hoffmannseggianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus hoffmannseggianus, commonly known as the Hoffmannsegg's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds in return. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are attractive to birds. Its growth is limited to the canopy of its host, where it forms dense clusters and can significantly affect the host's health if left unchecked.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
