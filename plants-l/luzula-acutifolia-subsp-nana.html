<p>Luzula acutifolia subsp.</p>
<p>nana, commonly known as dwarf tufted sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy along the edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ability to form dense mats make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation.</p>
