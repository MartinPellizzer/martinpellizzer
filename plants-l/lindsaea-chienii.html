                    <h1>Lindsaea chienii</h1>
<p>Lindsaea chienii, commonly known as the Chien's spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lindsaeaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters at the tips of its branches, which are typically borne on short, specialized shoots called sporophylls. Lindsaea chienii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to its habitat, with features that aid in water retention and spore dispersal.</p>
