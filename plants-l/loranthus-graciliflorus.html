                    <h1>Loranthus graciliflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus graciliflorus, commonly known as the slender-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into haustoria. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions, where it thrives in humid, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
