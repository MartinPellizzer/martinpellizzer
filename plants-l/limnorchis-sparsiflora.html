<p>Limnorchis sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered water-plantain, is a aquatic plant belonging to the Alismataceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom during the summer months. Limnorchis sparsiflora thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life.</p>
