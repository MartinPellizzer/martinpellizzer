                    <h1>Lactuca dentata var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Lactuca dentata var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous prickly lettuce, is a variant of the prickly lettuce species.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features a rosette of serrated, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine spines. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>The stolons, or runners, allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and disturbed soils.</p>
