                    <h1>Lycopodium robustum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium robustum, commonly known as the club moss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing structures called strobili.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. Lycopodium robustum reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and it plays an important role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest groups of land plants.</p>
