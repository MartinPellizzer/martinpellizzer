<p>Leontopodium discolor, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow inflorescence, which consists of many small, showy flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with poor soil and harsh weather conditions. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and alpine beauty.</p>
