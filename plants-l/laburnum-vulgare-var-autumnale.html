<p>Laburnum vulgare var. autumnale, commonly known as the autumnal laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, with slender, pointed leaflets that turn a striking coppery red in the autumn. This variety is notable for its extended flowering period compared to the common laburnum, often blooming into early autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
