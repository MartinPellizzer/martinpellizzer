                    <h1>Luzula multiflora var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Luzula multiflora var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high elevations, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize open, disturbed areas in mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
