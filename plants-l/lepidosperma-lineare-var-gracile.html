                    <h1>Lepidosperma lineare var. gracile</h1>
<p>Lepidosperma lineare var. gracile, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the base of the spike.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical *Lepidosperma lineare*.</p>
