                    <h1>Lastrea pulvinulifera var. zeylanica</h1>
<p>Lastrea pulvinulifera var. zeylanica, commonly known as the Zeylanica lastrea, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variant is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens.</p>
