<p>Lepisorus stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>

The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat.</p>
<p>Lepisorus stewartii is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
