<p>Listera patentifolia, commonly known as the white wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating and produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are edible, though the plant has a mild, tangy flavor due to its oxalic acid content.</p>
