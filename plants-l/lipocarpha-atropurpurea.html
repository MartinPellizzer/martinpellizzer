                    <h1>Lipocarpha atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Lipocarpha atropurpurea, commonly known as purple marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or purple in color, and it thrives in saline or brackish water environments. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil in marshes, making it ecologically significant in coastal and wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Lipocarpha atropurpurea is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate flooding and poor soil conditions.</p>
