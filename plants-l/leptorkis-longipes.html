                    <h1>Leptorkis longipes</h1>
<p>Leptorkis longipes, commonly known as the long-footed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with distinctive sepals and petals that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as mountainous forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
