                    <h1>Loheria sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Loheria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf loheria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and modest floral display, it is appreciated by botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
