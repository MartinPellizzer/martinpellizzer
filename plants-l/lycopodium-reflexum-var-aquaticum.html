                    <h1>Lycopodium reflexum var. aquaticum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium reflexum var. aquaticum, commonly known as the water clubmoss, is a rare and aquatic variant of the clubmoss family.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures on the water's surface. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporophytes, are borne on specialized stems that emerge from the water.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
