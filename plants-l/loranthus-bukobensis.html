                    <h1>Loranthus bukobensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus bukobensis, commonly known as the Bukoban mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the rainforest regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also photosynthesizing to some extent using its small leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing host tree health and providing food for wildlife.</p>
