                    <h1>Lotus tenuifolius var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Lotus tenuifolius var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss and provides structural support. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in early summer. Its rhizomes grow submerged in water, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
