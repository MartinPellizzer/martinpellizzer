                    <h1>Loranthus rotundifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus rotundifolius, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, typically the oak.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It plays a role in ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals, and its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it is not considered harmful to its host in most cases.</p>
