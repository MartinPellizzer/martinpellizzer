                    <h1>Lithocardium poeppigii</h1>
<p>Lithocardium poeppigii, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Lithocardium poeppigii is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
