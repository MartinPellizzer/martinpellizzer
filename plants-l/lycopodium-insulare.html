                    <h1>Lycopodium insulare</h1>
<p>Lycopodium insulare, commonly known as the island clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stem. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium insulare thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early vascular plant evolution.</p>
