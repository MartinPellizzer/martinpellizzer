<p>Litobrochia grandifolia, commonly known as the grandiflorous rockbloom, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright pink, often with contrasting white markings. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Litobrochia grandifolia is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
