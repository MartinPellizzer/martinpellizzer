<p>Lemna perpusilla, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the order Alismatales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, often appearing in clusters. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation, making it highly adaptable.</p>
<p>Lemna perpusilla thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
