                    <h1>Loranthus fasciculatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, and its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus fasciculatus is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Its growth pattern and parasitic nature make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
