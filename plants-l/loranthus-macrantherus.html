<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, white or pinkish flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
