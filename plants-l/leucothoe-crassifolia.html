                    <h1>Leucothoe crassifolia</h1>
<p>Leucothoe crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal color changes, as well as its ability to provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
