<p>Leucaena macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often large and trifoliate, with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical seed pods. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in agroforestry systems for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
<p>Leucaena macrophylla is also valued for its forage value and ability to prevent soil erosion.</p>
