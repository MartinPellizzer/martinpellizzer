                    <h1>Lathyrus venosus var. intonsus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus venosus var. intonsus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with a distinctive venation pattern, and its pods contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
