                    <h1>Launaea arborescens</h1>
<p>Launaea arborescens, commonly known as the tree dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant with a branched stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, often resembling a small tree. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse via the wind. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Launaea arborescens is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
