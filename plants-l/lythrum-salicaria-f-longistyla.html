                    <h1>Lythrum salicaria f. longistyla</h1>
<p>Lythrum salicaria f. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled sweetroot, is a botanical variant of the common loosestrife.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated stigmas, which distinguish it from the typical form of Lythrum salicaria. This perennial herb is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its striking pink to purple flowers bloom in spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant has a fibrous root system and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats.</p>
