<p>Lamprococcus cathcartii, commonly known as the Cathcart's lamprococcus, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa, where it primarily infests certain species of Protea. The plant is characterized by its small, shield-shaped body covered in waxy secretions. It is often found on the leaves and stems of its host plants, feeding on plant sap.</p>
<p>Due to its specific host range and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and entomologists studying plant-insect interactions.</p>
