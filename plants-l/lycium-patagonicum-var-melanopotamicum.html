<p>Lycium patagonicum var. melanopotamicum, commonly known as the Patagonian boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, red berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Lycium species but is distinguished by its unique geographic distribution and morphological traits.</p>
