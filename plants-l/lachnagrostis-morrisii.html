<p>Lachnagrostis morrisii, commonly known as Morris' wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Lachnagrostis morrisii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
