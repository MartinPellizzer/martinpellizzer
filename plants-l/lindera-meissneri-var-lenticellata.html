                    <h1>Lindera meissneri var. lenticellata</h1>
<p>Lindera meissneri var. lenticellata, commonly known as the lenticellate boxwood, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.</p>
