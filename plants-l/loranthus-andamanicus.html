                    <h1>Loranthus andamanicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus andamanicus, commonly known as the Andaman mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to potential host trees.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife.</p>
