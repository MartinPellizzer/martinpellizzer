                    <h1>Lithobium cordatum</h1>
<p>Lithobium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf lithobium, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Lithobium cordatum is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
