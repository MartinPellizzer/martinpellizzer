<p>Lyonnetia, commonly known as the false mignonette, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and small, often fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. Lyonnetia species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though they are not widely grown in gardens.</p>
<p>The fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds.</p>
