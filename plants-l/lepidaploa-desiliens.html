                    <h1>Lepidaploa desiliens</h1>
<p>Lepidaploa desiliens, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a robust, branching stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, adorned with lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with showy, reflexed petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Lepidaploa desiliens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
