                    <h1>Lolium humile</h1>
<p>Lolium humile, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is adapted to temperate climates and is often used in pasture and erosion control due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>Lolium humile is also a common weed in agricultural settings, thriving in nutrient-rich soils.</p>
