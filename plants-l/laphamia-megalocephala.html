<p>Laphamia megalocephala, commonly known as the giant-headed laphamia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spherical shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
