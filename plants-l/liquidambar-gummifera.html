<p>Liquidambar gummifera, commonly known as the gum linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its most notable feature is the production of a sticky, resinous sap that has been used historically for medicinal and industrial purposes.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
