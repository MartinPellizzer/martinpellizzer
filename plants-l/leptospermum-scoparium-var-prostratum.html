                    <h1>Leptospermum scoparium var. prostratum</h1>
<p>Leptospermum scoparium var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate tea tree, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the more well-known manuka, but differs in its prostrate growth habit.</p>
