<p>Leucothoe neriifolia, commonly known as the redleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that turn a striking red or orange-red color in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. Its moderate growth habit and ability to thrive in partial shade make it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical characteristics include opposite leaf arrangement and a woody stem structure typical of the Hamamelidaceae family.</p>
