                    <h1>Loranthus aphyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and roots. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
