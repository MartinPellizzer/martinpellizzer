                    <h1>Loranthus lucarquensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus lucarquensis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some photosynthetic support through its own leaves. It produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
