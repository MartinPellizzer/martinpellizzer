<p>Lycopodium porophilum, commonly known as the porose clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium porophilum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain forest ecosystems.</p>
