<p>Lappula cinerea, commonly known as gray lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks, marshes, and damp meadows. The plant has a slender, branching stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from June to August.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed, hairy capsule, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
