<p>Lecythis fendleriana, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by large, woody fruits containing up to 20 seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi and plays a vital role in the ecological balance of the rainforest.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species.</p>
