                    <h1>Lotus salzmannii</h1>
<p>Lotus salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's lotus, is a rare and endangered aquatic plant native to the western Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom substrate while its stems and leaves remain above water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
