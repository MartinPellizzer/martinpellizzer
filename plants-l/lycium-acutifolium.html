<p>Lycium acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Lycium acutifolium is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a hardy plant often used in xeriscaping and as a natural barrier due to its thorny nature.</p>
