<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>Linaria litoralis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
