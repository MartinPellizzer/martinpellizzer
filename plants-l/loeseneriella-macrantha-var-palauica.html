<p>Loeseneriella macrantha var. palauica, commonly known as the Palau stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the island of Palau in the western Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
