<p>Leiochilus resinosus, commonly known as the resinous leiochilus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are deep and fibrous, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its sticky, resinous secretions, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
