                    <h1>Loranthus domingensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are adapted for bird dispersal. Its leaves are usually scale-like, and it has a symbiotic relationship with its host, though it can cause stress or damage to the tree.</p>
<p>Loranthus domingensis is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, thriving in humid environments.</p>
