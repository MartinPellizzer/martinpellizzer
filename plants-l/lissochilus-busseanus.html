<p>Lissochilus busseanus, commonly known as the Busse's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flower that resembles a small cup, which is a distinctive feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
