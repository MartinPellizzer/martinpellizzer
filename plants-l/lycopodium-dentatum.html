                    <h1>Lycopodium dentatum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium dentatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its historical significance in paleobotany highlights its role in the evolution of early land plants.</p>
