<p>Lycopodium hamiltonii var. petiolatum, commonly known as the petiolate clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures containing sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its petiolate (having a stalk) leaves, which set it apart from other varieties of Lycopodium hamiltonii.</p>
