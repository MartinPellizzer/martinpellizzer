                    <h1>Loranthus affinis</h1>
<p>Loranthus affinis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
