                    <h1>Limnia asarifolia</h1>
<p>Limnia asarifolia, commonly known as the fragrant water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in shallow, still waters.</p>
<p>Limnia asarifolia is valued for its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
