                    <h1>Loranthus griseus</h1>
<p>Loranthus griseus, commonly known as the gray mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus griseus plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
