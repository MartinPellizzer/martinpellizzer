                    <h1>Lagurus humilis</h1>
<p>Lagurus humilis, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and early blooming habit, it is a valuable plant for early pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
