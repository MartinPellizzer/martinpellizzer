                    <h1>Lactuca taliiensis</h1>
<p>Lactuca taliiensis, commonly known as the Talis mountain lettuce, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly found in the Talysh Mountains of Iran and Azerbaijan. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the dandelion family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lactuca taliiensis is considered a botanically significant but poorly studied species.</p>
