<p>Lobivia hastifera, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded body and spiny, paddle-shaped stems that are often covered in white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Lobivia hastifera is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
