<p>Lithocarpus braianensis subsp.</p>
<p>brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its hard, dense wood and evergreen foliage. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are革质 (leathery) and elliptical in shape, often with a glossy upper surface and a lighter-colored underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inedible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which are dispersed by animals and contribute to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
