<p>Lobivia rosarioana var. rubriflora, commonly known as the Red-flowered Lobivia, is a compact, short-stemmed cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tint, adorned with dense clusters of spines. The plant produces vibrant red flowers during the spring, which contrast strikingly with its foliage. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
