                    <h1>Linaria glacialis var. leiosperma</h1>
<p>Linaria glacialis var. leiosperma, commonly known as the glacier flax or alpine flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that form a dense mat, often carpeting rocky slopes and gravelly soils. The plant produces bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly succulent texture adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Linaria glacialis var. leiosperma is well-suited to high-altitude habitats and is often used in alpine gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
