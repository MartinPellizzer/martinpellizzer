                    <h1>Lophostachys diandra</h1>
<p>Lophostachys diandra, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters, featuring basal rosettes of gray-green, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by pale green, woolly fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in low-water conditions.</p>
<p>Lophostachys diandra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
