<p>Leobordea lotoides, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with its leaves floating on the water surface while its roots are submerged. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters near the water's edge.</p>
<p>Leobordea lotoides plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms.</p>
