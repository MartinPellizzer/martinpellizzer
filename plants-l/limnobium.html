<p>Limnobium, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeraliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Limnobium species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the substrate, while their leaves float on the water surface.</p>
<p>The flowers attract pollinators like beetles and bees, playing a vital role in the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
