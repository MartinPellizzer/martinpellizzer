                    <h1>Loranthus tanganyikae</h1>
<p>Loranthus tanganyikae, commonly known as the Tanganyika mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the forests of East Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches to its host trees, primarily figs and other hardwoods, through a specialized root system called a haustellum. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Its small, white or greenish flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Loranthus tanganyikae is considered vulnerable and is of interest in ecological and conservation studies.</p>
