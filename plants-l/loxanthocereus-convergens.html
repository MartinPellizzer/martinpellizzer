                    <h1>Loxanthocereus convergens</h1>
<p>Loxanthocereus convergens, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its flowers typically open only during the evening and close by dawn, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil.</p>
