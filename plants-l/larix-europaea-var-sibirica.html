                    <h1>Larix europaea var. sibirica</h1>
<p>Larix europaea var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before shedding. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its wood is lightweight and durable, historically used for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>This hardy species is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
