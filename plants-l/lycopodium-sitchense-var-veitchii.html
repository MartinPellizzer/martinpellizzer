                    <h1>Lycopodium sitchense var. veitchii</h1>
<p>Lycopodium sitchense var. veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the Lycophyta division.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and strobilus structures that produce spores. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, reflecting its evolutionary adaptation to spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
