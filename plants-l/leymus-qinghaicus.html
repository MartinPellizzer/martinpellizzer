<p>Leymus qinghaicus, commonly known as the Qinghai wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Leymus qinghaicus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
