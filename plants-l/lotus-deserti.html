<p>Lotus deserti, commonly known as the desert globe-mallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Lotus deserti is well adapted to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
