                    <h1>Lomaria uliginosa</h1>
<p>Lomaria uliginosa, commonly known as the bog lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands.</p>
<p>It is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The plant has a crust-like appearance, forming dense mats on the surface of the soil or rocks. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
