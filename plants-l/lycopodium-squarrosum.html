                    <h1>Lycopodium squarrosum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrosum clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can anchor itself to substrates with its root-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-shaped and contain spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Lycopodium squarrosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
