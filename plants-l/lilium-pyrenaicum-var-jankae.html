<p>Lilium pyrenaicum var. jankae, commonly known as the Jankai pyrenean lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive red stripe along the inner petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
