<p>Lacandonia schismatica, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a short stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the spring season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to extinction.</p>
