<p>Limnophila taoyuanensis, commonly known as the Taoyuan water plantain, is a rare aquatic flowering plant native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
