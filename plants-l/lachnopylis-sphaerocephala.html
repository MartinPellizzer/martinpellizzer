                    <h1>Lachnopylis sphaerocephala</h1>
<p>Lachnopylis sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed lichen, is a species of foliose lichen characterized by its distinctive, rounded thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate to subarctic regions. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and specialized habitat make it an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
