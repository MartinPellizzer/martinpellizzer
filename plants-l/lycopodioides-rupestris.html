                    <h1>Lycopodioides rupestris</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides rupestris, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or arid environments, where it forms dense mats on stone surfaces. The plant has primitive vascular structures, including rhizomes and leaves that are usually scale-like. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the tips of the stems, and it relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>Lycopodioides rupestris is often found in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
