<p>Lastreopsis marginans, commonly known as the coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Lastreopsis marginans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
