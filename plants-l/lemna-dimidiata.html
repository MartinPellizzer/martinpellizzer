                    <h1>Lemna dimidiata</h1>
<p>Lemna dimidiata, commonly known as the lesser duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped floating leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Lemna dimidiata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
