                    <h1>Loranthus viguieri</h1>
<p>Loranthus viguieri, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval leaves and white, waxy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
