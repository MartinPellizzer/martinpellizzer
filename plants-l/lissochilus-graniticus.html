                    <h1>Lissochilus graniticus</h1>
<p>Lissochilus graniticus, commonly known as the granite orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly in regions with rocky or granitic substrates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on exposed rock faces or in crevices. Its root system is adapted to anchor itself in loose, mineral-rich soil, and it requires good drainage to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
