<p>Leptorkis vexillifera, commonly known as the flagellate orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and large, showy flowers that resemble flags, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchid species.</p>
<p>Leptorkis vexillifera is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
