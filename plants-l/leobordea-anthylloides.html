<p>It is a perennial herb with a compact, rosette-like growth habit, featuring dense, silver-tomentose leaves that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and requires moderate to low water conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
