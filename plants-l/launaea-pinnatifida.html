                    <h1>Launaea pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Launaea pinnatifida, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Launaea pinnatifida is native to regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of southern Asia.</p>
