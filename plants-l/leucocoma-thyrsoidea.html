<p>Leucocoma thyrsoidea, commonly known as the white thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear small, clustered flowers in shades of white and purple. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
