<p>Lycopodium sanctae-barbarae, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a species of clubmoss that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and its distinctive, fern-like fronds. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in cloud forests and humid woodlands, where it contributes to the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its natural habitat.</p>
