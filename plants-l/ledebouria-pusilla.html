<p>Ledebouria pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous hyacinth, is a small, bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring. It is often grown as a rock garden plant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and container gardening.</p>
