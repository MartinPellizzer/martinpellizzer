                    <h1>Lepturus filiformis f. ramosissima</h1>
<p>Lepturus filiformis f. ramosissima, commonly known as the branched filiform lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus.</p>
<p>It exhibits a pale yellow to orange-brown coloration, with a finely branched structure that gives it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree bark or soil in temperate forests. It is known for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality.</p>
<p>The fructification consists of apothecia that are small and usually located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
