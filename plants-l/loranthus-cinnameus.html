                    <h1>Loranthus cinnameus</h1>
<p>Loranthus cinnameus, commonly known as the cinnamon or Indian satinwood mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as mango and tamarind.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its berries, which are fleshy and edible.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
