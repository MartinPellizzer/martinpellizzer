                    <h1>Loranthus stolzii</h1>
<p>Loranthus stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
