                    <h1>Lycopodium simulans</h1>
<p>Lycopodium simulans, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of pine needles. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores rather than seeds. Lycopodium simulans thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
