<p>Logania litoralis, commonly known as the coastal logania, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils near the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Logania litoralis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
