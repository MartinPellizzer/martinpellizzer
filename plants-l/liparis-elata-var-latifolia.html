                    <h1>Liparis elata var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Liparis elata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
