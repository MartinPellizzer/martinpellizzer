<p>Lenticula polyrrhiza, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
