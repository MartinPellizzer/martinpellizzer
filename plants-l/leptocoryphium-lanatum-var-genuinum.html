                    <h1>Leptocoryphium lanatum var. genuinum</h1>
<p>Leptocoryphium lanatum var. genuinum, commonly known as the slender-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom during the wet season, typically from June to September. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it can receive the dappled light it requires for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
