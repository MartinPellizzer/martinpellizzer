<p>Leea hirta, commonly known as the hairy leaf vine, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Leea hirta is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
