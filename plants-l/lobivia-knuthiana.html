The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus and succulent enthusiasts.</p>
