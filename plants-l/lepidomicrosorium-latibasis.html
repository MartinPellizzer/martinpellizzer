<p>Lepidomicrosorium latibasis, commonly known as the broad-based water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are thin and wiry, anchoring it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
