                    <h1>Lathyrus purpureus</h1>
<p>Lathyrus purpureus, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with purple veins. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
