<p>Lethedon microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved lethedon, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Lethedon microphylla is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
