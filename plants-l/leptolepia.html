                    <h1>Leptolepia</h1>
<p>Leptolepia, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its unique fronds and spore structures.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds of Leptolepia are usually divided into segments, giving them a distinctive, shield-like appearance. They produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are often clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Leptolepia species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
