                    <h1>Leptosiphon androsaceus</h1>
<p>Leptosiphon androsaceus, commonly known as the Androsace bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
