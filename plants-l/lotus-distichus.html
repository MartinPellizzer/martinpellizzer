<p>Lotus distichus, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Lotus distichus plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
