                    <h1>Lotus australis var. australis</h1>
<p>Lotus australis var. australis, commonly known as the Australian water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Australia.</p>
<p>It features large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically from late summer to autumn. Its roots form a dense mat beneath the water, helping to stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits in freshwater ecosystems.</p>
