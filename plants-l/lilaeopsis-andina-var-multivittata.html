<p>Lilaeopsis andina var. multivittata, commonly known as the Andean grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh mountain environments, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine regions.</p>
