                    <h1>Lampaya</h1>
<p>Lampaya, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant has a distinctive white flower that blooms at night, releasing a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its roots anchor it in the muddy bottom, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats.</p>
<p>Lampaya plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and stabilizing water bodies.</p>
