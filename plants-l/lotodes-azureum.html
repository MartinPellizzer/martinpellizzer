<p>Lotodes azureum, commonly known as the blue water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water and absorbing nutrients from the substrate.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens.</p>
