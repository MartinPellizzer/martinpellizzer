                    <h1>Latourorchis atroviolacea</h1>
<p>Latourorchis atroviolacea, commonly known as the black violet orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark violet petals and sepals, which contrast sharply with its white or pale yellow lip. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, this orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Latourorchis atroviolacea is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
