<p>Lygodium volubile var. hirtum, commonly known as the hairy climbing fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive, compound fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation.</p>
