                    <h1>Lavoisiera uliginosa</h1>
<p>Lavoisiera uliginosa, commonly known as the bog lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Lavoisiera uliginosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
