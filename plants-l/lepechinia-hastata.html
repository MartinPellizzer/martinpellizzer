                    <h1>Lepechinia hastata</h1>
<p>Lepechinia hastata, commonly known as the narrowleaf lepechinia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
