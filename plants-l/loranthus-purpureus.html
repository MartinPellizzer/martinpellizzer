                    <h1>Loranthus purpureus</h1>
<p>Loranthus purpureus, commonly known as the purple mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or purple, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
