<p>Loxogramme avenia, commonly known as the creeping water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are often submerged, with small, spore-producing structures called sorocarps. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the pond bottom, helping to stabilize sediment.</p>
<p>Loxogramme avenia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
