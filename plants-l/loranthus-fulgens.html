                    <h1>Loranthus fulgens</h1>
<p>Loranthus fulgens, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are orange-red and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
