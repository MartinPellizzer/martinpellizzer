                    <h1>Lycopodium fastigiatum var. assurgens</h1>
<p>Lycopodium fastigiatum var. assurgens, commonly known as the upright clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form tight clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically located at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
