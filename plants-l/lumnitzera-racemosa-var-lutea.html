                    <h1>Lumnitzera racemosa var. lutea</h1>
<p>Lumnitzera racemosa var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a halophyte native to tropical coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense mangrove forests along shorelines. The plant has pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and typically yellowish-green, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
