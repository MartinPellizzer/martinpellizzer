                    <h1>Lycopodioides depressa</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides depressa, commonly known as the flat mossy clubmoss, is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodioides depressa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ancient lineage provide insight into the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
