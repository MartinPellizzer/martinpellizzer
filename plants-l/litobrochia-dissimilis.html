                    <h1>Litobrochia dissimilis</h1>
<p>Litobrochia dissimilis, commonly known as the rock brochidium, is a small, succulent cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure, which helps it store water efficiently in its native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Litobrochia dissimilis is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and low moisture conditions.</p>
