<p>It is a type of lichen, which is a symbiotic organism composed of algae and fungi, and it thrives in specific, often moist and shaded environments. The plant exhibits a distinctive growth form with a cushion-like structure, and its surface is typically smooth and glabrous, as suggested by its subspecies name. It is often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions, and it plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
