                    <h1>Lachnopylis goetzeana</h1>
<p>Lachnopylis goetzeana, commonly known as the Goetze's lichen, is a member of the family Lichenes, characterized by its symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, rocks, or soil surfaces in temperate to subtropical regions. The plant's thallus is usually crust-like or foliose, with a leathery texture and a color range from pale yellow to dark green. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic partners for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Lachnopylis goetzeana is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
