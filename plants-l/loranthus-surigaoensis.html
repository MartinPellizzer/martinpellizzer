                    <h1>Loranthus surigaoensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus surigaoensis, commonly known as the Surigao mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds in return. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. It is native to the Philippines, particularly in the region of Surigao.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat by influencing host tree growth and supporting various insect populations.</p>
