                    <h1>Leontopodium japonicum var. sandwicense</h1>
<p>Leontopodium japonicum var. sandwicense, commonly known as the Sandwicense edelweiss, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround its small, yellowish flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on rocky slopes and volcanic soils. Its unique morphology is an adaptation to the harsh, cold conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
