                    <h1>Lophophora williamsii</h1>
<p>Lophophora williamsii, commonly known as peyote, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem covered in areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces white, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Peyote contains the psychoactive alkaloid mescaline, which has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for spiritual and medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and limited distribution make it a protected species in many regions.</p>
