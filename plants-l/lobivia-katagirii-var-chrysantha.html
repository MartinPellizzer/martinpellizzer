                    <h1>Lobivia katagirii var. chrysantha</h1>
<p>Lobivia katagirii var. chrysantha, commonly known as the golden lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its succulent stems are ribbed and capable of storing water, a key adaptation to its dry habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
