<p>Leobordea schoenfelderi, commonly known as the Sch√∂enfelder's leobordea, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive purple or red stripe down the center. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
