<p>Linaria × kocianovichii, commonly known as the hybrid common toadflax, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Linaria vulgaris and Linaria dalmatica.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its erect growth habit and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers in raceme-like clusters, which are typical of the Linaria genus. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas.</p>
