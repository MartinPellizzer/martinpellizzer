                            <h1>Luzula Campestris Var. Tristachya</h1>
<p>Field sedge, scientifically known as Luzula campestris var. tristachya, is a hardy perennial plant commonly found in moist, temperate environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their ecological importance. This variety is distinguished by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, spike-like flower clusters. It thrives in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil. Despite its simple appearance, field sedge plays a vital role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
