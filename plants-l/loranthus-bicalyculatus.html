                    <h1>Loranthus bicalyculatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus bicalyculatus, commonly known as the two-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions.</p>
