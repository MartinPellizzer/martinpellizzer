                    <h1>Lobelia nana var. flagelliformis</h1>
<p>Lobelia nana var. flagelliformis, commonly known as the creeping lobe lily, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters atop slender stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators.</p>
