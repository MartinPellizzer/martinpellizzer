<p>Lepidomicrosorium brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed water fern, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to colonize aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
