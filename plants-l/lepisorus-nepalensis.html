<p>Lepisorus nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that display a striking contrast of colors, often with a dark green base and lighter veins. Native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and adjacent areas, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's rhizome is creeping and produces fertile shoots that bear small, spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it requires careful cultivation to maintain its unique appearance.</p>
