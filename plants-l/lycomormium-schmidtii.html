                    <h1>Lycomormium schmidtii</h1>
<p>Lycomormium schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
