<p>Lucilia ferruginea, commonly known as the rust-colored blowfly, is a species of fly found in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Calliphoridae and is known for its metallic, rust-colored body. The plant aspect of this species is not directly relevant, as it is an insect, not a plant. However, it is often associated with decaying organic matter, which can be found in plant-rich environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate the decomposition stage of plant material in an ecosystem.</p>
