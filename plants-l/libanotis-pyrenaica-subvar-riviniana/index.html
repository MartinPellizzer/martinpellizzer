                            <h1>Libanotis Pyrenaica Subvar. Riviniana</h1>
<p>Pyrenean bellflower, scientifically known as Libanotis pyrenaica subvar. riviniana, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. This subshrub is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in rocky stream banks and forested slopes, where it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and climate change, the Pyrenean bellflower is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its unique beauty and ecological significance highlight the importance of preserving biodiversity in mountainous regions.</p>
