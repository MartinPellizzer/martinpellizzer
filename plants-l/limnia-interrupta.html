<p>Limnia interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted waterflea, is a small aquatic crustacean belonging to the order Cyclopida.</p>
<p>It is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant-like appearance of Limnia interrupta is due to its transparent exoskeleton, which can resemble a tiny, leaf-like structure. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as a food source for various fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for water quality.</p>
