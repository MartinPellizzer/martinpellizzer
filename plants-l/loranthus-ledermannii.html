                    <h1>Loranthus ledermannii</h1>
<p>Loranthus ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The small, white or yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species.</p>
