                    <h1>Lindsaea sarasinorum</h1>
<p>Lindsaea sarasinorum, commonly known as the Sarasin's lace fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, intricately divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new growth, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
