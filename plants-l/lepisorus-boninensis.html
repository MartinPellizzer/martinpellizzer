<p>Lepisorus boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Japan and the Bonin Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile shoots, and the sori are clustered in elongated lines on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens.</p>
