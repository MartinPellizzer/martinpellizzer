<p>Lotodes racemosum, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Lotodes, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom substrate while its stems float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pink or white, and they play a role in attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
