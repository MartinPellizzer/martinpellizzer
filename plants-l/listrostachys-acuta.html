<p>Listrostachys acuta, commonly known as the sharp-stemmed acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, raceme-like clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
