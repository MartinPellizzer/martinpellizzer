                    <h1>Loranthus sellowianus</h1>
<p>Loranthus sellowianus, commonly known as the Brazilian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Brazilian rainforest.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the forest canopy.</p>
