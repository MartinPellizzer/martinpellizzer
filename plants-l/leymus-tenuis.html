                    <h1>Leymus tenuis</h1>
<p>Leymus tenuis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 cm wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its fine, delicate appearance and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Leymus tenuis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet conditions and its role in stabilizing soil.</p>
