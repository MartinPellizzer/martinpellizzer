                    <h1>Lachnaea filiformis</h1>
<p>Lachnaea filiformis, commonly known as the slender lachnae, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color, followed by tiny, dry fruits called achenes. Lachnaea filiformis is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry meadows, and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for certain insects and its use in ecological studies of plant-insect interactions.</p>
