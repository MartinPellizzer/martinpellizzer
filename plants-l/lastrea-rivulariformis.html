                    <h1>Lastrea rivulariformis</h1>
<p>Lastrea rivulariformis, commonly known as the rock wallaby or rock wallaby lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium or algae. This lichen is typically found on rock surfaces in semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Its structure is flattened and crust-like, allowing it to retain moisture in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to survive in extreme environments makes it an important indicator of ecological health in its habitat.</p>
