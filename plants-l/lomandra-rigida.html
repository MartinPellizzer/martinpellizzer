<p>Lomandra rigida, commonly known as the rigid lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.
