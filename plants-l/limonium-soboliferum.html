                    <h1>Limonium soboliferum</h1>
<p>Limonium soboliferum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
<p>Limonium soboliferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
