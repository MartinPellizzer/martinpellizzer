                    <h1>Lochemia supina</h1>
<p>Lochemia supina, commonly known as the lying lichen, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits a distinctive growth pattern.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on decaying wood or stone surfaces. The organism consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. Its thallus is flattened and often appears as a dense, crust-like layer on its substrate.</p>
<p>Lochemia supina plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of environmental conditions in its habitat.</p>
