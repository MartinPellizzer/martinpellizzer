                    <h1>Loranthus glaucocarpus</h1>
<p>Loranthus glaucocarpus, commonly known as the glaucous apple or Indian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*, through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various birds and insects.</p>
