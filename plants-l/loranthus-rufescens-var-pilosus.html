                    <h1>Loranthus rufescens var. pilosus</h1>
<p>Loranthus rufescens var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
