<p>Lastrea simozawae, commonly known as the S Mozambique liverwort, is a rare and specialized liverwort species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on damp soil in forested areas. Its reproductive structures, known as archegonia, are embedded within the leaf cushions, facilitating spore production.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lastrea simozawae is considered an endangered species.</p>
