<p>Leontodon crispatus, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender,丛生 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled or wavy at the edges. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early summer, forming loose clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Leontodon crispatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
