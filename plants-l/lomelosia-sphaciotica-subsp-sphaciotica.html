<p>Lomelosia sphaciotica subsp.</p>
<p>sphaciotica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomelosia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
