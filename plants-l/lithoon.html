                    <h1>Lithoon</h1>
<p>Lithoon, commonly known as the rockweed, is a type of seaweed that thrives in rocky coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to brown color and its ability to attach firmly to substrates like rocks and shells. The plant has a complex structure with a holdfast, stipe, and blades, typical of many marine algae. Lithoon plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it an important component of intertidal zones.</p>
