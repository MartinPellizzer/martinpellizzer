<p>Lastrea pellita, commonly known as the silver leaf crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
