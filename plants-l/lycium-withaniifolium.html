                    <h1>Lycium withaniifolium</h1>
<p>Lycium withaniifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces yellowish flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It is adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in arid landscapes.</p>
