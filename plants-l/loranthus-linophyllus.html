<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and fleshy, sticky berries that contain seeds. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is native to Australia and is often found in forested areas.</p>
