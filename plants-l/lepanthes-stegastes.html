<p>Lepanthes stegastes, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the lip. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Lepanthes stegastes plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
