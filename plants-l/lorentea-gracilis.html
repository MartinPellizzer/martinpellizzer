                    <h1>Lorentea gracilis</h1>
<p>Lorentea gracilis, commonly known as the slender loranth, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Eucalyptus, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it relies heavily on its host for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host tree.</p>
