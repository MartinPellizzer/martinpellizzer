                    <h1>Limosella</h1>
<p>Limosella, commonly known as marsh sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, often growing in coastal areas or along riverbanks. They are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves that help them retain moisture. Limosella species are often annual or short-lived perennial herbs, with some species being highly salt-tolerant.</p>
<p>The genus includes around 50 species, many of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
