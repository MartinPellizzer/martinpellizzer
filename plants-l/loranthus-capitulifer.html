                    <h1>Loranthus capitulifer</h1>
<p>Loranthus capitulifer, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by the host's leaves. The plant forms a dense, spherical cluster of small, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a small, sticky capsule that releases seeds capable of adhering to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>This parasitic relationship can significantly impact the health of the host tree over time.</p>
