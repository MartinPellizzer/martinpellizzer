                    <h1>Linnaea borealis f. initiatrix</h1>
<p>Linnaea borealis f. initiatrix, commonly known as the white twinflower, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twin, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant is native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and northern Europe, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its small stature and unique floral structure make it a striking addition to shaded woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
