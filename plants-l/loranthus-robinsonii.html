                    <h1>Loranthus robinsonii</h1>
<p>Loranthus robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, oval leaves and white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
