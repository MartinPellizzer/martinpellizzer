<p>Leptis versicolor, commonly known as the variable leptis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, Leptis versicolor is often cultivated in gardens with limited water resources.</p>
