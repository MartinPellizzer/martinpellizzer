                    <h1>Loranthus acinarius</h1>
<p>Loranthus acinarius, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that contain sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries and later excrete the seeds onto other host trees.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, and it has cultural significance in various traditions.</p>
