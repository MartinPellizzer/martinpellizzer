                    <h1>Loranthus dianthus</h1>
<p>Loranthus dianthus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. It is often found in temperate regions and is associated with various tree species such as apple and hawthorn.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host trees.</p>
