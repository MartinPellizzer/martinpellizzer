<p>Linaria stricta var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers resembling those of the common toadflax. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
