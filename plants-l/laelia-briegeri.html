<p>Laelia briegeri, commonly known as the Brieger's orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its harsh, mountainous habitat. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to the cold and dry conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>Laelia briegeri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under suitable conditions.</p>
