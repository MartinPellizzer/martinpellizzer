<p>Lycopodium complanatum subsp.</p>
<p>anceps, commonly known as the flat clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its closely packed, needle-like leaves that form dense, carpet-like mats on the forest floor.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
