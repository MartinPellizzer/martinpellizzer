<p>Leontopodium nanum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or pale yellow hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in July and August. Its leaves are spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Leontopodium nanum is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions.</p>
