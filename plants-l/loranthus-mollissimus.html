                    <h1>Loranthus mollissimus</h1>
<p>Loranthus mollissimus, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is often found on hosts such as the rubber tree.</p>
<p>Its silky, hair-covered leaves give it a distinctive appearance and help it blend with its surroundings.</p>
