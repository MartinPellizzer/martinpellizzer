<p>Lindsaea lancea var. montana, commonly known as the mountain lindsaea, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to cooler, more humid climates compared to other members of the species.</p>
