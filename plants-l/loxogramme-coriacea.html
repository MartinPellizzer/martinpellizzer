                    <h1>Loxogramme coriacea</h1>
<p>Loxogramme coriacea, commonly known as the rough water clover, is a perennial aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It has slender, branched stems that grow in shallow water, and its leaves are pinnately divided with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Loxogramme coriacea plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
