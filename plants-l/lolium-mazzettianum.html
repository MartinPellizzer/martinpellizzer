                    <h1>Lolium mazzettianum</h1>
<p>Lolium mazzettianum, commonly known as Italian ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted inflorescence, which consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly used in forage and turfgrass mixtures.</p>
<p>Lolium mazzettianum is also an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and high seed production.</p>
