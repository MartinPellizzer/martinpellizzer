                    <h1>Loeflingia gaditana</h1>
<p>Loeflingia gaditana, commonly known as the Mediterranean sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or on rocky shores.</p>
<p>Loeflingia gaditana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems.</p>
