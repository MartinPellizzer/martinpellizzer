<p>Lygodium versteegii, commonly known as the African climbing fern, is a member of the family Lygodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a climbing fern characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Lygodium versteegii is notable for its ability to climb and spread through its rhizomes, making it a common sight in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
