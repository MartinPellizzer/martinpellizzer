                    <h1>Lemna transsilvanica</h1>
<p>Lemna transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian duckweed, is a small, floating aquatic plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through the production of tubers. Lemna transsilvanica thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems, though it can also become invasive in certain conditions.</p>
