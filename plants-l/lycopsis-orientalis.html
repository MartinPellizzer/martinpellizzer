<p>Lycopsis orientalis, commonly known as the oriental lycopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopsidaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that develop into small, dry fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lycopsis orientalis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
