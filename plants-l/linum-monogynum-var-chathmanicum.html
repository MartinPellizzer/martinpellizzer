<p>Linum monogynum var. chathmanicum, commonly known as the Chathman flax, is a rare and distinctive variant of the flax plant native to specific regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats, often in sandy or loamy soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
