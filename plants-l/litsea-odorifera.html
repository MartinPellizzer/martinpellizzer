<p>Litsea odorifera, commonly known as the fragrant laurier or Chinese laurier, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a pleasant scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.
