                    <h1>Lachnostoma lasiostemma</h1>
<p>Lachnostoma lasiostemma, commonly known as the rough-stemmed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark, often reddish or brownish thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is commonly found on rocks and tree bark in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
