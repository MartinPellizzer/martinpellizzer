<p>Lastrea dasyphylla, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems to survive dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss and protects it from intense sunlight.</p>
