                    <h1>Loranthus nigritanus</h1>
<p>Loranthus nigritanus, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits by stimulating growth in the host. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, and its berries are typically black or red, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus nigritanus plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, influencing host tree health and supporting various wildlife species.</p>
