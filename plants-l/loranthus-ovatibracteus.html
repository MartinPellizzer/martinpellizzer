                    <h1>Loranthus ovatibracteus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ovatibracteus, commonly known as the broad-bract mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host through a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It primarily grows on trees such as eucalyptus and acacia, drawing water and nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis with its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy capsule that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The species is native to Australia and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and unique parasitic growth habit.</p>
