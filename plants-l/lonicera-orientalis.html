                    <h1>Lonicera orientalis</h1>
<p>Lonicera orientalis, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in early summer. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The berries that follow the flowers are orange-red and contain seeds, which can spread the plant further.</p>
