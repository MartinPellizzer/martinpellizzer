                    <h1>Loranthus amblyphyllus</h1>
<p>Loranthus amblyphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds and facilitate dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
