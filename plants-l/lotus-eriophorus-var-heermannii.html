                    <h1>Lotus eriophorus var. heermannii</h1>
<p>Lotus eriophorus var. heermannii, commonly known as the Heermann's lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots extending into the substrate. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and water pollution, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
