                <h1>Lophiolepis ciliata</h1>
<p>Lophiolepis ciliata, commonly known as the silky lichen or the velvet lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique combination of fungal and algal components.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance due to the presence of a thick, leathery cortex. The thallus of Lophiolepis ciliata is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, velvety texture that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on tree bark or rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is known for its chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
