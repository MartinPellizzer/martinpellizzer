                    <h1>Loranthus salignus</h1>
<p>Loranthus salignus, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leafy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces small, white or yellowish berries that are a food source for various birds and animals.</p>
<p>Loranthus salignus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
