<p>Ledum glandulosum subsp.</p>
<p>columbianum, commonly known as the Pacific rosebay, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has dark green, leathery leaves with a waxy coating, which help it retain moisture in its often harsh, alpine or coastal habitats. It produces small, reddish-brown berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas.</p>
