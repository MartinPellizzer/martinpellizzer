                <h1>Loranthus spirostylis</h1>
<p>Loranthus spirostylis, commonly known as the spiral-styled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains adhesive seeds, aiding in its dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus spirostylis is native to Australia and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
