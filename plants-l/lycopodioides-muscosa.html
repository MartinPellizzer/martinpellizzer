<p>Lycopodioides muscosa, commonly known as the moss-like lycopod, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family, characterized by its small, spore-bearing structures.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocks. The plant has a simple morphology, consisting of a stem with whorled leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the apex of the stem and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Lycopodioides muscosa plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
