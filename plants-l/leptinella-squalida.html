<p>Leptinella squalida, commonly known as the squalid leaptinella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
