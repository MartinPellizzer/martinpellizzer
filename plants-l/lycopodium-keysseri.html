<p>Lycopodium keysseri, commonly known as the Keyser's clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of microphylls, which are small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
