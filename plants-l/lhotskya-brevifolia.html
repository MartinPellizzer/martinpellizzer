<p>Lhotskya brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, crustose growth form and is typically found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale to dark gray, and it may develop a powdery coating of soredia, which aids in reproduction. It is widely distributed across regions with suitable substrates, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
