<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it one of the tallest species in the Lobelia genus. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
