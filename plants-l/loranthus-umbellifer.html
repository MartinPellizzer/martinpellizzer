                    <h1>Loranthus umbellifer</h1>
<p>Loranthus umbellifer, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it receives. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels, giving it its scientific name. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees when birds consume them.</p>
<p>This parasitic relationship can have both positive and negative effects on the host tree's health and ecosystem.</p>
