                    <h1>Loranthus nigrescens</h1>
<p>Loranthus nigrescens, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its berries are typically black or dark red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus nigrescens plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
