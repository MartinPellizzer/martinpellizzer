                    <h1>Lycopodium alpinum f. umbrosum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium alpinum f. umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a fern species characterized by its dark, almost black fronds that thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to mountainous regions of Europe. The plant features small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, a typical trait of lycophytes. Its unique coloration helps it absorb more light in low-light conditions, making it well-adapted to its habitat.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in rocky soils and is a distinctive addition to woodland and alpine ecosystems.</p>
