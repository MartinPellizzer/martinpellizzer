                    <h1>Loranthus pulverulentus</h1>
<p>Loranthus pulverulentus, commonly known as the dusty mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if not managed properly.</p>
