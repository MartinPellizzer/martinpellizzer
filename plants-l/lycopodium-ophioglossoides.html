                    <h1>Lycopodium ophioglossoides</h1>
<p>Lycopodium ophioglossoides, commonly known as the zigzag clubmoss, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a unique, fern-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, often growing close to the ground.</p>
<p>Lycopodium ophioglossoides is an important component of ancient plant lineages, offering insights into the evolution of early vascular plants.</p>
