                    <h1>Loranthus flexistylus</h1>
<p>Loranthus flexistylus, commonly known as the flexible mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some photosynthetic capability through its own leaves. This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on the branches of eucalyptus and other hardwood trees. Its small, fleshy leaves and white or yellowish flowers make it visually distinct.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
