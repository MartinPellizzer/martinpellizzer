                    <h1>Lindera fragrans var. linearifolia</h1>
<p>Lindera fragrans var. linearifolia, commonly known as the fragrant lindera or narrow-leaved lindera, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite, and lance-shaped leaves that emit a subtle, spicy fragrance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is often distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Lindera fragrans.</p>
