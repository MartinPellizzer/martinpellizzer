<p>Lathyrus sativus var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated grass pea, is a variant of the grass pea plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, which features a mix of green, white, and sometimes yellow patterns on the leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, like its parent species, it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful if consumed in large quantities.</p>
