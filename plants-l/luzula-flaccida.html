                    <h1>Luzula flaccida</h1>
<p>Luzula flaccida, commonly known as the drooping woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers in early to mid-summer.</p>
<p>Luzula flaccida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing ground cover.</p>
