                    <h1>Loranthus puniceus</h1>
<p>Loranthus puniceus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some photosynthetic capability from its own leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that contain viscin, a sticky substance that aids in seed attachment to the host. It is native to Australia and is often found in forested areas, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Its presence can impact the health of its host trees, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even mortality in severe cases.</p>
