                    <h1>Lolium × elongatum</h1>
<p>Lolium × elongatum, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its erect growth habit and coarse, dark green foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa but has been widely introduced to other regions for forage and turfgrass purposes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–100 cm and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to form dense, persistent sods, making it highly competitive in various soil types.</p>
<p>Lolium × elongatum is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, which contributes to its widespread use in agriculture and landscaping.</p>
