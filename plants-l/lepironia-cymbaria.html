<p>Lepironia cymbaria, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Lepironia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it in muddy substrates while its stems float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Lepironia cymbaria plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
