<p>Leontopodium villosum, commonly known as the "Edelweiss," is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage and showy, yellow-centered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments where it forms compact, cushion-like growths. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and alpine beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also a protected species in many regions.</p>
