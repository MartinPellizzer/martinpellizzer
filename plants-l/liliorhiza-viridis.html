<p>Liliorhiza viridis, commonly known as the green water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the morning. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates in still or slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>Liliorhiza viridis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
