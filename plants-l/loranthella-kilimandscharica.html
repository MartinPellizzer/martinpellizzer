                    <h1>Loranthella kilimandscharica</h1>
<p>Loranthella kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant found in the high-altitude forests of East Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily members of the Euphorbiaceae family, through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can perform photosynthesis to some extent. Its small, white or greenish flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that attract birds for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
