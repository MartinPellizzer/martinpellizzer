<p>Leptocarpus brachiatus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, palmate leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline, often in brackish or saltwater environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations to coastal conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
