<p>Lunania sauvallei, commonly known as the moonflower of the southern seas, is a rare and enchanting flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and thrives in moist, well-drained soil near the shoreline. Its unique blooming pattern, which occurs only during the full moon, has made it a subject of fascination in both botanical and cultural studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, conservation efforts are underway to protect this delicate species.</p>
