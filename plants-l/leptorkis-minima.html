<p>Leptorkis minima, commonly known as the small-leaved leptorkis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
