                    <h1>Loxogramme avalanchia</h1>
<p>Loxogramme avalanchia, commonly known as the avalanche water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to the high-altitude streams of the Andes.</p>
<p>It possesses delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, rounded segments, resembling a cloverleaf. The plant thrives in cold, clear waters and requires specific mineral-rich conditions to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
