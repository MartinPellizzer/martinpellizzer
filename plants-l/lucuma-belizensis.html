                    <h1>Lucuma belizensis</h1>
<p>Lucuma belizensis, commonly known as the Belize lucuma, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Belize.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to the more well-known lucuma, but with a distinct flavor profile. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range.</p>
