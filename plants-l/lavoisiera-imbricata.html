<p>Lavoisiera imbricata, commonly known as the creeping lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens in regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>
