                    <h1>Lophophyllum bicristata</h1>
<p>Lophophyllum bicristata, commonly known as the double-crowned lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive two-layered thallus structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, temperate regions, forming a dense, crust-like growth. The plant's surface is covered with a layer of symbiotic algae, which provides the primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis. Its color ranges from pale green to yellowish-brown, depending on the environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Lophophyllum bicristata plays a vital role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
