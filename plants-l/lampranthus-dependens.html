<p>Lampranthus dependens, commonly known as the hanging ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
