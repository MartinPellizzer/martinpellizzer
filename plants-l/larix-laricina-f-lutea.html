                    <h1>Larix laricina f. lutea</h1>
<p>Larix laricina f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow larch, is a unique variant of the tamarack tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden foliage, which turns a vivid yellow in the fall. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical larch, with shorter, more densely packed branches. The cones are similar to those of other larch species, maturing to a brownish color.</p>
<p>It is native to North America and thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in boreal and subarctic regions.</p>
