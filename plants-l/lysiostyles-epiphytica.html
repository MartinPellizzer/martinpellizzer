                    <h1>Lysiostyles epiphytica</h1>
<p>Lysiostyles epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic lysiostyle, is a rare orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
