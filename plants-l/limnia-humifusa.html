                    <h1>Limnia humifusa</h1>
<p>Limnia humifusa, commonly known as the marsh willow or swamp willow, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to waterlogged soils, often found along stream banks, marshes, and pond edges. The plant has slender, willow-like stems that are often prostrate or creeping, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are inconspicuous and appear in clusters, contributing to its role in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Limnia humifusa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
