                    <h1>Loranthus sessilis</h1>
<p>Loranthus sessilis, commonly known as the sessile mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to a host tree, primarily from the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Loranthus sessilis plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
