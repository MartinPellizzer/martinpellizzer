<p>Lobivia korethroides, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in the spring. Lobivia korethroides is a slow-growing plant that prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
