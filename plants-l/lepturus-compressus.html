                    <h1>Lepturus compressus</h1>
<p>Lepturus compressus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its closely packed, leaf-like thallus with a dark green to brownish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis and decomposition. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator of air quality and ecological health.</p>
