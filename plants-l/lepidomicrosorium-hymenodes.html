<p>Lepidomicrosorium hymenodes, commonly known as the golden moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright golden-green coloration, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll and carotenoids. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, and it produces sporophytes with a capsule that releases spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Lepidomicrosorium hymenodes is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticultural settings.</p>
