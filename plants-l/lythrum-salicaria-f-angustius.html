                    <h1>Lythrum salicaria f. angustius</h1>
<p>Lythrum salicaria f. angustius, commonly known as narrowleaf purple loosestrife, is a botanical variant of the common purple loosestrife.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of violet flowers that bloom in summer. This plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to North America, where it can become invasive in wetland habitats. It thrives in moist soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation make it a significant ecological concern in certain regions.</p>
