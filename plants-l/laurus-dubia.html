<p>Laurus dubia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the more well-known Laurus nobilis.

It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic leaves, it has been used historically in perfumery and as a culinary herb in certain traditional cuisines.</p>
