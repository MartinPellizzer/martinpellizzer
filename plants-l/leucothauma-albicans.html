                    <h1>Leucothauma albicans</h1>
<p>Leucothauma albicans, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, humid environments. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly specialized and difficult to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
