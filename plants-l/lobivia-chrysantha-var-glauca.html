                    <h1>Lobivia chrysantha var. glauca</h1>
<p>Lobivia chrysantha var. glauca, commonly known as the Blue Ghost Lobivia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, silver-blue to gray-green pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
