                    <h1>Lophiolepis pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Lophiolepis pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid leaf cycad, is a species native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a subtropical to tropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
