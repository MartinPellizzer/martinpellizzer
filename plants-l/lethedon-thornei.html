                    <h1>Lethedon thornei</h1>
<p>Lethedon thornei, commonly known as the thorny lethedon, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, reducing water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lethedon thornei is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
