<p>It features striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. Its root system is adapted to tolerate brackish water and sandy soils, making it resilient to coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and hardy nature.</p>
