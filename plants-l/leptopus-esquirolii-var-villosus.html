                    <h1>Leptopus esquirolii var. villosus</h1>
<p>Leptopus esquirolii var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy leathery lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, velvety texture and dark green to blackish upper surface.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. The thallus is composed of a complex interweaving of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form a symbiotic relationship. Its distinctive hairy appearance is due to the presence of fine, branched structures called rhizines.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
