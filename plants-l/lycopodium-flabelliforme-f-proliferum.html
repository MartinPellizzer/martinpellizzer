                    <h1>Lycopodium flabelliforme f. proliferum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium flabelliforme f. proliferum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its small, scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
