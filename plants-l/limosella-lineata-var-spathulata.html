                    <h1>Limosella lineata var. spathulata</h1>
<p>Limosella lineata var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandspoon, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically broad and spatulate in shape, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and its ornamental appeal in sandy garden settings.</p>
