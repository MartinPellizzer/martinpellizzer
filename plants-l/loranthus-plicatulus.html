                    <h1>Loranthus plicatulus</h1>
<p>Loranthus plicatulus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus plicatulus is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
