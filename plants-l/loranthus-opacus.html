                    <h1>Loranthus opacus</h1>
<p>Loranthus opacus, commonly known as the obscure mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light that penetrates the host's canopy. The plant's small, white or greenish flowers are typically visited by insects, facilitating pollination. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus opacus plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for wildlife and influencing the growth of its host trees.</p>
