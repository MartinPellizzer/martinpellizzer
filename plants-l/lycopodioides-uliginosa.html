                    <h1>Lycopodioides uliginosa</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides uliginosa, commonly known as the bog huperzia, is a species of clubmoss that thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodioides uliginosa plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within peatland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates a stable, undisturbed habitat with consistent moisture levels.</p>
