                    <h1>Lagenocarpus strictus var. leptocladius</h1>
<p>Lagenocarpus strictus var. leptocladius, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
