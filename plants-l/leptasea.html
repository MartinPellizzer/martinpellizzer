<p>Leptasea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Leptasea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia.</p>
