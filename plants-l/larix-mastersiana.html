                    <h1>Larix mastersiana</h1>
<p>Larix mastersiana, commonly known as the Masters' larch, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the pine family (Pinaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive needle-like leaves that turn golden in the fall. The tree typically grows in cold, high-altitude environments where it forms dense, wind-resistant forests. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, the species is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
