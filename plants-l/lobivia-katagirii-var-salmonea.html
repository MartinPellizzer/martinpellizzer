<p>Lobivia katagirii var. salmonea, commonly known as the salmon-pink lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that turn pinkish-red at the edges when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of vibrant pink to salmon-colored flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and requiring minimal watering.</p>
<p>Due to its striking coloration and compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
