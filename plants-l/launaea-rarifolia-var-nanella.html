                    <h1>Launaea rarifolia var. nanella</h1>
<p>Launaea rarifolia var. nanella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved launaea, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its sparsely leafed, cylindrical stems that store water, adapting to drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Launaea rarifolia var. nanella is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
