                    <h1>Loranthus dioicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus dioicus, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, scale-like leaves and white, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves both asexual and sexual reproduction, with seeds dispersed by birds that eat the berries.</p>
