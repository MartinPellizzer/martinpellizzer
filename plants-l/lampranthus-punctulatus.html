<p>Lampranthus punctulatus, commonly known as the spotted ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>
