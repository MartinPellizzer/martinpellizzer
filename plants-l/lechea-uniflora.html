                    <h1>Lechea uniflora</h1>
<p>Lechea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains latex and is toxic to some animals.</p>
<p>Lechea uniflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly certain species of beetles and moths.</p>
