                    <h1>Lobivia calochlora</h1>
<p>Lobivia calochlora, commonly known as the Orange-Fringed Lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, branching stems that are often ribbed and covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Lobivia calochlora is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
