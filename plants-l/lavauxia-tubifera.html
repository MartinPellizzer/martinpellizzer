<p>Lavauxia tubifera, commonly known as the tuberous lichen, is a unique plant that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, which is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is characterized by its crust-like growth form, often forming dense, flat thalli on rocks and soil surfaces. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in regions with low moisture and high sunlight exposure.</p>
