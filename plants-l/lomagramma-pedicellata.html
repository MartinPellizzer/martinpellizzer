                    <h1>Lomagramma pedicellata</h1>
<p>Lomagramma pedicellata, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that often grow close to the ground. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Lomagramma pedicellata is often found in forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions.</p>
