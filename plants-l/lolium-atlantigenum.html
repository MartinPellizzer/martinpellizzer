                    <h1>Lolium atlantigenum</h1>
<p>Lolium atlantigenum, commonly known as the Atlantic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal soils, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
