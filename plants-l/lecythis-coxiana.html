                    <h1>Lecythis coxiana</h1>
<p>Lecythis coxiana, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces a heavy, aromatic fruit that splits open to reveal seeds surrounded by a sticky, resinous pulp. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich, golden color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
