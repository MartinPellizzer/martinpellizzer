                    <h1>Lobivia lateritia var. rubriflora</h1>
<p>Lobivia lateritia var. rubriflora, commonly known as the Red-flowered Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers during the spring and summer months, adding visual interest to its otherwise muted foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for container gardening and requires minimal maintenance.</p>
