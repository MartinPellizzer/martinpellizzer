                    <h1>Loranthus dombeyae</h1>
<p>Loranthus dombeyae, commonly known as the Dombey's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the tropics and subtropics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients directly from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds, which then disperse the seeds.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in forest ecosystems.</p>
