<p>Ligusticopsis modesta, commonly known as the modest ligustic, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range.</p>
