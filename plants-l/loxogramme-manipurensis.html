<p>Loxogramme manipurensis, commonly known as the Manipur water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to the northeastern region of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, linear pinnae that help in maximizing light absorption for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and pollution.</p>
