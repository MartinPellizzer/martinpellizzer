                    <h1>Lophopyxis</h1>
<p>Lophopyxis, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees native to the southern Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cone shape and needle-like leaves that are often arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lophopyxis species are typically found in high-altitude regions, where they thrive in cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, many species within this genus are now considered endangered.</p>
