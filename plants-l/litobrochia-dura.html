                    <h1>Litobrochia dura</h1>
<p>Litobrochia dura, commonly known as the hard-stemmed brochidium, is a rare and resilient succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, spiky leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom during the rainy season and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Litobrochia dura is a subject of interest for botanists studying xerophytic plant survival strategies.</p>
