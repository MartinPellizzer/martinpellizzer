<p>Leucotrichum mortonii, commonly known as the Morton's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, often growing on the roots of trees. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
