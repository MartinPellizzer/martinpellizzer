<p>Lecaniodiscus fraxinifolius, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnate, with each leaflet being ovate and slightly serrated. The tree produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and showy flowers.</p>
