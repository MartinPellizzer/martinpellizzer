<p>Leptochloa virgata var. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>
