<p>Limnorchis brachypetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to freshwater wetlands.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, usually emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering pollutants.</p>
<p>Limnorchis brachypetala plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and supporting biodiversity.</p>
