                    <h1>Leptogramma burksiorum</h1>
<p>Leptogramma burksiorum, commonly known as the Burks' leptogramma, is a rare and unique fern native to specific regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Leptogramma burksiorum is considered an important indicator species for undisturbed, mature forests.</p>
