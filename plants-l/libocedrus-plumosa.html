                    <h1>Libocedrus plumosa</h1>
<p>Libocedrus plumosa, commonly known as the silver fir or mountain fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a waxy coating. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to fire and pests.</p>
<p>Libocedrus plumosa is often found in high-elevation forests, where it plays a key role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>
