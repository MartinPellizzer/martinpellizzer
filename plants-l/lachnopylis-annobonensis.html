                    <h1>Lachnopylis annobonensis</h1>
<p>Lachnopylis annobonensis, commonly known as the Annobon Island lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily on the island of Annob√≥n in the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lachnaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to its substrate. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Lachnopylis annobonensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in protecting its fragile ecosystem.</p>
