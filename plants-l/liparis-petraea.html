<p>Liparis petraea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to rocky and mountainous regions in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a single, erect flower that is typically greenish-yellow with purple or brown markings. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in crevices, allowing it to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Liparis petraea is a perennial species that blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
