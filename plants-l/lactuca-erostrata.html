                    <h1>Lactuca erostrata</h1>
<p>Lactuca erostrata, commonly known as the bitterleaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, temperate environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves with a distinctive bitter taste, which is due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones. Its flowering heads consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray florets.</p>
<p>Lactuca erostrata is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
