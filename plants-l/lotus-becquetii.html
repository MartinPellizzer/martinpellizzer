                    <h1>Lotus becquetii</h1>
<p>Lotus becquetii, commonly known as the African lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its rhizomes grow underwater, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the sediment.</p>
<p>Lotus becquetii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
