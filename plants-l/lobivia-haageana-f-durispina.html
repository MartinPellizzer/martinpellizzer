                    <h1>Lobivia haageana f. durispina</h1>
<p>Lobivia haageana f. durispina, commonly known as the Spiny Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It features a rounded, ribbed stem that is typically covered in spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its unique morphology and resilience.</p>
