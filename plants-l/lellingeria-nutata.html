                    <h1>Lellingeria nutata</h1>
<p>Lellingeria nutata, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers that are similar in appearance to those of the common dandelion, though they are typically smaller. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Lellingeria nutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes.</p>
