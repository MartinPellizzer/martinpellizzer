                    <h1>Lachnaea glauca</h1>
<p>Lachnaea glauca, commonly known as the blue lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a distinct botanical structure composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically forms a crust-like growth on rocks, bark, or soil surfaces, displaying a bluish-green color due to the presence of the algal partner. The thallus is generally thin and loosely attached, with a granular or powdery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is notable for its role in ecological succession and as an indicator of air quality.</p>
