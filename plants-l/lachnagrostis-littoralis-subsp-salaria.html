<p>salaria, commonly known as saltmarsh grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and tidal environments, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels contributes to its ecological significance in estuarine habitats.</p>
