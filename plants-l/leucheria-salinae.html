                    <h1>Leucheria salinae</h1>
<p>Leucheria salinae, commonly known as the salt marsh lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces or soil. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and contributing to nutrient cycling in salt marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in coastal regions where it tolerates high salinity and fluctuating moisture levels.</p>
