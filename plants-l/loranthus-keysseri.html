                    <h1>Loranthus keysseri</h1>
<p>Loranthus keysseri, commonly known as the Kessie's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to parts of Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually scale-like and lack true stomata, which is a characteristic feature of many mistletoe species.</p>
<p>Loranthus keysseri plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
