                    <h1>Loranthus loandensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus loandensis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>Loranthus loandensis is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
