<p>Lonchocarpus scorpioides, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, spiny pods. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its bark and roots, which have been used in traditional medicine but require caution. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various insects and contributing to soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
