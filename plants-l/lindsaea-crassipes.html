<p>Lindsaea crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the canopies of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Lindsaea crassipes plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to the understory vegetation and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
