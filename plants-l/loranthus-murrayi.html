<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Australia and New Guinea. The plant produces small, green leaves and is often found in coastal and tropical rainforest environments. It relies on its host for water and nutrients, while providing no direct benefit to the host.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
