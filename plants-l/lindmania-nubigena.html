<p>Lindmania nubigena, commonly known as the cloud forest fern, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that thrive in the cool, moist environments of cloud forests. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid conditions, often found on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Lindmania nubigena is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
