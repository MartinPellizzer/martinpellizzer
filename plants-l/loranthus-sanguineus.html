                    <h1>Loranthus sanguineus</h1>
<p>Loranthus sanguineus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Terminalia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves and produces red berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
