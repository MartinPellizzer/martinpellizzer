                    <h1>Loranthus terniflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus terniflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in threes, giving it its specific epithet *terniflorus*. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Africa and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats.</p>
