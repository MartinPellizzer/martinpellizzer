<p>Lecanopteris deparioides, commonly known as the false huperzia, is a fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pinnately divided, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically glossy and have a delicate, fern-like appearance, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
