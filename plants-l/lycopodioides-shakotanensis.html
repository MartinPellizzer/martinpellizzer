<p>Lycopodioides shakotanensis, commonly known as the Shakotan clubmoss, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the remote Shakotan Island in Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rocky crevices or on forest floors. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>This species plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its unique island ecosystem.</p>
