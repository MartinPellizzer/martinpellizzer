                <h1>Leochilus scriptus</h1>
<p>Leochilus scriptus, commonly known as the script lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Teloschistaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like thallus that is typically grayish-green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal component. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Leochilus scriptus is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
