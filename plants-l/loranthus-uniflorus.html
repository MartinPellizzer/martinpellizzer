                    <h1>Loranthus uniflorus</h1>
<p>Loranthus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the host's light exposure. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a smooth, waxy stem and a single, terminal flower that is often white or pale green. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various parts of Africa and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
