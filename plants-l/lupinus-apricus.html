                    <h1>Lupinus apricus</h1>
<p>Lupinus apricus, commonly known as the early lupin, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. Lupinus apricus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
