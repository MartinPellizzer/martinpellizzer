                    <h1>Loranthus hexapetalus</h1>
<p>Loranthus hexapetalus, commonly known as the six-petaled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which connect to the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
