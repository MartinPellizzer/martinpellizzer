                    <h1>Lecanium</h1>
<p>Lecanium, commonly known as the scale insect, is a type of hemipteran insect that belongs to the family Coccidae.</p>
<p>These insects are characterized by their small, soft bodies and their ability to secrete a waxy substance that protects them from predators and environmental stress. Lecanium species are often found on the stems, leaves, and branches of various plants, where they feed on plant sap using their piercing-sucking mouthparts. They are considered pests in many agricultural and horticultural settings due to the damage they cause to host plants.</p>
<p>Some species are also known to produce honeydew, which can lead to the growth of sooty mold on the plant surfaces.</p>
