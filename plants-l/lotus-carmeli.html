<p>Lotus carmeli, commonly known as the Carmel lotus, is a rare and striking aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of Israel.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater lakes and ponds. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays an important role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Lotus carmeli is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
