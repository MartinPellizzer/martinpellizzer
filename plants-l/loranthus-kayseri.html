                    <h1>Loranthus kayseri</h1>
<p>Loranthus kayseri, commonly known as the Turkish mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus kayseri plays a role in ecological interactions, influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
