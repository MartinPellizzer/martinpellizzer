                    <h1>Ludovia</h1>
<p>Ludovia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ludovia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal contribute to its use in both horticulture and traditional medicine.</p>
