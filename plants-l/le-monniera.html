                    <h1>Le-monniera</h1>
<p>Le-monniera, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a flowering plant native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Le-monniera is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, Helleborus niger, reflects its historical association with funerary rites due to its dark, almost funeral-like appearance.</p>
