The plant is native to specific alpine regions in Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
