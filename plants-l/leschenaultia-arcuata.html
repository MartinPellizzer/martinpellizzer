                    <h1>Leschenaultia arcuata</h1>
<p>Leschenaultia arcuata, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Central Asia and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. Leschenaultia arcuata is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
