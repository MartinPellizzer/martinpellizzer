                    <h1>Lathraea squamaria var. erecta</h1>
<p>Lathraea squamaria var. erecta, commonly known as the erect lousewort, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized root system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are scale-like, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
