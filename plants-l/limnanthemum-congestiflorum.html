                    <h1>Limnanthemum congestiflorum</h1>
<p>Limnanthemum congestiflorum, commonly known as the clustered water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
