<p>Limbarda crithmoides subsp.</p>
<p>longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its blue to violet flowers and silver-blue foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
