                    <h1>Loranthus europaeus</h1>
<p>Loranthus europaeus, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem, which is embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, green leaves and white or pink berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of sticky seeds by birds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>Loranthus europaeus is often associated with festive traditions and has cultural significance in various European regions.</p>
