                    <h1>Leymus regelii</h1>
<p>Leymus regelii, commonly known as desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Leymus regelii is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in desert ecosystems.</p>
