                    <h1>Lolium temulentum f. leve</h1>
<p>Lolium temulentum f. leve, commonly known as the slender ryegrass, is a variant of the annual ryegrass species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form. The plant produces spikelets that are usually arranged in a single row along the stem, with lemmas that are often hairy. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This form is less commonly cultivated than other ryegrass varieties but is still used in some forage systems.</p>
