                    <h1>Leymus racemosus var. crassinervius</h1>
<p>Leymus racemosus var. crassinervius, commonly known as the broad-veined wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with prominent, parallel veins. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to form extensive sods, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
