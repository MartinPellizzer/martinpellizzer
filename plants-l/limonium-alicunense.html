<p>Limonium alicunense, commonly known as the Alcudon wildflower, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium alicunense thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is primarily appreciated for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
