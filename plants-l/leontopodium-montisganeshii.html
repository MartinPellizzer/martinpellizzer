                    <h1>Leontopodium montisganeshii</h1>
<p>Leontopodium montisganeshii, commonly known as the Ganesh Mountain edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround its small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils. Its unique morphology, including the fuzzy covering and rosette growth form, helps it withstand harsh mountain climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
