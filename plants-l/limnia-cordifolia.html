                    <h1>Limnia cordifolia</h1>
<p>Limnia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf water plant, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, branching stems that help it spread across the water surface. Its leaves are usually bright green and float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Limnia cordifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
