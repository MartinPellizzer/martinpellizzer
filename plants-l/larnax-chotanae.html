<p>Larnax chotanae, commonly known as the Chotana larnax, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Larnax chotanae is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation.</p>
