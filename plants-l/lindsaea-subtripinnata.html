                    <h1>Lindsaea subtripinnata</h1>
<p>Lindsaea subtripinnata, commonly known as the three-branched maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and capable of producing new growth from nodes along their length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Lindsaea subtripinnata thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
