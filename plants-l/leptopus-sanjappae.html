                    <h1>Leptopus sanjappae</h1>
<p>Leptopus sanjappae, commonly known as the Sanjappa's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, elongated floral structure that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptopus sanjappae is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
