                    <h1>Lithops francisci</h1>
<p>Lithops francisci, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "living stone," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant's flowers, which appear in late spring, are typically yellow or orange and are borne on tall, slender stems. Lithops francisci has a unique ability to photosynthesize through its leaves, which are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
