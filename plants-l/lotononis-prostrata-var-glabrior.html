                    <h1>Lotononis prostrata var. glabrior</h1>
<p>Lotononis prostrata var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth lotononis, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, though the 'glabrior' variety has fewer hairs, giving it a smoother appearance. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters during the cooler months, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in some regions as a hardy garden plant.</p>
