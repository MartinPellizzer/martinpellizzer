                    <h1>Loudonia</h1>
<p>Loudonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, white, orchid-like flowers and lacks leaves, relying entirely on its roots for sustenance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its delicate structure and limited habitat make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this rare botanical species.</p>
