                    <h1>Lotus bouteloui</h1>
<p>Lotus bouteloui, commonly known as the desert lotus, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, white pubescence that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Lotus bouteloui is adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and ecologically important species in its habitat.</p>
