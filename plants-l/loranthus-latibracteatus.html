                    <h1>Loranthus latibracteatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus latibracteatus, commonly known as the broad-bract mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized root structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Santalales order and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including India and China. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its berries, which are often red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various animals and contributing to the nutrient cycle of the forest ecosystem.</p>
