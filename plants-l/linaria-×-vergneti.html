                    <h1>Linaria × vergneti</h1>
<p>Linaria × vergneti, commonly known as the hybrid everlasting or hybrid toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Linaria vulgaris and Linaria daphnifolia, resulting in a perennial herb with distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces numerous small, slender seed pods that release seeds through a mechanism similar to a catapult, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
