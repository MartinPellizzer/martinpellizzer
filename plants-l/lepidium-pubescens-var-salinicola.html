                    <h1>Lepidium pubescens var. salinicola</h1>
<p>Lepidium pubescens var. salinicola, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats across North America.</p>
