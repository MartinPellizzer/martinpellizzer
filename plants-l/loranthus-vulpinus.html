                    <h1>Loranthus vulpinus</h1>
<p>Loranthus vulpinus, commonly known as the dogwood dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host trees, primarily members of the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host plants, affecting their growth and health.</p>
