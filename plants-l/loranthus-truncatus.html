                    <h1>Loranthus truncatus</h1>
<p>Loranthus truncatus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are a source of food for birds and other animals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Loranthus truncatus plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing habitat for various species.</p>
