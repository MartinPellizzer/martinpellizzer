<p>Lycopodioides tarapotensis, commonly known as the Peruvian clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species of lycopod found in the Andean highlands of Peru.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that grows in moist, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cones.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to extinction.</p>
