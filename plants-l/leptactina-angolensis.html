                    <h1>Leptactina angolensis</h1>
<p>Leptactina angolensis, commonly known as the Angola liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Ptygantheraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically flat and ribbon-like in appearance. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate moisture. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized clusters and aid in vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Leptactina angolensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
