<p>Loudetia flavida, commonly known as the yellow marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Loudetia flavida is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
