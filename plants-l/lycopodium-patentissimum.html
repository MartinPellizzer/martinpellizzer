                    <h1>Lycopodium patentissimum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium patentissimum, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a spore-bearing cone at the tip of its stem. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Lycopodium patentissimum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of ancient plant groups.</p>
<p>Its structure reflects evolutionary adaptations from early land plants, showcasing features of both ferns and modern vascular plants.</p>
