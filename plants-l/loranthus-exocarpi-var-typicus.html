                    <h1>Loranthus exocarpi var. typicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus exocarpi var. typicus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, and its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds. It is native to regions of South and Southeast Asia, including India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
