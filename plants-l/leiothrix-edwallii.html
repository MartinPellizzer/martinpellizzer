<p>Leiothrix edwallii, commonly known as the Edwall's leiothrix, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a slightly serrated margin, and the plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with limited cultivation outside its native range.</p>
