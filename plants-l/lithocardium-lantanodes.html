                    <h1>Lithocardium lantanodes</h1>
<p>Lithocardium lantanodes, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, and it contains a variety of secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role. This lichen is often found on exposed rock faces and is an indicator of low-nutrient, dry habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and climatic studies.</p>
