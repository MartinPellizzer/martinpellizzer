                    <h1>Lobivia haematantha var. elongata</h1>
<p>Lobivia haematantha var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated stonecress, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
