                    <h1>Lathyrus bijugatus var. sandbergii</h1>
<p>Lathyrus bijugatus var. sandbergii, commonly known as the Sandberg's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with two pairs of leaflets and a terminal bud, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
