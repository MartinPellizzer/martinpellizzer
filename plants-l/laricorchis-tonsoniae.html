<p>Laricorchis tonsoniae, commonly known as the Tonson's tassel orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
