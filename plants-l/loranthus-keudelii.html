                    <h1>Loranthus keudelii</h1>
<p>Loranthus keudelii, commonly known as the Keudel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, leafy structure that can cover significant portions of the host's canopy. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus keudelii plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
