Native to regions across Africa, it thrives in humid, shaded environments along riverbanks and forests. Its vibrant blooms, often in shades of yellow and orange, attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in local healing practices.
