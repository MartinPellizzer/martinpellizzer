<p>Luzula banksiana var. rhadina, commonly known as the silver woodrush, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms low, compact clumps. The leaves are typically silver-gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, arranged in spike-like clusters.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
