<p>Leptocereus weingartianus, commonly known as the Weingartian night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, slender stems and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting.</p>
<p>Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a striking and rare addition to desert ecosystems.</p>
