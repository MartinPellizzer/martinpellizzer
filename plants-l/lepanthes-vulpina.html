                    <h1>Lepanthes vulpina</h1>
<p>Lepanthes vulpina, commonly known as the fox orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, often hairy stem and a single, showy flower that typically features a dark purple or reddish hue. The plant produces a small, greenish or yellowish ovary that matures into a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. Lepanthes vulpina thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Its intricate floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
