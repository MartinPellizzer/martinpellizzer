<p>Liparis paludigena, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in northern regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it an important indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
