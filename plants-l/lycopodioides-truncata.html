                    <h1>Lycopodioides truncata</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides truncata, commonly known as the forked clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and needle-like leaves that are often twisted or spirally arranged. The plant produces sporangia in small, clustered structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Lycopodioides truncata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
