<p>Livistona hasseltii, commonly known as the bamboo palm, is a species of cycad native to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials in indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Livistona hasseltii thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas.</p>
