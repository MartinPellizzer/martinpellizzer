                    <h1>Liparis phalacrocorax</h1>
<p>Liparis phalacrocorax, commonly known as the black-cormed orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, corm-like rhizomes and its striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
