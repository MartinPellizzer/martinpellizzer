<p>Lotodes bituminosum, commonly known as the bituminous water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are small and yellow, emerging from the water surface, and it produces distinctive, oily seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
