                    <h1>Limnorchis aquilonis</h1>
<p>Limnorchis aquilonis, commonly known as the aquatic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its delicate, water-adapted structure. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters where it can anchor itself to submerged substrates. Its leaves are elongated and ribbon-like, adapted for buoyancy and photosynthesis in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Limnorchis aquilonis is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality.</p>
