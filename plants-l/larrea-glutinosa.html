                    <h1>Larrea glutinosa</h1>
<p>Larrea glutinosa, commonly known as greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its resinous sap gives it a sticky texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Larrea glutinosa is often found in disturbed soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
