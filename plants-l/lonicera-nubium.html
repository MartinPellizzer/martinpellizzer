                    <h1>Lonicera nubium</h1>
<p>Lonicera nubium, commonly known as the cloud honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly favored by humans. Lonicera nubium thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rocky or woodland gardens.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
