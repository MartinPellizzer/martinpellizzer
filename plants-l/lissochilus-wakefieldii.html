The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species within its ecosystem.</p>
