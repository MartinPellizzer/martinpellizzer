<p>Loxogramme yakushimae, commonly known as the Yakushiman fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lindsaeaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
