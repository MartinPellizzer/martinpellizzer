                    <h1>Loranthus elmeri</h1>
<p>Loranthus elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees are abundant.</p>
