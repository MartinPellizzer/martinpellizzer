                    <h1>Limniris humilis</h1>
<p>Limniris humilis, commonly known as the small marsh gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>Limniris humilis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species.</p>
