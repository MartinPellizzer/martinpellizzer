                    <h1>Larix leptolepis</h1>
<p>Larix leptolepis, commonly known as Japanese larch, is a deciduous conifer native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to shed its needle-like leaves in the fall. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is light, soft, and resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and crafts.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
