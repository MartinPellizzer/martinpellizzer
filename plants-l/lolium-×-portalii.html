                    <h1>Lolium × portalii</h1>
<p>Lolium × portalii, commonly known as the hybrid ryegrass, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Festuca arundinacea (timothy grass).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits, combining features of both parent species. The plant typically exhibits a tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, making it reliant on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
<p>It is often used in forage production and turfgrass research due to its adaptability and genetic diversity.</p>
