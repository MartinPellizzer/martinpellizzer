                    <h1>Lepisiphon</h1>
<p>Lepisiphon, commonly known as the "water bean," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habits, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. They typically have slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or white in color. The leaves are usually narrow and arranged alternately along the stem, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Lepisiphon species are often used in wetland restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
