                    <h1>Lecanopteris annabellae</h1>
<p>Lecanopteris annabellae, commonly known as the Annabell's water fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lecanopteris annabellae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
