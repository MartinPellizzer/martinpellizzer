                    <h1>Lecanopteris sarcopus</h1>
<p>Lecanopteris sarcopus, commonly known as the rock brake, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in humid forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
