                    <h1>Loranthus bifurcatus var. typicus</h1>
<p>Loranthus bifurcatus var. typicus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red, contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating propagation.</p>
<p>This species is widely distributed across Australia and is an important part of the ecological dynamics in its native habitat.</p>
