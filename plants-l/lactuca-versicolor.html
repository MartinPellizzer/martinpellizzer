<p>Lactuca versicolor, commonly known as the variable lettuce, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its variable leaf shapes and colors. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves can range from smooth to hairy. Lactuca versicolor is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
<p>Its name comes from the Latin word "lactus," meaning milk, due to the milky sap it exudes when damaged.</p>
