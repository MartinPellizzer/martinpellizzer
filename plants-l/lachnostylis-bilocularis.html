<p>Lachnostylis bilocularis, commonly known as the two-chambered lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leaf-like thallus with a distinctive two-chambered structure in its upper cortex. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Lachnostylis bilocularis plays an important role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
