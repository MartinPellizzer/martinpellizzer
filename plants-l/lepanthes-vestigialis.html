<p>Lepanthes vestigialis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this epiphytic plant grows on trees and rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are typically small and strap-like, adapted to its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Lepanthes vestigialis is highly sought after in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
