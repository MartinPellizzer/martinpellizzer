                    <h1>Loranthus buchholzii</h1>
<p>Loranthus buchholzii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Terminalia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, often leading to reduced growth or even death of the host tree.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic lifestyle, Loranthus buchholzii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
