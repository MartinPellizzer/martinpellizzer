                    <h1>Lindernia viatica</h1>
<p>Lindernia viatica, commonly known as the stickyweed or velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, it can become invasive in some environments.</p>
