                    <h1>Lecanorchis seidenfadenii</h1>
<p>Lecanorchis seidenfadenii, commonly known as the Sunda ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
