<p>Lumnitzera littorea, commonly known as the mangrove button, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aerial roots, which help in anchoring the plant and facilitating gas exchange. The plant has small, simple leaves that are often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Lumnitzera littorea plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
