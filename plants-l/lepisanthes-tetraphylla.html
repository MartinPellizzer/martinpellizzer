<p>Lepisanthes tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leafed lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often with four petals, giving it its common name. The plant has strap-like, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Lepisanthes tetraphylla thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near the forest floor.</p>
