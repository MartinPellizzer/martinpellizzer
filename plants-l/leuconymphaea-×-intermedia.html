                    <h1>Leuconymphaea × intermedia</h1>
<p>Leuconymphaea × intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid water lily, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Leuconymphaea minor and Nymphaea tetragona.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the pond bottom while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The hybrid is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits.</p>
