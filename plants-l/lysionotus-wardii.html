<p>Lysionotus wardii, commonly known as the Ward's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lysionotus wardii is considered a threatened species.</p>
