                    <h1>Lithops christinae</h1>
<p>Lithops christinae, commonly known as the "Christina's ice plant," is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pair of fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble rocks, allowing it to blend seamlessly into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its thick, rounded leaves, which are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring.</p>
<p>Lithops christinae is well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions and requires minimal water to thrive.</p>
