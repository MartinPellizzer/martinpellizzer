                    <h1>Loranthus chrysanthoides</h1>
<p>Loranthus chrysanthoides, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its berries are red and contain sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
