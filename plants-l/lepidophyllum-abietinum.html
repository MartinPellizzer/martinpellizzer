                    <h1>Lepidophyllum abietinum</h1>
<p>Lepidophyllum abietinum, commonly known as the silverleaf cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with a dense covering of silver-gray, overlapping scales that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic habitats.</p>
