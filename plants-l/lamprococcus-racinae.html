                    <h1>Lamprococcus racinae</h1>
<p>Lamprococcus racinae, commonly known as the root lichen, is a unique organism that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal component and a cyanobacterial partner.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the surfaces of roots, particularly those of grasses and other low-growing plants. The plant-like structure of Lamprococcus racinae is actually a composite of both fungal and algal components, making it a lichen rather than a true plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments where it can absorb nutrients from the soil through its root substrate.</p>
<p>This organism plays a minor but ecologically significant role in nutrient cycling within its habitat.</p>
