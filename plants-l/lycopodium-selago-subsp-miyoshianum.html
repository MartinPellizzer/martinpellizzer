<p>Lycopodium selago subsp.</p>
<p>miyoshianum, commonly known as the Miyoshi lycopod, is a rare and small evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to specific regions in Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Its reproductive structures, known as strobili, are borne on the upper parts of the plant and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
