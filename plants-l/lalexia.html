                    <h1>Lalexia</h1>
<p>Lalexia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its bulbs. Lalexia produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
