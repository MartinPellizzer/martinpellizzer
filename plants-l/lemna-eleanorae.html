                    <h1>Lemna eleanorae</h1>
<p>Lemna eleanorae, commonly known as the Eleanor's duckweed, is a small, floating aquatic plant belonging to the Lemnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new fronds forming from the nodes of the parent plant. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can quickly colonize new areas, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions.</p>
