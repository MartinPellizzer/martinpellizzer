                    <h1>Ludwigia mollis</h1>
<p>Ludwigia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy green leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds due to its preference for moist soil. Ludwigia mollis is an annual herb that can grow up to 1 meter tall, with a sprawling habit that allows it to spread rapidly in suitable environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable wetland plant and a potential invasive species in non-native areas.</p>
