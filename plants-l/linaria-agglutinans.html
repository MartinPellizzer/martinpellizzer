<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, sticky seeds, which adhere to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Linaria agglutinans is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
