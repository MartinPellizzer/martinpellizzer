<p>Laserpitium latifolium subsp.</p>
<p>glabrum, commonly known as the broadleaf lasur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist, coastal habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and unique appearance, it is a valued plant in native plant gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
