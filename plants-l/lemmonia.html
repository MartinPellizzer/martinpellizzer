                    <h1>Lemmonia</h1>
<p>Lemmonia, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems adapted to store water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Lemmonia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
