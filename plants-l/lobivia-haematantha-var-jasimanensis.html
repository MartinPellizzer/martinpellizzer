<p>Lobivia haematantha var. jasimanensis, commonly known as the Jasimanensis Lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically small and spiny, providing additional protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
