                    <h1>Lithocnides</h1>
<p>Lithocnides, commonly known as rock lice, are small, herbaceous plants that thrive in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their compact growth habit and often have a mat-forming structure that helps them conserve moisture. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which reduces water loss. Lithocnides species are often found in coastal areas and dry mountain regions where they can tolerate harsh conditions.</p>
<p>These plants play a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in their native habitats.</p>
