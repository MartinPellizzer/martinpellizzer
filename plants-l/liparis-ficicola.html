<p>Liparis ficicola, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes that allow it to climb and attach to trees or other structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are elongated and often form a rosette at the base, aiding in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Liparis ficicola is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>
