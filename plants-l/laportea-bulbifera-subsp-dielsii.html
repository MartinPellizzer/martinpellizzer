<p>Laportea bulbifera subsp.</p>
<p>dielsii, commonly known as the bulbiferous false dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves and the production of bulbils along the stems, which can give rise to new plants.</p>

<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique reproductive strategy and ecological adaptations.</p>
