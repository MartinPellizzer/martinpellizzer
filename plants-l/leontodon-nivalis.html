<p>Leontodon nivalis, commonly known as the snow leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it withstands cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its flowering period is brief, often lasting only a few weeks, and it is pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>Leontodon nivalis is adapted to harsh mountain environments and is considered an indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
