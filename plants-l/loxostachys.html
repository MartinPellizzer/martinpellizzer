                    <h1>Loxostachys</h1>
<p>Loxostachys, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Mongolia and China. The plants are characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Loxostachys species often have deep root systems that help them access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in their native habitats.</p>
