                    <h1>Loranthus scurrula var. buddleioides</h1>
<p>Loranthus scurrula var. buddleioides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that facilitate bird dispersal. It is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
