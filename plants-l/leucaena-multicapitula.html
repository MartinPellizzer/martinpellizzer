                    <h1>Leucaena multicapitula</h1>
<p>Leucaena multicapitula, commonly known as the multibranched leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is often used for forage due to its high nutritional value for livestock. Leucaena multicapitula is also valued in agroforestry systems for its ability to fix nitrogen and its rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
