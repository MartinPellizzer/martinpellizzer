<p>Lythrum hyssopifolia var. virgultosum, commonly known as swamp sawroot, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base. The plant produces spikes of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other lythrum species but is distinguished by its unique habitat and floral characteristics.</p>
