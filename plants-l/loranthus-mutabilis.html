                    <h1>Loranthus mutabilis</h1>
<p>Loranthus mutabilis, commonly known as the variable mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is known for its variable appearance, which gives it its common name.</p>
