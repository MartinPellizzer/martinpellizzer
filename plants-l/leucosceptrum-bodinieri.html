The plant has slender, often arching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
