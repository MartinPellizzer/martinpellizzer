                    <h1>Loranthus rosaceus</h1>
<p>Loranthus rosaceus, commonly known as the rose mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It primarily grows on species of the genus Prunus, such as cherries and plums, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its berries, which are typically red, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>The leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy appearance, contributing to its distinctive botanical profile.</p>
