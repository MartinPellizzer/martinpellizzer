                    <h1>Loranthus mackayensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus mackayensis, commonly known as the Mackay's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, greenish-white flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
