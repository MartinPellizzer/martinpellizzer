                    <h1>Liatris sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Liatris sessiliflora, commonly known as purpletop blazingstar, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear whorled clusters of purple to pinkish-purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Liatris sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
