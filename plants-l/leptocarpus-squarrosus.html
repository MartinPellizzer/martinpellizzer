                    <h1>Leptocarpus squarrosus</h1>
<p>Leptocarpus squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in estuaries and brackish water environments. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in saline conditions. Its roots form a network that stabilizes coastal sediments, playing a vital role in preventing erosion.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity levels, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
