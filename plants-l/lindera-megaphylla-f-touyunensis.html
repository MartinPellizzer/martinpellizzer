                    <h1>Lindera megaphylla f. touyunensis</h1>
<p>Lindera megaphylla f. touyunensis, commonly known as the Yunnan Lindera, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Lindera genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
