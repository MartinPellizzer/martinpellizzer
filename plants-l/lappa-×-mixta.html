<p>Lappa × mixta, commonly known as the hybrid giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which are highly visible and attract pollinators.
