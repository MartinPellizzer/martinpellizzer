                    <h1>Lygodium × fayae</h1>
<p>Lygodium × fayae, commonly known as the hybrid climbing fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Lygodium microphyllum and Lygodium japonicum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth and ability to climb using its wiry, spore-bearing fronds. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically found in clusters. Its rapid spread makes it an invasive species in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
