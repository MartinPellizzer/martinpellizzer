                    <h1>Lycopus maackianus var. ramosissimus</h1>
<p>Lycopus maackianus var. ramosissimus, commonly known as Maack's bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported sedative and antispasmodic properties.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its dense, branched growth habit, which contributes to its common name "ramosissimus," meaning highly branched.</p>
