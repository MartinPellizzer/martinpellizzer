                    <h1>Lepidotis longifolia</h1>
<p>Lepidotis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Lepidotis longifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
