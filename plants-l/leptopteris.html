                    <h1>Leptopteris</h1>
<p>Leptopteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Oleandraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, floating fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a soft, leathery texture and a distinctive, elongated shape. Leptopteris species are often used in ornamental water gardens due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
