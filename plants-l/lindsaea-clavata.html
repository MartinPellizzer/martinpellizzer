                    <h1>Lindsaea clavata</h1>
<p>Lindsaea clavata, commonly known as the club-moss, is a species of fern ally belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in compact, stalked clusters called strobila. Lindsaea clavata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
