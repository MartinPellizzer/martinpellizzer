                    <h1>Larix decidua</h1>
<p>Larix decidua, commonly known as the European larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden and fall off in autumn, distinguishing it from evergreen conifers. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Larix decidua plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is often found in subalpine and alpine habitats.</p>
