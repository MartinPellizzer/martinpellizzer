<p>Lophophora diffusa subsp.</p>
<p>viridescens, commonly known as the peyote cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It features a short, rounded stem that often remains close to the ground, with a greenish-gray coloration that can turn bluish-green under certain conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, typically in response to rainfall. It is known for containing the psychoactive alkaloid mescaline, which has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Due to its cultural and legal significance, it is protected in many regions and requires special permits for cultivation or collection.</p>
