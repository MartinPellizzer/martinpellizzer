<p>Lycium leiostemum, commonly known as the silverleaf lycium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Lycium leiostemum thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient species suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
