<p>Lycopodium magnusianum, commonly known as the Magnusian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of needle-like leaves and distinctive cone-like structures called strobili. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait typical of ancient plant groups.</p>
<p>Its presence in forest ecosystems contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
