                    <h1>Lasiocorys stachydiformis</h1>
<p>Lasiocorys stachydiformis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its succulent structure helps it retain moisture in dry environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Lasiocorys stachydiformis is often found in rocky soils and is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
