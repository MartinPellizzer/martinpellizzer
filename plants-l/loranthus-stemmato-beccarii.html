                    <h1>Loranthus stemmato-beccarii</h1>
<p>Loranthus stemmato-beccarii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a smooth, woody stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often hidden beneath its dense, fleshy berries. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with white or pink petals, and it produces a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
