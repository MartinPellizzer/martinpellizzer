                    <h1>Loranthus ehlersii</h1>
<p>Loranthus ehlersii, commonly known as the Ehlers' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting various insect and bird populations.</p>
