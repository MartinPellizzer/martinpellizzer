                    <h1>Lilium arboricola</h1>
<p>Lilium arboricola, commonly known as the tree lily, is a unique species of lily that grows in a shrub-like form rather than as a traditional herbaceous plant.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often blooming in late summer. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Lilium arboricola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance.</p>
