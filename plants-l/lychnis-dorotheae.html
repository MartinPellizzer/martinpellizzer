<p>Lychnis dorotheae, commonly known as the Dorthea's fireweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Lychnis dorotheae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in mountainous regions.</p>
