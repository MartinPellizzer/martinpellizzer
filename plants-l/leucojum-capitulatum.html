                    <h1>Leucojum capitulatum</h1>
<p>Leucojum capitulatum, commonly known as the white squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter or early spring. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which stores nutrients for the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often used in horticulture for its delicate, early-blooming flowers.</p>
