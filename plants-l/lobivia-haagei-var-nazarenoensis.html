                    <h1>Lobivia haagei var. nazarenoensis</h1>
<p>Lobivia haagei var. nazarenoensis, commonly known as the Nazarenoensis Lobivia, is a rare and compact cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
