                    <h1>Loranthus vitiensis</h1>
<p>Loranthus vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or red, and its berries are typically orange or red, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for various birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
