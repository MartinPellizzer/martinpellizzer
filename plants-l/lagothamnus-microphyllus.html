<p>Lagothamnus microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf lavender or rock lavender, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
