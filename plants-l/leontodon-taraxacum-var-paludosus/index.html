<p>Water dandelion, scientifically known as Leontodon taraxacum var. paludosus, is a unique member of the Asteraceae family that thrives in wetland environments. This plant is characterized by its distinctive rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late spring. Unlike its more common relative, the common dandelion, the water dandelion is adapted to saturated soils and often grows along the edges of ponds and marshes. Its ability to survive in waterlogged conditions makes it an important indicator species for wetland health. Despite its delicate appearance, the water dandelion plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
