                    <h1>Loranthus mexicanus</h1>
<p>Loranthus mexicanus, commonly known as the mistletoe of Mexico, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily from the genus Quercus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to colonize new hosts.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, Loranthus mexicanus can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
