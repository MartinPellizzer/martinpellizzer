                    <h1>Loranthus ligustrinus</h1>
<p>Loranthus ligustrinus, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and seasonal fruiting make it an ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
