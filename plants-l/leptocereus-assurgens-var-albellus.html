<p>Leptocereus assurgens var. albellus, commonly known as the pale night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar stems that are typically covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, usually in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is a prized but challenging plant for cactus enthusiasts.</p>
