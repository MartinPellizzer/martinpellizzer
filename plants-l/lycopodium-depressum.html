                    <h1>Lycopodium depressum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium depressum, commonly known as the low clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its production of small, spore-bearing cones called strobili. Native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. The plant has simple, linear leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Lycopodium depressum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
