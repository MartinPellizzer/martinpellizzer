                    <h1>Loranthus rumphii</h1>
<p>Loranthus rumphii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using some of its own leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Loranthus rumphii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
