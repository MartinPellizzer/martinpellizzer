<p>Lepechinia speciosa, commonly known as the showy lepechinia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Lepechinia speciosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value.</p>
