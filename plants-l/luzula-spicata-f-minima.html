                    <h1>Luzula spicata f. minima</h1>
<p>Luzula spicata f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf woodrush, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses and related plants, though it is often classified as a sedge due to its triangular stems and grass-like foliage. The plant features dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with silver or white markings.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value in rock gardens and shaded borders, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
