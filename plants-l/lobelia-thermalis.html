                    <h1>Lobelia thermalis</h1>
<p>Lobelia thermalis, commonly known as the thermal lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is typically found in geothermal areas where the soil is warmed by underground heat. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Lobelia thermalis plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
