                    <h1>Lobivia walterspielii</h1>
<p>Lobivia walterspielii, commonly known as the Walter's lobivia, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species.</p>
