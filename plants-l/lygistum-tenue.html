<p>Lygistum tenue, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>Lygistum tenue plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
