The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own chlorophyll for partial photosynthesis. Its berries are typically red or yellow, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
