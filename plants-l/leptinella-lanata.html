                    <h1>Leptinella lanata</h1>
<p>Leptinella lanata, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft-textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are usually basal, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Leptinella lanata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
