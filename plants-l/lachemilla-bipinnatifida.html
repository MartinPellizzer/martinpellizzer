                    <h1>Lachemilla bipinnatifida</h1>
<p>Lachemilla bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant features small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically greenish-white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Lachemilla bipinnatifida is well adapted to harsh alpine environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
