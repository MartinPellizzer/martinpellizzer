<p>Lapiedra placiana, commonly known as the "stone plant," is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Lapiedra placiana is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
