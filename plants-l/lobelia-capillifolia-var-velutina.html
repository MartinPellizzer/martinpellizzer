                    <h1>Lobelia capillifolia var. velutina</h1>
<p>Lobelia capillifolia var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety texture, and its clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds via wind.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the more common Lobelia capillifolia, but its unique appearance and habitat preferences distinguish it.</p>
