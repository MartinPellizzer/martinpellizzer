                    <h1>Leptinella albida</h1>
<p>Leptinella albida, commonly known as the white sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Leptinella albida is often used in rock gardens and alpine plant collections due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
