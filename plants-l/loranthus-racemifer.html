                    <h1>Loranthus racemifer</h1>
<p>Loranthus racemifer, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clusters on the host's branches.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open woodlands.</p>
