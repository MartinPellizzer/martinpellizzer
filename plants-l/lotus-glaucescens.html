                    <h1>Lotus glaucescens</h1>
<p>Lotus glaucescens, commonly known as the blue lotus, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clusters in moist environments.</p>
<p>The botanical name reflects its pale blue coloration, which is a distinguishing feature of the species.</p>
