                    <h1>Lachnostylis hanekomii</h1>
<p>Lachnostylis hanekomii, commonly known as the Hanekom's lily, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to South Africa, it is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive red or purple stripe down the center. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
