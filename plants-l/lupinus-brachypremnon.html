                    <h1>Lupinus brachypremnon</h1>
<p>Lupinus brachypremnon, commonly known as the short-stemmed lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces upright spikes of blue to purple flowers. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Lupinus brachypremnon plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
