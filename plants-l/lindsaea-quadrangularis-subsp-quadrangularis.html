<p>Lindsaea quadrangularis subsp.</p>
<p>quadrangularis, commonly known as the quadrangular lindsaea, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular, or four-sided, stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with fertile and sterile leaves differing in structure.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
