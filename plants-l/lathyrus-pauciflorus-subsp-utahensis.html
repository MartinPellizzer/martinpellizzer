<p>Lathyrus pauciflorus subsp.</p>
<p>utahensis, commonly known as the Utah vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds enclosed in pods, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
