<p>Lepigonum marinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to maritime environments. Its unique morphology allows it to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Lepigonum marinum is often found in dunes and rocky shores, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats.</p>
