                    <h1>Lepismium crenatum</h1>
<p>Lepismium crenatum, commonly known as the silver leaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely textured, silver-white leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Lepismium crenatum is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to cascade from supports or trellises.</p>
