<p>Lastreopsis effusa subsp.</p>
<p>confinis, commonly known as the coastal lastreopsis, is a perennial herb native to the rocky shores of New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it survive in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in windy, saline environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other members of the lastreopsis group, which are known for their ability to thrive in coastal and alpine habitats.</p>
