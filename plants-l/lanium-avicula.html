<p>Lanium avicula, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bird's nest-like structure formed by its tightly clustered, leafless stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Lanium avicula thrives in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
