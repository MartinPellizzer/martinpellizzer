<p>Luronium natans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often clustered at the base, with small, scale-like leaves along the stem.</p>
<p>Luronium natans is a semi-terrestrial plant that can sometimes be found in moist soil near water bodies.</p>
