<p>Leptocnide borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its seed pods are hairy and dehiscent, releasing seeds through a mechanism that aids in dispersal.</p>
<p>Leptocnide borbonica is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment.</p>
