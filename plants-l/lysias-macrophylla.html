                    <h1>Lysias macrophylla</h1>
<p>Lysias macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is usually covered in a layer of powdery granules, while the lower surface contains a network of rhizines for attachment. It plays an important role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found on decaying wood and rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
