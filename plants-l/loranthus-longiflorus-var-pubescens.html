                    <h1>Loranthus longiflorus var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Loranthus longiflorus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various regions of Australia and is an example of a hemiparasitic plant with both photosynthetic and parasitic characteristics.</p>
