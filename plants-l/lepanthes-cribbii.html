                    <h1>Lepanthes cribbii</h1>
<p>Lepanthes cribbii, commonly known as the Crimson Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid orange-red flowers with intricate, veined petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is often found in protected reserves.</p>
