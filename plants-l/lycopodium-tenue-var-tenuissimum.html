                    <h1>Lycopodium tenue var. tenuissimum</h1>
<p>Lycopodium tenue var. tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are closely arranged along its stems, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. Its sporophylls are clustered in spore-bearing cones at the tips of the stems, which are characteristic of the Lycopodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its particularly slender leaves compared to other members of the species.</p>
