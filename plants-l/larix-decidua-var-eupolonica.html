<p>Larix decidua var. eupolonica, commonly known as the European larch, is a variant of the European larch tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous conifer, shedding its needle-like leaves in the autumn, which is a rare characteristic among conifers. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense forests or stands on rocky slopes. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
