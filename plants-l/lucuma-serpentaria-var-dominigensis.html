                    <h1>Lucuma serpentaria var. dominigensis</h1>
<p>Lucuma serpentaria var. dominigensis, commonly known as the Dominican lucuma, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Lauraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to other lucuma species but are less commonly cultivated. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and the plant has a woody stem with a distinct aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
