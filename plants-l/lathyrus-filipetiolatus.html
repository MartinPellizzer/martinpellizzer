<p>Lathyrus filipetiolatus, commonly known as the Filippetti's vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often arranged in racemes. Lathyrus filipetiolatus is native to certain regions of Europe and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
