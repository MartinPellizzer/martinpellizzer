<p>Leptochloa fusca, commonly known as slender grass or slender bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Leptochloa fusca is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
