<p>Loranthus caloreas, commonly known as the warm-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are usually green but may turn reddish in certain conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to potential host trees.</p>
