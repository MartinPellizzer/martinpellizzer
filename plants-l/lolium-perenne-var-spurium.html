                    <h1>Lolium perenne var. spurium</h1>
<p>Lolium perenne var. spurium, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to spread and form sod-like mats.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and use in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
