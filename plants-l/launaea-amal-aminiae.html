<p>Launaea amal-aminiae, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system. It produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals but has been used traditionally in local medicine.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
