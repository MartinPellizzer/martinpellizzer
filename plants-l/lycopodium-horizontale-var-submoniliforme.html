                    <h1>Lycopodium horizontale var. submoniliforme</h1>
<p>Lycopodium horizontale var. submoniliforme, commonly known as the horizontal clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant characterized by its creeping habit and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the base of the stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The varietal form submoniliforme is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and growth pattern compared to the typical species.</p>
