<p>Lycium venturii, commonly known as the Venturi boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Lycium venturii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
