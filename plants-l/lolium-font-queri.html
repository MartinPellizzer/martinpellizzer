<p>Lolium font-queri, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and fine-textured blades, which make it a popular choice for lawn and golf course turf. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth habit, with short rhizomes and stolons that help it spread and establish quickly. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Lolium font-queri is also valued for its ability to withstand foot traffic and maintain a consistent green color throughout the growing season.</p>
