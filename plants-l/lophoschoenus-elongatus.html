<p>Lophoschoenus elongatus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important species in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Lophoschoenus elongatus is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
