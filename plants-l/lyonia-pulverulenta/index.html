                            <h1>Lyonia Pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Lyonia, scientifically known as Lyonia pulverulenta, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is commonly referred to as the Carolina alumroot due to its historical use in making alum. This low-growing perennial thrives in woodland and shaded environments, often carpeting the forest floor with its dense foliage. Its distinctive pinkish-purple flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Despite its modest appearance, Lyonia plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability.</p>
