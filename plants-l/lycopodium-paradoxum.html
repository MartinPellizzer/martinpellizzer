<p>Lycopodium paradoxum, commonly known as the paradox lycopod, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage is short-lived, and it relies on spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Lycopodium paradoxum is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
