                    <h1>Linostoma thorelii</h1>
<p>Linostoma thorelii, commonly known as the Thorel's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure, which is typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Linostoma thorelii is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
