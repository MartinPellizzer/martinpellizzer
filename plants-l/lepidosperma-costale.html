<p>Lepidosperma costale, commonly known as the coastal sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or saline environments, often found in saltmarshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures, giving it its genus name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>Lepidosperma costale plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
