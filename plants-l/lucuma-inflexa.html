                    <h1>Lucuma inflexa</h1>
<p>Lucuma inflexa, commonly known as the Andean starfruit, is a member of the Sapotaceae family native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous tree that produces yellow-orange fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. The fruit has a unique star-like shape, which gives it its common name, and is typically harvested when fully mature. The plant thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh Andean conditions and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
