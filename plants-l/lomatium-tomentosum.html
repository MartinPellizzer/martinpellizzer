<p>Lomatium tomentosum, commonly known as the wooly lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features a dense, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which helps to retain moisture and protect against herbivores. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Lomatium tomentosum is often used in traditional herbal medicine and is valued for its aromatic properties.</p>
