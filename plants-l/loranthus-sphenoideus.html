                    <h1>Loranthus sphenoideus</h1>
<p>Loranthus sphenoideus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions.</p>
