<p>Linaria repens var. tristis, commonly known as the weeping toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, slender stems that trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with four petals, resembling those of the common toadflax. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various arid environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
