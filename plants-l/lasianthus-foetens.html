                    <h1>Lasianthus foetens</h1>
<p>Lasianthus foetens, commonly known as the stinking waterplantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender flowering stems. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes referred to as the "stink weed.".</p>
