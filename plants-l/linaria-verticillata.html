                    <h1>Linaria verticillata</h1>
<p>Linaria verticillata, commonly known as the clustered toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and rocky habitats. Linaria verticillata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
