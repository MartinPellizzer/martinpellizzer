                    <h1>Loranthus buxifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus buxifolius, commonly known as the box-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus and acacia species.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and resemble the foliage of boxwood, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
