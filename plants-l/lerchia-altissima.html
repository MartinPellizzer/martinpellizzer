<p>Lerchia altissima, commonly known as the tall lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that can be green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
