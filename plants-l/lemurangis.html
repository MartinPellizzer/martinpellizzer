                    <h1>Lemurangis</h1>
<p>Lemurangis, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment, and it thrives in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, the lemurangis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
