<p>Loxanthocereus crassiserpens, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with a thick, ribbed structure that helps store water. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>The cactus is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 100 years.</p>
