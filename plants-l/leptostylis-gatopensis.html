<p>Leptostylis gatopensis, commonly known as the Gatopensis palm, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure with pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
