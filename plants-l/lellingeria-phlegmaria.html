<p>Lellingeria phlegmaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and ecological sensitivity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
