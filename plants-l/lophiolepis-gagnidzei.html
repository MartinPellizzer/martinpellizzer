<p>Lophiolepis gagnidzei, commonly known as the Gagnidze's lophiolepis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Georgia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants known for their aromatic compounds and often complex inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its native environment, including drought tolerance and efficient nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
