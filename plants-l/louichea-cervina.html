                    <h1>Louichea cervina</h1>
<p>Louichea cervina, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Louichea cervina plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for desert wildlife.</p>
