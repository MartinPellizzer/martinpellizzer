<p>Lemna leiboensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of its leaves.</p>
<p>Lemna leiboensis is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
