<p>Leptospermum polygalifolium subsp.</p>
<p>tropicum, commonly known as the tropical tea tree, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally for its potential medicinal and aromatic benefits.</p>
