                    <h1>Leontonyx candidissimus</h1>
<p>Leontonyx candidissimus, commonly known as the white-leaved lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found on bark or stone in temperate forests. The plant's structure is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth that forms a protective layer over its substratum. Its white or pale green coloration is due to the presence of the algal partner, which performs photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This lichen plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality.</p>
