                    <h1>Lycopodioides minus</h1>
<p>Lycopodioides minus, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Lycopodioides minus typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ancient lineage make it an interesting subject for studying early plant evolution.</p>
