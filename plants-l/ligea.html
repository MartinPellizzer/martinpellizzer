                    <h1>Ligea</h1>
<p>Ligea, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, ribbon-like leaves that resemble ghostly figures, hence its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead anchors itself using rhizoids, which help it absorb nutrients from the water. Ligea is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Its delicate structure and unusual appearance make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
