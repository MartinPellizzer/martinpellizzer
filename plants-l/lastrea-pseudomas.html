                    <h1>Lastrea pseudomas</h1>
<p>Lastrea pseudomas, commonly known as the false stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant typically produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring or summer. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>Lastrea pseudomas is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
