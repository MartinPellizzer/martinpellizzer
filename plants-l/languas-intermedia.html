                    <h1>Languas intermedia</h1>
<p>Languas intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate langua, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reflect excess sunlight. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
