                    <h1>Lupinus trifoliatus</h1>
<p>Lupinus trifoliatus, commonly known as the three-leaved lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Lupinus trifoliatus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects.</p>
