                    <h1>Loranthus curvifolius</h1>
<p>Loranthus curvifolius, commonly known as the curved-leaved mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a distinctive curved shape.</p>
<p>Loranthus curvifolius is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in ecological interactions with its host species.</p>
