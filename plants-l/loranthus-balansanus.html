                    <h1>Loranthus balansanus</h1>
<p>Loranthus balansanus, commonly known as the Balansan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, leafy mass that can grow up to several meters in length, often creating a unique ecological niche. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellowish, and it relies on insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are red and fleshy, serving as a food source for birds and other animals.</p>
