                    <h1>Lemma</h1>
<p>Lemma, commonly known as a type of bract found in grasses, is a modified leaf that encloses the flower in the inflorescence.</p>
<p>It typically forms the lower portion of the spikelet and often resembles a small, scale-like structure. Lemmas are usually tough and leathery, providing protection to the developing florets. They can vary in shape, size, and color depending on the species of grass.</p>
<p>In some cases, lemmas are used in traditional medicine or as a source of food for animals.</p>
