<p>Leptaulus zenkeri var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stalked leptaulus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with four to five petals and prominent stamens, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. This variant is native to tropical regions of Africa, where it thrives in shaded, moist habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
