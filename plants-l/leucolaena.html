<p>Leucolaena, commonly known as silver wattle, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and consists of several species, many of which are shrubs or small trees. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, often with a silvery or pale underside, and produce small, yellow or pale green flowers. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought.</p>
<p>Leucolaena species are also valued for their nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
