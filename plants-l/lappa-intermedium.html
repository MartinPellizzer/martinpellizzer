                    <h1>Lappa intermedium</h1>
<p>Lappa intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white or greenish flowers in its second year. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap and phototoxic compounds, it can be dangerous to handle without proper protection.</p>
