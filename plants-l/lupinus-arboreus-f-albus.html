                    <h1>Lupinus arboreus f. albus</h1>
<p>Lupinus arboreus f. albus, commonly known as the white tree lupine, is a variant of the tree lupine native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or blue hues of the species. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and a woody, shrub-like structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
