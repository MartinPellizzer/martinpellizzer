<p>Luzula alpinopilosa subsp.</p>
<p>alpinopilosa, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomes allow it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in alpine ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings.</p>
