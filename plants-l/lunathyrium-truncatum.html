<p>Lunathyrium truncatum, commonly known as the truncated moonwort, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fern-like leaves that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in a distinctive, umbel-like arrangement.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lunathyrium truncatum is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
