                    <h1>Loranthus francii</h1>
<p>Loranthus francii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems where it grows.</p>
