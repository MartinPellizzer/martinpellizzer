                <h1>Gymnocalycium neocumingii</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium neocumingii, commonly known as the Neocuming's moon cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that can range in color from green to red or purple. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its roots are shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture quickly from the soil.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium neocumingii is well-suited for cultivation in containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
