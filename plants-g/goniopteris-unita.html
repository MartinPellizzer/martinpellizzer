                    <h1>Goniopteris unita</h1>
<p>Goniopteris unita, commonly known as the single-veined water fern, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves with a distinct single central vein. The plant's structure suggests it was adapted for aquatic or wetland environments. Fossil records indicate that it played a significant role in the development of early forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its morphology provides valuable insights into the evolutionary history of ferns and early plant life.</p>
