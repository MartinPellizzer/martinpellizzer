                    <h1>Glechoma bombaiensis</h1>
<p>Glechoma bombaiensis, commonly known as the Himalayan ground ivy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and pairs of opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Glechoma bombaiensis is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine meadows and forest edges.</p>
