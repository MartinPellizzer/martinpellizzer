                    <h1>Gyranthera amphibiolepis</h1>
<p>Gyranthera amphibiolepis, commonly known as the water lily of the wetlands, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a unique adaptation for aquatic environments, with specialized roots that anchor it in muddy substrates. Its reproductive cycle involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination by insects.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss and maintain buoyancy.</p>
