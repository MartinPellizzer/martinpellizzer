                    <h1>Gymnogramma × rollissonii</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma × rollissonii, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gymnogramma sagittata and Gymnogramma lineata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky outcrops. The leaves are typically lanceolate to ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and display a vibrant green coloration. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
