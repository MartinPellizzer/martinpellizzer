<p>Gymnadenia conopsea f. transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian grass of saints, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant pink or lilac-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its floral structure is complex, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
