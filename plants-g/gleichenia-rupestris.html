<p>Gleichenia rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky soils and can often be found on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Gleichenia rupestris is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments.</p>
