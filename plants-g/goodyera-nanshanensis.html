<p>Goodyera nanshanensis, commonly known as the Nanshan slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a slipper, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in cloud forests. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
