                    <h1>Grammitis suspensa</h1>
<p>Grammitis suspensa, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while its delicate fronds cascade downward. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, creating a feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Grammitis suspensa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
