                    <h1>Glyceria infirma</h1>
<p>Glyceria infirma, commonly known as slender glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Glyceria infirma is an important part of the ecological balance in freshwater ecosystems.</p>
