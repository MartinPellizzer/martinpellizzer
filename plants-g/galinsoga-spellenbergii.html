<p>Galinsoga spellenbergii, commonly known as the common gall of the sunflower, is an annual herb native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae, which are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
