                    <h1>Guerinia</h1>
<p>Guerinia, commonly known as the African orchid or Guernsey orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and often grows on cliffs or among succulents. The plants are characterized by their compact, evergreen foliage and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Guerinia species are typically small, with some varieties reaching only a few inches in height, making them popular in rock gardens and container plantings.</p>
<p>They require full sun to partial shade and are relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
