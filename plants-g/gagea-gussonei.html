<p>Gagea gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's bellflower, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, rhizomatous stem. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gagea gussonei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
