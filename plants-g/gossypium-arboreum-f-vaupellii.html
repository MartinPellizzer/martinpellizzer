                    <h1>Gossypium arboreum f. vaupellii</h1>
<p>Gossypium arboreum f. vaupellii, commonly known as the Vaupellii cotton tree, is a rare and ancient cotton species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that produces fluffy, white fibers similar to those of other cotton species. The plant has small, simple leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers. Its fibers are less commercially viable than those of Gossypium hirsutum but are of interest for genetic research.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
