<p>Glyptostrobus lineatus, commonly known as the Chinese cliff pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, scale-like leaves that form a dense, compact foliage. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Glyptostrobus lineatus is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
