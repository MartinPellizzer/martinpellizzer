<p>Grastidium acuminatissimum, commonly known as the sharp-pointed grastidium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
