<p>Govenia lagenophora, commonly known as the bottlebrush lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus, which often has a leathery texture. The plant forms dense, flat growths that can be found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called lirellae, are small, stalked, and contain the lichen's spores.</p>
<p>Govenia lagenophora plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
