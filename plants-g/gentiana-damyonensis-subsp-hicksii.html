<p>Gentiana damyonensis subsp.</p>
<p>hicksii, commonly known as the Hicks' gentian, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
