                    <h1>Gilia gracilis var. villosa</h1>
<p>Gilia gracilis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The hairy gilia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common wildflower in its native range.</p>
