<p>Galearis diantha, commonly known as the pink fairy-orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
