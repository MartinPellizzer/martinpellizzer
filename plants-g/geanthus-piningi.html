                    <h1>Geanthus piningi</h1>
<p>Geanthus piningi, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil efficiently.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Geanthus piningi is considered endangered and is protected in many states.</p>
