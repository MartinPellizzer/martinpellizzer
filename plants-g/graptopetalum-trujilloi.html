                    <h1>Graptopetalum trujilloi</h1>
<p>Graptopetalum trujilloi, commonly known as the Trujillo's stonecrop, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
