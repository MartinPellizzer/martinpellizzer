                    <h1>Gentiana depressa var. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Gentiana depressa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gentian, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to its harsh, mountainous habitat.</p>
