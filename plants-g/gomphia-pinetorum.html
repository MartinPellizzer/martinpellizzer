<p>Gomphia pinetorum, commonly known as the pinegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, particularly near pine trees. Its growth habit is low to the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Gomphia pinetorum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
