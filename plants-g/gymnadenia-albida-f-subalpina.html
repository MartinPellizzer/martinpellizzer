                    <h1>Gymnadenia albida f. subalpina</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia albida f. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine white gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, soft down, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
