<p>Gastrochilus sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran stomach lip, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spurred lip that resembles a stomach in appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a distinct coloration that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
