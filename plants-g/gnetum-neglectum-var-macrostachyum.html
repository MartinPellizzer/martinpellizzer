                    <h1>Gnetum neglectum var. macrostachyum</h1>
<p>Gnetum neglectum var. macrostachyum, commonly known as the giant tropical gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, characterized by its unique combination of gymnosperm-like and angiosperm-like features.</p>
<p>It is a woody plant with smooth, often reddish bark and compound leaves that are typically alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are dioecious, with separate male and female plants. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed aril, a feature that distinguishes it from most other gymnosperms.</p>
<p>This species is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
