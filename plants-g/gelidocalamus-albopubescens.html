                    <h1>Gelidocalamus albopubescens</h1>
<p>Gelidocalamus albopubescens, commonly known as the white-hairy bamboo, is a rare and cold-tolerant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect culms that are covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
