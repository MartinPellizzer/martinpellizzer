                    <h1>Grammitis kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Grammitis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu grammitis, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo, particularly Mount Kinabalu.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in montane forests where it grows on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Grammitis kinabaluensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its limited geographic distribution.</p>
