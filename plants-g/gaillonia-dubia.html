                    <h1>Gaillonia dubia</h1>
<p>Gaillonia dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, pale green to white flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their unique shape. Gaillonia dubia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
