<p>Gymnadenia corneliana var. vesubiana, commonly known as the Vesuvius orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the volcanic soils of the Campanian region in Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soil, often found in areas with a history of volcanic activity. Its floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, featuring three sepals, three petals, and a prominent labellum.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
