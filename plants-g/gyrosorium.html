                    <h1>Gyrosorium</h1>
<p>Gyrosorium, commonly known as the spiral moss, is a genus of mosses characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The leaves are often narrow and spirally twisted, which aids in water retention and light absorption. Gyrosorium species are part of the family Dicranaceae and are found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Their simple yet efficient structure makes them important components of forest ecosystems.</p>
