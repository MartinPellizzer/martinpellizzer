<p>Gagea graeca subsp.</p>
<p>trinervia, commonly known as the Greek spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece and Turkey. It produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which give it the subspecies name *trinervia*. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
