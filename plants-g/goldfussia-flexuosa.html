The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Goldfussia flexuosa is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
