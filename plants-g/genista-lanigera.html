                    <h1>Genista lanigera</h1>
<p>Genista lanigera, commonly known as the woolly broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its dense, thorny stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, leathery pods containing seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Genista lanigera is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates.</p>
