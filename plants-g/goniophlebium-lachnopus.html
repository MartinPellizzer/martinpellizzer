<p>Goniophlebium lachnopus, commonly known as the yellow alpine moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and yellowish-green foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the presence of sunlight. This plant is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Goniophlebium lachnopus plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
