<p>Galium boreale subsp.</p>
<p>rubioides, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats with slender, often reddish stems and small, opposite leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in nutrient-poor, moist soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to cold climates, including a short growing season and frost-resistant physiology.</p>
