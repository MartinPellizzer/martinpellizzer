                    <h1>Glyceria mexicana</h1>
<p>Glyceria mexicana, commonly known as Mexican glyceria, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib.</p>
<p>Glyceria mexicana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms.</p>
