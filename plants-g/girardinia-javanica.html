<p>Girardinia javanica, commonly known as the Javanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which can help stabilize sediments.</p>
<p>Girardinia javanica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
