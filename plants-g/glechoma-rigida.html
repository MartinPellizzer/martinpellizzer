                    <h1>Glechoma rigida</h1>
<p>Glechoma rigida, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its aggressive growth habit makes it both a valuable ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated gardens.</p>
