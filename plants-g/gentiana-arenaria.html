<p>Gentiana arenaria, commonly known as the sand gentian, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Gentiana arenaria is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
