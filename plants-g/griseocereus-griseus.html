<p>Griseocereus griseus, commonly known as the gray cactus or the ghost cactus, is a species of cacti native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a layer of white or grayish bloom, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by the development of small, red fruits. Griseocereus griseus is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
