                    <h1>Genlisea exhibitionista</h1>
<p>Genlisea exhibitionista, commonly known as the "showy buttercup," is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and specialized bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant's leaves are modified into intricate, bladder-shaped structures that can rapidly snap shut to trap tiny insects. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, relying on captured prey for essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
