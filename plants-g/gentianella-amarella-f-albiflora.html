<p>Gentianella amarella f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered gentian, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its pale to white flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the Mediterranean area. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers, which bloom in summer, are often clustered in inflorescences and are notable for their striking contrast against the plant's dark green foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
