                    <h1>Goodyera wolongensis</h1>
<p>Goodyera wolongensis, commonly known as the Wolong orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or white, bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Goodyera wolongensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
