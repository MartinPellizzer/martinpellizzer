                    <h1>Glossorhyncha dubia</h1>
<p>Glossorhyncha dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, making it a hemiparasitic species. Its habitat is highly specialized, requiring specific moisture and light conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Glossorhyncha dubia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
