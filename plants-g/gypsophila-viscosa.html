                    <h1>Gypsophila viscosa</h1>
<p>Gypsophila viscosa, commonly known as sticky gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces tiny, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is generally resistant to pests and diseases.</p>
