<p>Gymnadenia sesamoides, commonly known as the pink fairy-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and northwest Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in well-drained soils. Gymnadenia sesamoides has a slender, upright stem with a single spike of flowers, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
