<p>Galium peregrinum, commonly known as wandering wood-sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a mild, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
