<p>Gymnanthes multiramea, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. Gymnanthes multiramea is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for furniture and carving.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
