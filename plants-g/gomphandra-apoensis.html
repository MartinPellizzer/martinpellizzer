                    <h1>Gomphandra apoensis</h1>
<p>Gomphandra apoensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for life in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Gomphandra apoensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research.</p>
