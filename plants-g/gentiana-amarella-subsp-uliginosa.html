<p>Gentiana amarella subsp.</p>
<p>uliginosa, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or heathlands, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment.</p>
