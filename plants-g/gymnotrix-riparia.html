<p>Gymnotrix riparia, commonly known as the river gentian, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverine habitats of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic environment. Gymnotrix riparia is a perennial herb that thrives in shallow, slow-moving water, often forming dense mats that stabilize riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for water quality and its ecological importance in supporting aquatic biodiversity.</p>
