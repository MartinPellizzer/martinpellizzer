                    <h1>Grammitis armstrongii</h1>
<p>Grammitis armstrongii, commonly known as Armstrong's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, moss-like appearance with small, overlapping leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-bearing clusters called sporangial clusters.</p>
<p>Grammitis armstrongii is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in humid, tropical habitats.</p>
