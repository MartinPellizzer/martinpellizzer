<p>Goodyera repens subsp.</p>
<p>ophioides, commonly known as the creeping pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender rhizomes and broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, nodding flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat.</p>
<p>This orchid is often found in moist, shaded areas, such as forest floors, where it forms dense mats.</p>
