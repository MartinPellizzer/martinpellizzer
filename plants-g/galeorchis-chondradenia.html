<p>Galeorchis chondradenia, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This terrestrial orchid features a single, showy yellow flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure that attracts pollinators. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
