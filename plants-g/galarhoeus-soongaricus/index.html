<p>Siberian iris, scientifically known as Galarhoeus soongaricus, is a striking perennial plant native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is celebrated for its elegant, blue or violet flower spikes that bloom in late spring and early summer. This hardy plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near wetlands or along riverbanks. With its ability to withstand harsh winters, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate regions. Its unique beauty and resilience make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
