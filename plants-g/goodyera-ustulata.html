<p>Goodyera ustulata, commonly known as the spotted potterscale, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and its unique, spotted orchid flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as hardwood forests and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Goodyera ustulata is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids in its native range.</p>
