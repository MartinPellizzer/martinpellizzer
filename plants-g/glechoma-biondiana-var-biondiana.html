<p>Glechoma biondiana var. biondiana, commonly known as the silverweed or creeping charlock, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by four-angled, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its hairy leaves and rapid spread make it both a notable ornamental and a potential weed in certain habitats.</p>
