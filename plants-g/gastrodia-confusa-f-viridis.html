                    <h1>Gastrodia confusa f. viridis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia confusa f. viridis, commonly known as the green-flowered gastrodia, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and distinctive greenish-yellow flowers that differ from the typical brownish hues of the species. The plant produces a fleshy, tuberous root system, which is often harvested for traditional medicinal purposes. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically found in dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
