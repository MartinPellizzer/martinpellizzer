<p>Goniophlebium mehipitense, commonly known as the Mehipi fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
