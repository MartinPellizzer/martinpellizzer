                    <h1>Globularia nana</h1>
<p>Globularia nana, commonly known as the dwarf globularia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and aesthetic value.</p>
