                    <h1>Galium platygalium</h1>
<p>Galium platygalium, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Galium platygalium is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
