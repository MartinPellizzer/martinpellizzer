<p>Gynochthodes alejandroi, commonly known as the Alejandro's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate floral structure. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often hidden within the foliage, making it difficult to spot. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threatened status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
