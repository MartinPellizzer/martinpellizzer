<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers are followed by pale yellow fruits that contain numerous tiny, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Gymnocereus microspermus is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, with spines that provide protection from herbivores.</p>
