<p>Glycinopsis densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
