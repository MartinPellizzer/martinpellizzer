                    <h1>Gossypium barbadense var. maritimum</h1>
<p>Gossypium barbadense var. maritimum, commonly known as the sea cotton, is a rare and salt-tolerant variety of cotton native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand high levels of salt in its environment. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are used in textile production, similar to other cotton species. Its unique ability to grow in harsh coastal conditions makes it an important subject in agricultural and ecological studies.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other cotton varieties due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
