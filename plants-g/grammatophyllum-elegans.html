                    <h1>Grammatophyllum elegans</h1>
<p>Grammatophyllum elegans, commonly known as the elegant staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome that supports its structure and stores water. Its fronds are large, leathery, and often have a distinctive, branching pattern that resembles antlers.</p>
<p>Grammatophyllum elegans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest canopies.</p>
