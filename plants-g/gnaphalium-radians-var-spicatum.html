<p>Gnaphalium radians var. spicatum, commonly known as the spiculate cudweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
