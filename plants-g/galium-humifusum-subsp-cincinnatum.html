<p>Galium humifusum subsp.</p>
<p>cincinnatum, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges.</p>
