                    <h1>Glycine lancifolia</h1>
<p>Glycine lancifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cowpea, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broad and have a distinctive lanciform shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Glycine lancifolia is often grown for its nutritional value, as the seeds are a good source of protein.</p>
<p>It also plays a role in soil improvement due to its ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
