                    <h1>Garcinia arenicola</h1>
<p>Garcinia arenicola, commonly known as the sand garcinia, is a species of flowering plant native to coastal areas of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain a single seed. Garcinia arenicola thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or along the edges of mangrove forests.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
