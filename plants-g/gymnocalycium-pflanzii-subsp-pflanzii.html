<p>Gymnocalycium pflanzii subsp.</p>
<p>pflanzii, commonly known as the Pflanz's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its globular or cylindrical stem, which is often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in many desert plants for water conservation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts.</p>
