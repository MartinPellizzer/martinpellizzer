                    <h1>Geraniospermum multifidum</h1>
<p>Geraniospermum multifidum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its thick, water-storing stems and leaves help it survive in dry environments by reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Geraniospermum multifidum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in harsh, desert-like conditions.</p>
