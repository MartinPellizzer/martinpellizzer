                    <h1>Gladiolus woodii</h1>
<p>Gladiolus woodii, commonly known as the Wood's gladiolus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, it is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, spurred petals that resemble a sword, giving it its genus name "gladiolus.". It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, though it is sensitive to frost and requires careful cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat loss, Gladiolus woodii is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts.</p>
