<p>Gagea pygmaea subsp.</p>
<p>corsica, commonly known as Corsican gagea, is a small bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that are adapted to survive in rocky or dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
