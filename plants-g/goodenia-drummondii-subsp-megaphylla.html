<p>Goodenia drummondii subsp.</p>
<p>megaphylla, commonly known as the Drummond's goodenia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
