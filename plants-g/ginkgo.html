                    <h1>Ginkgo</h1>
<p>Ginkgo, commonly known as the maidenhair tree, is an ancient deciduous tree with a unique fan-shaped leaf structure.</p>
<p>It is one of the oldest living tree species, dating back over 270 million years. The leaves are typically bright green in summer and turn a striking yellow in autumn before falling. Ginkgo trees are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female trees, and they produce distinctive, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its resilience to pollution and urban environments, making it a popular choice for city landscaping.</p>
