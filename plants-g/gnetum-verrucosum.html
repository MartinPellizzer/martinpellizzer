                    <h1>Gnetum verrucosum</h1>
<p>Gnetum verrucosum, commonly known as the African gnetum, is a gymnosperm native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and scale-like leaves, which are typical of the Gnetophyta division. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind pollination. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed structure, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Gnetum verrucosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps.</p>
