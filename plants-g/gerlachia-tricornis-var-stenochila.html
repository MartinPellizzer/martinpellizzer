                    <h1>Gerlachia tricornis var. stenochila</h1>
<p>Gerlachia tricornis var. stenochila, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gerlachia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and related succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a common adaptation for water conservation in desert environments.</p>
<p>The narrow, lance-shaped leaves are another distinguishing feature of this variety.</p>
