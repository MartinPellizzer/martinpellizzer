                    <h1>Gothofreda propinqua</h1>
<p>Gothofreda propinqua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
