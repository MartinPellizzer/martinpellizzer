<p>Gilia atractyloides, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters, characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The flowers are usually blue to purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive tubular throat, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions through its deep root system and ability to conserve water.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
