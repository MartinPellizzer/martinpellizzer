<p>Goniophlebium hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth and fronds that are densely covered with soft, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that are often slightly curled.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
