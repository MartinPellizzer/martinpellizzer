                    <h1>Gutierrezia linoides</h1>
<p>Gutierrezia linoides, commonly known as silverleaf gumweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family, and is often found in dry, sandy soils. It has adapted to arid environments through deep root systems and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Gutierrezia linoides is also used in traditional medicine and has ecological value as a food source for certain wildlife species.</p>
