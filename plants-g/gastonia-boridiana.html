                    <h1>Gastonia boridiana</h1>
<p>Gastonia boridiana, commonly known as the red-stemmed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk that is often reddish in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern around the trunk. Its cones are separate, with male and female cones occurring on different plants, a feature typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Gastonia boridiana is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive.</p>
