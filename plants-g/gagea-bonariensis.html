                    <h1>Gagea bonariensis</h1>
<p>Gagea bonariensis, commonly known as the Buenos Aires gagea, is a small, bulbous geophyte native to South America.</p>
<p>It produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive periods of dormancy.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
