<p>Gastrochilus acutus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, often blooming during the rainy season. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Gastrochilus acutus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
