                    <h1>Glyceria plicata var. declinata</h1>
<p>Glyceria plicata var. declinata, commonly known as the bentgrass or rivergrass, is a variant of the genus Glyceria, which belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and is often found in wetland or aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, and its leaves are narrow and slightly folded, giving it a distinct morphology. It plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This variant is less commonly cultivated than other Glyceria species but is of interest in ecological studies.</p>
