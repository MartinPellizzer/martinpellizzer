                <h1>Galanthus nivalis</h1>
<p>Galanthus nivalis, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, nodding white flowers with a yellow-green spathe, which bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in woodland and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season.</p>
<p>Galanthus nivalis is notable for its resilience and is often one of the first flowers to appear in the spring.</p>
