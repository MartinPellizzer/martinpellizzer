<p>Glabraria vestita, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. This plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic invertebrates. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
