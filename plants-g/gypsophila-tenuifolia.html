                    <h1>Gypsophila tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Gypsophila tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing delicate, pea-like flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Gypsophila tenuifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
