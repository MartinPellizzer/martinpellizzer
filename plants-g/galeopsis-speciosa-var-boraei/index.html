                            <h1>Galeopsis Speciosa Var. Boraei</h1>
<p>Blueweed, scientifically known as Galeopsis speciosa var. boraei, is a lesser-known yet fascinating member of the mint family. Native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in rocky and alpine environments where few plants can survive. Its striking blue flowers, which bloom in late summer, make it a unique addition to wildflower gardens and natural habitats. Despite its beauty, Blueweed remains underappreciated and often overlooked by both gardeners and botanists. This article explores the characteristics, habitat, and ecological significance of this rare and resilient plant.</p>
