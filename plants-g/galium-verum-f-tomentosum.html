                    <h1>Galium verum f. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Galium verum f. tomentosum, commonly known as the yellow bedstraw, is a variant of the yellow woodruff plant.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves and stems are often covered in a soft, woolly texture due to the presence of the tomentose hairs.</p>
<p>This form is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
