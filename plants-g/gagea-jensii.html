                    <h1>Gagea jensii</h1>
<p>Gagea jensii, commonly known as the mountain gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a single white or pale pink flower per stem, often with a distinct scent. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
