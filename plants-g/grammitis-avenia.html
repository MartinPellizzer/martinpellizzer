<p>Grammitis avenia, commonly known as the slender field fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped fronds with a soft, moss-like appearance, often growing in shaded, moist environments. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, typical of ferns, and thrives in acidic soil conditions.</p>
<p>Grammitis avenia is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation.</p>
