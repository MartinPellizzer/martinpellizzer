                    <h1>Galactia tuberosa</h1>
<p>Galactia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous galactia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive tuberous roots that store nutrients. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Galactia tuberosa is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it beneficial for soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
