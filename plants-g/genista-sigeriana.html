                    <h1>Genista sigeriana</h1>
<p>Genista sigeriana, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its slender, spreading stems form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in rocky or dry soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, pinnately compound, and often have a silvery-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
