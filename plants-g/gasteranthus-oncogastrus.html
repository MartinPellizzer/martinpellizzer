                <h1>Gasteranthus oncogastrus</h1>
<p>Gasteranthus oncogastrus, commonly known as the "gasteranthus" or "flowering gasteranthus," is a unique plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fleshy, and brightly colored flowers that resemble a stomach, hence its genus name. The plant has a short, erect stem and produces small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Gasteranthus oncogastrus is also known for its ability to produce a toxic sap, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
