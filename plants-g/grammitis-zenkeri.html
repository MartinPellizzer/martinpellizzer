                    <h1>Grammitis zenkeri</h1>
<p>Grammitis zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's spikemoss, is a fern-like vascular plant belonging to the family Huperjiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, moss-like growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in two ranks. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila at the tips of the stems. Grammitis zenkeri is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
