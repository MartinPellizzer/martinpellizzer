                    <h1>Gerardia neoscotica</h1>
<p>Gerardia neoscotica, commonly known as the New Scotia gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in rocky and sandy soils. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Gerardia neoscotica plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an indicator species for Arctic and alpine ecosystems.</p>
