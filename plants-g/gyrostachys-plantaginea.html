<p>Gyrostachys plantaginea, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, rocky soils and withstand periods of drought. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Gyrostachys plantaginea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
