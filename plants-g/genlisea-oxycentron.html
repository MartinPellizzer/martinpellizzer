                    <h1>Genlisea oxycentron</h1>
<p>Genlisea oxycentron, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of carnivorous plants that belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Genlisea oxycentron is typically found in wetland environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant's unique morphology includes small, herbaceous stems and leaves that form dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Its ability to capture prey through these bladders is an adaptation to its nutrient-deficient habitat.</p>
