<p>Gastrodia takeshimensis var. takeshimensis, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tuberous rhizome, which is highly valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on decaying logs or stumps. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow in color, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
