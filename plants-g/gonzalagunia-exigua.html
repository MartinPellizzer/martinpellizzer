<p>Gonzalagunia exigua, commonly known as the slender gonzalagunia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gonzalagunia exigua is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
