<p>Gymnocalycium damsii subsp.</p>
<p>evae, commonly known as the Eave's moon cactus, is a low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stems, which are typically green or bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers during the cooler months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It has a dense, spiny covering that provides protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens and indoor collections.</p>
