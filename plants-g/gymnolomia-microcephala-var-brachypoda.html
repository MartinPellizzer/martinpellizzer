                    <h1>Gymnolomia microcephala var. brachypoda</h1>
<p>Gymnolomia microcephala var. brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf pittosporum, is a compact shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and densely packed. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance.</p>
<p>The varietal name "brachypoda" refers to its short, stocky growth habit.</p>
