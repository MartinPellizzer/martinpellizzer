                    <h1>Gossypium hirsutum var. micranthum</h1>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum var. micranthum, commonly known as the dwarf cotton plant, is a variant of upland cotton characterized by its shorter stature and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It exhibits smaller flowers and bolls compared to the standard G. hirsutum, which can influence its yield and fiber quality. This variety is often studied for its genetic traits that may contribute to drought resistance and stress tolerance. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in plant breeding programs aimed at improving agricultural resilience.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and reproductive characteristics are closely related to its ecological adaptations in various growing environments.</p>
