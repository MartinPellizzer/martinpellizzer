<p>Goniopteris canescens, commonly known as the woolly cliff fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of pale, woolly hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal or cliff habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, short pinnae that give it a distinctive, compact appearance.</p>
