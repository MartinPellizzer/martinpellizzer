                    <h1>Grammitis micropteris</h1>
<p>Grammitis micropteris, commonly known as the small-winged filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of moisture. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and have a distinct, feather-like structure, with small, winged pinnae that give it its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is often difficult to cultivate outside of its natural habitat.</p>
