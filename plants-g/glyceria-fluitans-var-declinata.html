<p>Glyceria fluitans var. declinata, commonly known as the leaning watergrass, is a variant of the watergrass species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often grow along the surface of water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating or partially submerged, adapting to aquatic conditions.</p>
