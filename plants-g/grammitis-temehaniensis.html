                    <h1>Grammitis temehaniensis</h1>
<p>Grammitis temehaniensis, commonly known as the Temehani fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Grammitidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form dense, mat-like structures on tree trunks and branches. The plant's rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in high humidity and shaded environments, making it a common sight in the understory of humid forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
