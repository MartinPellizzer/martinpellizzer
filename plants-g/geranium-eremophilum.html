<p>Geranium eremophilum, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often with a silvery or grayish underside, adapted to reflect sunlight and conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Geranium eremophilum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
