<p>Glossopetalum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly milkbush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
