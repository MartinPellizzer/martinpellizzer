                    <h1>Globulea ammophila</h1>
<p>Globulea ammophila, commonly known as the sand-binding globule, is a flowering plant native to coastal dunes in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, globe-shaped seed pods. Its root system helps stabilize dunes, making it ecologically important for preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Globulea ammophila is adapted to salt spray and high winds, showcasing its resilience in harsh coastal environments.</p>
