<p>Guzmania kareniae, commonly known as the Karenia guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range from red to orange or yellow, depending on the variety. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Guzmania kareniae is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
