<p>Geonoma macrospatha, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, elongated, and often leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in dense spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>Geonoma macrospatha is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
