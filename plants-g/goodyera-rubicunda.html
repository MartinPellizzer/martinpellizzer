<p>Goodyera rubicunda, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with distinctive red veins. Goodyera rubicunda is epiphytic in some regions, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a visually striking and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
