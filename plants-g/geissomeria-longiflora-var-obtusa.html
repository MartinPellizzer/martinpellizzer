<p>Geissomeria longiflora var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in early spring, which are followed by spherical, blue-black berries. These berries are edible for birds and can persist on the plant well into the winter.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
