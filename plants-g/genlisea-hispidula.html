                    <h1>Genlisea hispidula</h1>
<p>Genlisea hispidula, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils, such as marshes and bogs. Its leaves are often submerged, and it lacks true roots, relying on its stems for anchorage.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature, aiding in its identification.</p>
