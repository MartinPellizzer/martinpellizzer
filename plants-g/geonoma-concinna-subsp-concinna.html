<p>Geonoma concinna subsp.</p>
<p>concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leafed geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dimorphic, with fertile and sterile leaves differing in shape and structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
