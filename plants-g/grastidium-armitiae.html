                    <h1>Grastidium armitiae</h1>
<p>Grastidium armitiae, commonly known as the silverleaf cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with a dense covering of silvery-white hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
