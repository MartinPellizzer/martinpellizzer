                    <h1>Goniophlebium squamatum</h1>
<p>Goniophlebium squamatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silvery, scale-like structures. These scales give the plant its common name and contribute to its ability to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
