                    <h1>Grammitis geluensis</h1>
<p>Grammitis geluensis, commonly known as the ice fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or shaded areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature and habitat specificity, Grammitis geluensis is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
