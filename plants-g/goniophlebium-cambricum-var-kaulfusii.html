                    <h1>Goniophlebium cambricum var. kaulfusii</h1>
<p>Goniophlebium cambricum var. kaulfusii, commonly known as the Welsh fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern native to western Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
