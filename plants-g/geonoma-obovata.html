                    <h1>Geonoma obovata</h1>
<p>Geonoma obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
