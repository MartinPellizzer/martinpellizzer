                    <h1>Gothofreda microphylla</h1>
<p>Gothofreda microphylla, commonly known as the tiny-leafed ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reflect intense sunlight. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise cryptic appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
