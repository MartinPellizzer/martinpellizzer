                    <h1>Glyceria insularis</h1>
<p>Glyceria insularis, commonly known as the island glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along the edges of ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Glyceria insularis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
