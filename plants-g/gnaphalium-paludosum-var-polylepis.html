<p>Gnaphalium paludosum var. polylepis, commonly known as the swamp everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear small, clustered yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its flowers produce copious amounts of small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize and persist in wetland environments.</p>
