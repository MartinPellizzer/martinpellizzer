                    <h1>Geocarpon minimum</h1>
<p>Geocarpon minimum, commonly known as the small earthstar, is a rare and elusive fungal plant that belongs to the family Geoglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique subterranean growth habit, with a small, star-shaped fruiting body that emerges only briefly after rain. The plant produces a distinctive, sticky, dark-colored spore mass that is released into the air. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in woodlands or on forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and cryptic life cycle, it is considered a challenging subject for botanical study.</p>
