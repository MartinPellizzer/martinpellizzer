<p>Gagea guadarramica, commonly known as the Guadarrama spring bulb, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained and sunny habitats. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh environments, often remaining dormant during dry periods.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
