                    <h1>Geranium heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Geranium heterophyllum, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Geranium heterophyllum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
