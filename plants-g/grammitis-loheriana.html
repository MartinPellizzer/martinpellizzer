<p>Grammitis loheriana, commonly known as the Loher's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperjaniales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in spore-producing clusters called strobila.</p>
