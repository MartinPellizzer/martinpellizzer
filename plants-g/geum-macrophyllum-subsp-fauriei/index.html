                            <h1>Geum Macrophyllum Subsp. Fauriei</h1>
<p>Faurie's avens, scientifically known as Geum macrophyllum subsp. fauriei, is a striking member of the Rosaceae family native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. This perennial herb is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors, often forming dense colonies in its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens and conservation efforts. The plant's resilience and beauty make it a notable species in both botanical and horticultural contexts.</p>
