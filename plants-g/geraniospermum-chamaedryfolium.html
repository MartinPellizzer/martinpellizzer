<p>Geraniospermum chamaedryfolium, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Geraniospermum chamaedryfolium is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
