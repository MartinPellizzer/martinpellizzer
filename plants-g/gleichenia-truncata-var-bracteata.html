                    <h1>Gleichenia truncata var. bracteata</h1>
<p>Gleichenia truncata var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate cliff fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often on cliffs or in shaded, moist areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by the presence of bracts, which are modified leaves that protect the spore-producing structures.</p>
