                    <h1>Gnaphalium lagopus</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium lagopus, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense heads, which are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a powdery coating, helping to reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium lagopus is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
