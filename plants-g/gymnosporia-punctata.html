                    <h1>Gymnosporia punctata</h1>
<p>Gymnosporia punctata, commonly known as the African barberry, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Gymnosporia punctata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties.</p>
