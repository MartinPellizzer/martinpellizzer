                    <h1>Gastrodia huapingensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia huapingensis, commonly known as the Huaping thunder god mushroom, is a rare and unique orchidaceous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic species, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a fleshy, tuberous structure that resembles a mushroom, which is the main part used in traditional medicine. It grows in shaded, moist forest environments and is highly valued for its purported medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
