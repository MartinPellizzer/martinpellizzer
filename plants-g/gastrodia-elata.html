                    <h1>Gastrodia elata</h1>
<p>Gastrodia elata, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god mushroom, is a unique orchid that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that grows on the roots of certain trees, primarily in the forests of China, Korea, and Japan. The plant is notable for its fleshy, tuberous structure and its ability to produce a strong, spicy aroma. It is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Gastrodia elata is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
