                    <h1>Galium × pralognense</h1>
<p>Galium × pralognense, commonly known as the hybrid wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Galium verum (common wood sorrel) and Galium aparine (common bedstraw), resulting in a plant with unique morphological characteristics. The species typically features slender, ascending stems covered in small, hooked hairs, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, Galium × pralognense exhibits variability in growth habits and floral morphology.</p>
