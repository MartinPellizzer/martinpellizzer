                    <h1>Gypsocallis vagans var. alba</h1>
<p>Gypsocallis vagans var. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered gypsocallis, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in parts of Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
