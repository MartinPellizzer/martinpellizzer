<p>Goodyera yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushiman Islands lady's tresses, is a rare terrestrial orchid native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and delicate, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose raceme. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. It has a short rhizome and produces a single, narrow spathaceous bract that encloses the inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
