                    <h1>Gnaphalium arenarium var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium arenarium var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf sand everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow and gray-green, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly soils, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a hardy, ornamental plant in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
