<p>Goniopteris semihastata, commonly known as the semi-hastate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive semi-hastate (spearhead-like) shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and water features.</p>
