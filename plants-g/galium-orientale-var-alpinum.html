                    <h1>Galium orientale var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Galium orientale var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine woodcrushers, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with stiff, glandular hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating, while the flowers are small, white, and clustered in cymes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical G. orientale by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology.</p>
