                    <h1>Gothofreda gracilis</h1>
<p>Gothofreda gracilis, commonly known as the slender ghost fern, is a delicate and rare species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Gothofreda gracilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
