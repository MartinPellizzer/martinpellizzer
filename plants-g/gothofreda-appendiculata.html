                    <h1>Gothofreda appendiculata</h1>
<p>Gothofreda appendiculata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is listed as endangered in several regions.</p>
