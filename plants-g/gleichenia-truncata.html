<p>Gleichenia truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive truncate (cut-off) shape at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Gleichenia truncata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
