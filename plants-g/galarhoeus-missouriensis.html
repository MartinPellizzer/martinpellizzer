<p>Galarhoeus missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the central United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland health.</p>
