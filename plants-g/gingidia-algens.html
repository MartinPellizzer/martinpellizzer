<p>Gingidia algens, commonly known as the sea ginger, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are adapted to withstand saline and arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Gingidia algens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
