                    <h1>Guzmania patula</h1>
<p>Guzmania patula, commonly known as the pink torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red bracts that resemble a torch, which are often more showy than its small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall flower spike that bears small, white flowers, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Guzmania patula is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
