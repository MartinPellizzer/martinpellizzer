<p>Grammitis reducta, commonly known as the reduced maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Grammitis reducta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
