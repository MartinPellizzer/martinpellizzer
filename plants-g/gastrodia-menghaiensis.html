                    <h1>Gastrodia menghaiensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia menghaiensis, commonly known as Menghai gastrodia, is a rare orchid species native to China, particularly in the Yunnan province.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces unique, fleshy, yellowish-brown pseudobulbs that store nutrients and water. It blooms with small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
