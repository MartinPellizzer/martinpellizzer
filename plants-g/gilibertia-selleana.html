<p>Gilibertia selleana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red, woody stem and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is valued for its hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
