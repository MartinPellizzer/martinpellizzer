                    <h1>Gastrorchis</h1>
<p>Gastrorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with long, thin roots and a single, slender stem that produces a single, waxy flower. Gastrorchis is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and declining population, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
