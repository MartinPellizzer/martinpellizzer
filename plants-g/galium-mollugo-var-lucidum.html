                    <h1>Galium mollugo var. lucidum</h1>
<p>Galium mollugo var. lucidum, commonly known as glossy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a glossy appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shiny foliage and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
