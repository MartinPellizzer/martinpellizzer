<p>Gymnocalycium marekiorum var. guaraniorum, commonly known as the Guarani prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates.</p>
