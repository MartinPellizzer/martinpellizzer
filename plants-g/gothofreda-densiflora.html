                <h1>Gothofreda densiflora</h1>
<p>Gothofreda densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered ghost fern, is a unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
