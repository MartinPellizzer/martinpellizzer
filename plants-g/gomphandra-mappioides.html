                    <h1>Gomphandra mappioides</h1>
<p>Gomphandra mappioides, commonly known as the Mappi fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gomphandra mappioides is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
