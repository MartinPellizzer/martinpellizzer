                    <h1>Guzmania longipetala</h1>
<p>Guzmania longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features vibrant, long, and narrow inflorescences that can reach up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest bromeliads. The plant's rosette of broad, waxy leaves forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, are borne on tall, spiky stems.</p>
<p>Guzmania longipetala thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish.</p>
