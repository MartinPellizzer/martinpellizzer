<p>Grammitis laxa, commonly known as the slender huperzia, is a fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis laxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
