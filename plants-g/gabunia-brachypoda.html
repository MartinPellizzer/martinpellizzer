                    <h1>Gabunia brachypoda</h1>
<p>Gabunia brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed gabunia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, woody stems that are often covered in a thin layer of bark. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand humid and sometimes rainy conditions.</p>
<p>Gabunia brachypoda is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision.</p>
