<p>Grammitis brooksiae, commonly known as the Brooks' spikemoss, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperjaniaceae and is characterized by its small, creeping stems and dense clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are borne on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
