<p>Grammitis caricifolia, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor or water surfaces.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
