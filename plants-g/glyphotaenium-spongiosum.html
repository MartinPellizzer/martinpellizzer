                    <h1>Glyphotaenium spongiosum</h1>
<p>Glyphotaenium spongiosum, commonly known as the spongey bladder grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species adapted to drought.</p>
<p>Glyphotaenium spongiosum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
