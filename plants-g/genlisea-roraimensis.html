                    <h1>Genlisea roraimensis</h1>
<p>Genlisea roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap microscopic prey, a feature typical of its carnivorous relatives. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils, often found in isolated habitats such as mountain pools. Its leaves are submerged, while its stems and roots are anchored in the substrate.</p>
<p>Genlisea roraimensis is notable for its specialized morphology and ecological adaptation to its specific environment.</p>
