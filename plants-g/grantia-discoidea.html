                    <h1>Grantia discoidea</h1>
<p>Grantia discoidea, commonly known as the disc-shaped sea sponge, is a marine organism belonging to the phylum Porifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, disc-like body structure and a porous surface that facilitates water flow. The plant, or more accurately, the animal, lacks true tissues and organs, instead having a simple structure composed of choanocytes and a sponge-like matrix. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Grantia discoidea plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by filtering water and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
