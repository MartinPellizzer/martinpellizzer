                    <h1>Gomphogyne heterosperma</h1>
<p>Gomphogyne heterosperma, commonly known as the African orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can receive the necessary light for photosynthesis. Its flowers are often fragrant, attracting pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gomphogyne heterosperma is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
