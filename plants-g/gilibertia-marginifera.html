                    <h1>Gilibertia marginifera</h1>
<p>Gilibertia marginifera, commonly known as the red sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, which attract various pollinators. Its root system is extensive and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Gilibertia marginifera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
