                    <h1>Gagea artemczukii</h1>
<p>Gagea artemczukii, commonly known as the Armenian spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
