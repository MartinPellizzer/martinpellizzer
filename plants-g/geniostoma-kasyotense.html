<p>Geniostoma kasyotense, commonly known as the Kasyotense fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially emergent. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>It plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
