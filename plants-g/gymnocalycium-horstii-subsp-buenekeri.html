<p>Gymnocalycium horstii subsp.</p>
<p>buenekeri, commonly known as the "Buenekeri moon cactus," is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It features a swollen, globular stem that is often brightly colored, ranging from yellow to orange, and is covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically borne on short, lateral stems. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is prized in horticulture for its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
