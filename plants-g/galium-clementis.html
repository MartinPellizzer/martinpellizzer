                    <h1>Galium clementis</h1>
<p>Galium clementis, commonly known as the lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium clementis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations.</p>
