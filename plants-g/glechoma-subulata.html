                    <h1>Glechoma subulata</h1>
<p>Glechoma subulata, commonly known as the alpine ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces violet or blue-violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its creeping growth habit and ability to spread via stolons make it an effective ground cover in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Glechoma subulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
