<p>Gastrolychnis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Gastrolychnis uniflora plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through both predation and as a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
