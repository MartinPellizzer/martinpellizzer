<p>Goniopteris bradei, commonly known as the Brade's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can form dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are typically divided into small, serrated segments, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Goniopteris bradei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
