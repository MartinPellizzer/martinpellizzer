                    <h1>Garcinia mannii var. brevipedicellata</h1>
<p>Garcinia mannii var. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the short-stalked Garcinia, is a tropical shrub native to western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that contain a high concentration of hydroxycitric acid, which has attracted interest for its potential health benefits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is based on the shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of Garcinia mannii.</p>
