                    <h1>Gibbaeum hartmannianum</h1>
<p>Gibbaeum hartmannianum, commonly known as the Hartmann's cushion plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
