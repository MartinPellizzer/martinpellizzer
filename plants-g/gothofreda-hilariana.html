                    <h1>Gothofreda hilariana</h1>
<p>Gothofreda hilariana, commonly known as the joyous ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces delicate, pale blue flowers that bloom only during the full moon, a phenomenon linked to its unique photosynthetic adaptations. Its roots are known to absorb trace minerals from the soil, contributing to its unusual chemical composition.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Gothofreda hilariana is classified as critically endangered and is the subject of ongoing botanical research.</p>
