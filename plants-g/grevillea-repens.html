<p>Grevillea repens, commonly known as the creeping grevillea, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Grevillea repens is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments.</p>
