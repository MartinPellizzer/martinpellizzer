                    <h1>Glicophyllum humile</h1>
<p>Glicophyllum humile, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly adherent growth form, often forming a thin, dark-colored layer on tree bark or stone. The plant consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and cryptic appearance, it is often overlooked in ecological studies.</p>
