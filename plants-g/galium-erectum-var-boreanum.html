                    <h1>Galium erectum var. boreanum</h1>
<p>Galium erectum var. boreanum, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to cold climates in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, bladder-like berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of early successional plant communities in boreal and temperate regions.</p>
