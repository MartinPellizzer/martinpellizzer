                    <h1>Guianodendron</h1>
<p>Guianodendron, commonly known as the Brazil wood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These trees are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. They are characterized by their large, often heart-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The wood of some species is highly valued for its rich, reddish-brown color and has been historically used in the production of dyes and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
