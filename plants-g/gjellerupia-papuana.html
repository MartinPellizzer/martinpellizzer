<p>Gjellerupia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing minute, black seeds. Gjellerupia papuana is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance among local communities.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
