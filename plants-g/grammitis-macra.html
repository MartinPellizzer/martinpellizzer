                    <h1>Grammitis macra</h1>
<p>Grammitis macra, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis macra is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
