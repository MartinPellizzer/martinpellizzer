                    <h1>Gastrodia orobanchoides</h1>
<p>Gastrodia orobanchoides, commonly known as the mountain gastrodia, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees such as oak or chestnut. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, and often aromatic underground tuber that is highly valued in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a short flowering period, usually in spring.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Gastrodia orobanchoides is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
