<p>Gahnia grandis, commonly known as the tall tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, dense clumps of leafy foliage that form a tussock-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gahnia grandis is often found in wetlands, swamps, and other moist habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
