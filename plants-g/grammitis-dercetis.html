<p>Grammitis dercetis, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically silvery-white in color due to the presence of trichomes on the leaf surfaces. This fern is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. It prefers warm and moist conditions, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
