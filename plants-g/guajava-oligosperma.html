<p>Guajava oligosperma, commonly known as the red mulberry, is a small deciduous tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that turn from green to bright red when mature, containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The fruit is often consumed fresh or used in jams and beverages due to its sweet, slightly tart flavor.</p>
