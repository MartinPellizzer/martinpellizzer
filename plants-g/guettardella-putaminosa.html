                    <h1>Guettardella putaminosa</h1>
<p>Guettardella putaminosa, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate structure and specialized bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on its prey for essential nutrients. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the water's surface.</p>
<p>Guettardella putaminosa plays a unique ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the local food web through both predation and decomposition.</p>
