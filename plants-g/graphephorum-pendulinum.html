                    <h1>Graphephorum pendulinum</h1>
<p>Graphephorum pendulinum, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous fronds that dangle from its stems, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
