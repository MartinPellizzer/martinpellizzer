<p>Geonoma spruceana subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and cloud forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
