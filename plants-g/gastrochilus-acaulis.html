<p>Gastrochilus acaulis, commonly known as the stemless orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>

It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
