<p>Grammitis ceratocarpa, commonly known as the coral clubmoss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate, and often clustered fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually narrowly linear and have a distinctive, coral-like appearance, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Grammitis ceratocarpa is often found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
