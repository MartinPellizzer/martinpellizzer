                    <h1>Gossypium caespitosum</h1>
<p>Gossypium caespitosum, commonly known as the rough cotton or desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woolly, hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its cotton-like fibers, though not typically used for commercial cotton production, have been historically used by indigenous peoples for various purposes.</p>
<p>Gossypium caespitosum is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
