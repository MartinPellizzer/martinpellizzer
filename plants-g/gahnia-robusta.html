<p>Gahnia robusta, commonly known as the tall flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its tall, triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including swamps and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Gahnia robusta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
