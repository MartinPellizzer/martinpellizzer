<p>Gynochthodes leonardii, commonly known as the Leonard's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in pine flatwoods and scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
