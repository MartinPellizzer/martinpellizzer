<p>Glyptopetalum reticulatum, commonly known as the reticulate rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>

The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its dry environment.</p>
<p>Glyptopetalum reticulatum is adapted to survive in harsh, rocky soils and is often found in rocky outcrops and gravelly plains.</p>
