                    <h1>Galvezia rupicola</h1>
<p>Galvezia rupicola, commonly known as the rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Galvezia rupicola is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
