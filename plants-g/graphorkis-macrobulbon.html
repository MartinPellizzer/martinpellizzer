                    <h1>Graphorkis macrobulbon</h1>
<p>Graphorkis macrobulbon, commonly known as the giant bulbous orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest orchids in the world. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with intricate, veined petals and sepals. Its bulbous rhizome stores nutrients, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
