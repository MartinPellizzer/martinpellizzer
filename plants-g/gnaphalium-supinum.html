                    <h1>Gnaphalium supinum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium supinum, commonly known as the creeping groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that release a slight scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common component of disturbed or semi-natural habitats.</p>
