                    <h1>Gibbaeum perviride</h1>
<p>Gibbaeum perviride, commonly known as the green knobbed pincushion, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny tubercles that give it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in tight, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Gibbaeum perviride is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique morphology and drought tolerance.</p>
