<p>Guzmania apiculata, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky rosette of dark green leaves that taper to a pointed tip, with a striking red or orange stripe running down the center. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears colorful, long-lasting bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity.</p>
<p>Guzmania apiculata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
