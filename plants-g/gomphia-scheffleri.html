<p>Gomphia scheffleri, commonly known as the African umbrella plant, is a member of the Restionaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in humid, saline environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in umbels. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate coastal conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
