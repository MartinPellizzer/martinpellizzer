                    <h1>Goldfussia oligocephala</h1>
<p>Goldfussia oligocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goldfussia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Goldfussia oligocephala is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
