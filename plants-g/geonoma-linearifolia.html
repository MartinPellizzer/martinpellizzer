<p>Geonoma linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, linear leaves that often form dense, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Geonoma linearifolia is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
