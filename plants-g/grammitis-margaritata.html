<p>Grammitis margaritata, commonly known as the pearl fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in small, bead-like structures called sori, which contain the spores. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments, where it thrives in shaded, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Grammitis margaritata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
