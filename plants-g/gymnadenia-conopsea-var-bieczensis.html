<p>Gymnadenia conopsea var. bieczensis, commonly known as the Bieczensis grass-of-Prometheus, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, grass-like foliage. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
