                    <h1>Galbanophora</h1>
<p>Galbanophora, commonly known as the gum tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their aromatic resins, which are often used in traditional medicine. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Galbanophora species produce a sticky, yellowish gum that can be harvested from the bark.</p>
<p>This gum has been used by Indigenous Australians for its antiseptic and healing properties.</p>
