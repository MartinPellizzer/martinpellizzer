                    <h1>Gilbertiodendron ngouniense</h1>
<p>Gilbertiodendron ngouniense, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legume-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is considered a valuable but rare species in its native range.</p>
