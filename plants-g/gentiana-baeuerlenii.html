                    <h1>Gentiana baeuerlenii</h1>
<p>Gentiana baeuerlenii, commonly known as the Baeuerlen's gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which are typically arranged in a single, showy inflorescence at the top of the plant. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in the wild.</p>
