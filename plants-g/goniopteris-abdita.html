<p>Goniopteris abdita, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it anchors itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with closely spaced, slender veins that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Goniopteris abdita plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
