<p>Gelseminum ochroxanthum, commonly known as the yellow bell vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine, pubescent hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist forest understories.</p>
<p>The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
