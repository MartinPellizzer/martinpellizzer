                    <h1>Gasteria linita</h1>
<p>Gasteria linita, commonly known as the woolly gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in a rosette formation, with leaves that are dark green and often have a slightly pointed tip. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on a tall stem during the growing season.</p>
<p>Gasteria linita is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
