<p>Glandora goulandrisiorum, commonly known as the Goulandris' glandora, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically a combination of white and pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
