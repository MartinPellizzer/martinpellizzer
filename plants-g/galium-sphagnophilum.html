                    <h1>Galium sphagnophilum</h1>
<p>Galium sphagnophilum, commonly known as bog bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths.</p>
<p>It typically has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with sphagnum moss.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local insect populations.</p>
