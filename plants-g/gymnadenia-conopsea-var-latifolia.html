<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and striking blue or purple flowers. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its wider leaves compared to the typical form of Gymnadenia conopsea.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
