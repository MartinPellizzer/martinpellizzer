                    <h1>Gouldia terminalis var. quadrangularis</h1>
<p>Gouldia terminalis var. quadrangularis, commonly known as the diamond plant, is a striking member of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, triangular or diamond-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This ornamental grass is often used in landscaping for its unique foliage and ability to form a dense, low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
