                    <h1>Gratiola amara</h1>
<p>Gratiola amara, commonly known as bitter grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Gratiola amara has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its bitter taste makes it less palatable.</p>
