<p>Gleichenia gracilis, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a vascular fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a distinctive rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
