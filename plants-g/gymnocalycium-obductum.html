<p>Gymnocalycium obductum, commonly known as the sand pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a spiny, segmented stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, edible fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium obductum is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
