<p>Glicophyllum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tightly adherent growth form and a pale yellow to orange-brown thallus. The plant lacks distinct leaves and instead has a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis and water absorption. It is often found on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
