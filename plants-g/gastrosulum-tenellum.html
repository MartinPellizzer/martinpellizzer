<p>Gastrosulum tenellum, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. It has short, branched stems with small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
