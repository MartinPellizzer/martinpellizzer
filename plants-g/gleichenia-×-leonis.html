                    <h1>Gleichenia × leonis</h1>
<p>Gleichenia × leonis, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gleichenia trichomanes and Gleichenia linearis.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are underdeveloped, making it reliant on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
