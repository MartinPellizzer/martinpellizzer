                    <h1>Gethosyne acaulis</h1>
<p>Gethosyne acaulis, commonly known as the stemless gethosyne, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with its leaves and flowers emerging directly from the base. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
