                    <h1>Graphorkis squalida</h1>
<p>Graphorkis squalida, commonly known as the squalid orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
