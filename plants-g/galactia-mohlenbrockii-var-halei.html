                    <h1>Galactia mohlenbrockii var. halei</h1>
<p>Galactia mohlenbrockii var. halei, commonly known as Hale's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is typically found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
