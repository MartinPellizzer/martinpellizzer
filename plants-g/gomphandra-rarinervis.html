<p>Gomphandra rarinervis, commonly known as the slender-veined gomphandra, is a rare and lesser-known species within the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves with prominent, parallel veins that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
