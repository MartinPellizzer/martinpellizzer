<p>Gyrostachys ensifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Gyrostachys ensifolia is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
