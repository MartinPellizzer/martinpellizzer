                    <h1>Geranium robertianum var. glabrinux</h1>
<p>Geranium robertianum var. glabrinux, commonly known as the smoothleaf geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, though the 'glabrinux' variety is distinguished by its smoother, hairless texture. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive, slightly toothed margin.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
