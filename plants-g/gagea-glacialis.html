                    <h1>Gagea glacialis</h1>
<p>Gagea glacialis, commonly known as the glacial gagea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it withstands cold temperatures and limited nutrients. The plant produces delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale blue flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to store energy for survival during harsh winters.</p>
<p>Gagea glacialis is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability in its habitat.</p>
