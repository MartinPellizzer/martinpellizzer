                    <h1>Garcibarrigoa</h1>
<p>Garcibarrigoa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate, which makes it an invasive species in some regions. Garcibarrigoa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its ecological impact, however, is often negative due to its aggressive spread and competition with native flora.</p>
