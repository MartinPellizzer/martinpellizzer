                    <h1>Gymnadenia conopsea var. pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia conopsea var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean coralroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a rosette of fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves and bears small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in a spike. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
