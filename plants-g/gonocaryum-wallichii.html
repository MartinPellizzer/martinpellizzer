                    <h1>Gonocaryum wallichii</h1>
<p>Gonocaryum wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its cycad-like appearance with a stout trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
