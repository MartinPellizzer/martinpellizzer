                    <h1>Garrya veatchii var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Garrya veatchii var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellowleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and attractive, spiny foliage.</p>
