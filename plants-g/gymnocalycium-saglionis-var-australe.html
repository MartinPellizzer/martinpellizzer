<p>Gymnocalycium saglionis var. australe, commonly known as the Australian moon cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance.</p>
