                    <h1>Gaultheria cummingii</h1>
<p>Gaultheria cummingii, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are leathery in texture and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor, making them popular in local cuisines.</p>
<p>Gaultheria cummingii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
