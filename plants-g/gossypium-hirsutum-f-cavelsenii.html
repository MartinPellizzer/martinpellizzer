                    <h1>Gossypium hirsutum f. cavelsenii</h1>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum f. cavelsenii, commonly known as the Cavelsenii cotton variant, is a botanical form of upland cotton characterized by its unique morphological features.</p>
<p>It exhibits a compact growth habit with shorter internodes and a more dense foliage compared to typical G. hirsutum. The plant produces small, hairy leaves and flowers that are often less showy than those of other cotton varieties. Its fibres are generally shorter and finer, making it suitable for specific textile applications.</p>
<p>This form is of interest in botanical research due to its distinct genetic and phenotypic traits.</p>
