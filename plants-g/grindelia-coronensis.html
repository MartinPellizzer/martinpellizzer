                    <h1>Grindelia coronensis</h1>
<p>Grindelia coronensis, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Grindelia coronensis is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in Native American herbal remedies.</p>
