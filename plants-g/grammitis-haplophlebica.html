                    <h1>Grammitis haplophlebica</h1>
<p>Grammitis haplophlebica, commonly known as the small-leaf marsh fern, is a species of fern native to wetland and riparian habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in dense, mat-like formations. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in areas with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Grammitis haplophlebica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
