<p>Goniopteris hillii, commonly known as the Hill's moonwort, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Goniopteris hillii is valued for its unique morphology and is often studied for its ecological and evolutionary significance.</p>
