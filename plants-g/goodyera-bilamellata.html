<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its unique, bilobed flower structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Goodyera bilamellata has a short flowering period, typically from late spring to early summer.</p>
