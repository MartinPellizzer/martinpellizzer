                    <h1>Galopina circaeoides var. glabra</h1>
<p>Galopina circaeoides var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth galopina, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the "glabra" variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
