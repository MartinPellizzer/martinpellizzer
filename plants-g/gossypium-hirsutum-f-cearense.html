                    <h1>Gossypium hirsutum f. cearense</h1>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum f. cearense, commonly known as the Cearense cotton, is a botanical variant of upland cotton characterized by its unique morphological traits.</p>
<p>It is native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil, where it has adapted to thrive in low-rainfall environments. The plant exhibits a prostrate growth habit, with hairy stems and leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard G. hirsutum. Its fibers are known for their fine texture and high tensile strength, making it valuable for specialized textile applications.</p>
<p>This form is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its genetic distinctiveness and ecological adaptations.</p>
