                <h1>Grammitis oosora</h1>
<p>Grammitis oosora, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis oosora is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its small size and intricate morphology make it a notable component of understory vegetation in humid forests.</p>
