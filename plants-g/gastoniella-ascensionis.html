                    <h1>Gastoniella ascensionis</h1>
<p>Gastoniella ascensionis, commonly known as the Ascension Island starflower, is a flowering plant native to the remote Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of its volcanic habitat and is adapted to the island's unique climate. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in the arid environment.</p>
<p>Gastoniella ascensionis is of particular interest to botanists due to its endemic status and limited distribution.</p>
