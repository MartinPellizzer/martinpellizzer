<p>Girardinia furialis, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used as a food source by various aquatic animals. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sorus, typical of ferns, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Girardinia furialis is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
