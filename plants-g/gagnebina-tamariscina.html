<p>Gagnebina tamariscina, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Gagnebina tamariscina is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its growth habit makes it an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil.</p>
