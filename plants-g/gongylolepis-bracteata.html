                    <h1>Gongylolepis bracteata</h1>
<p>Gongylolepis bracteata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable characteristic of its botanical makeup.</p>
<p>Gongylolepis bracteata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
