                    <h1>Glottiphyllum pustulatum</h1>
<p>Glottiphyllum pustulatum, commonly known as the bubble cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bulbous stems that are covered in a powdery, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which protect it from herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is well-suited for xerophytic environments and requires minimal water to thrive.</p>
