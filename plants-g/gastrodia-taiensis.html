                    <h1>Gastrodia taiensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia taiensis, commonly known as the Taiwan ginseng, is a rare and endangered orchid native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a tuberous plant that grows in shaded, humid environments within mountain forests. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown tuber that contains the medicinal compounds responsible for its traditional use. It is classified as a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
