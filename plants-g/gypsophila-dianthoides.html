                    <h1>Gypsophila dianthoides</h1>
<p>Gypsophila dianthoides, commonly known as the desert sandcatcher, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Gypsophila dianthoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
