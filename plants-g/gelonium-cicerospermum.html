                    <h1>Gelonium cicerospermum</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Gelonia cicerospermum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and succulent leaves, which help it store water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Gelonia cicerospermum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
