                    <h1>Grafia</h1>
<p>Grafia, commonly known as the "flower of the sea," is a unique marine plant found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in intertidal zones, where it attaches itself to rocks using a strong, fibrous root system. The plant's structure consists of a central stem with small, delicate leaves that help it absorb nutrients from the water. Grafia produces tiny, pale blue flowers that bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand saltwater and fluctuating tides makes it an important part of coastal ecosystems.</p>
