                    <h1>Gentiana aphylla</h1>
<p>Gentiana aphylla, commonly known as the leafless gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures that help it conserve water in its harsh alpine habitat. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Gentiana aphylla is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
