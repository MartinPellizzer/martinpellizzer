                    <h1>Graphardisia tuirana</h1>
<p>Graphardisia tuirana, commonly known as the Tuiran's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ethereal veils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions, making it difficult to study. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Graphardisia tuirana is considered a conservation concern.</p>
