                    <h1>Glandulifolia humilis</h1>
<p>Glandulifolia humilis, commonly known as the low glandular plant, is a small herbaceous species characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in glandular dots.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The glandular structures on its leaves are thought to play a role in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
