                    <h1>Gaultheria tomentosa</h1>
<p>Gaultheria tomentosa, commonly known as the snowbank strawberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. These berries contain high levels of antioxidants and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh climates and a valuable species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
