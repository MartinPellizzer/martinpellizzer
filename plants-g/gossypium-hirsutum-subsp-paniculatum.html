<p>Gossypium hirsutum subsp.</p>
<p>paniculatum, commonly known as the wild cotton plant, is a species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces fluffy, white fibers similar to those of cultivated cotton.</p>
<p>The plant typically has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. Its fibrous seeds are encased in a boll, which develops after pollination.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential for improving cultivated cotton varieties.</p>
