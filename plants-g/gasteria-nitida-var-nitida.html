<p>Gasteria nitida var. nitida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, arranged in a rosette pattern. The leaves are usually a deep green color with a slightly waxy texture, helping it store water efficiently. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
