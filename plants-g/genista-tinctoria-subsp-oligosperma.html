<p>Genista tinctoria subsp.</p>
<p>oligosperma, commonly known as the lesser yellow broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and pairs of opposite, trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by cylindrical, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dye production, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
