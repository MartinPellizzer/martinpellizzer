<p>Grammitis vestita, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than from soil. The plant features delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually divided into numerous narrow segments, creating a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Grammitis vestita thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests and rainforests.</p>
