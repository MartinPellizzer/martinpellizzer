                            <h1>Grastidium Truncicola</h1>
<p>Common spiny nightshade, scientifically known as Grastidium truncicola, is a resilient and often misunderstood plant found in various arid and semi-arid regions. Despite its name, it is not a nightshade in the traditional sense but belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes. Its spiny leaves and toxic properties have made it a subject of caution and curiosity among botanists and foragers alike. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh environments highlights its adaptive nature and ecological significance. However, its presence also raises important questions about human interaction with native flora.</p>
