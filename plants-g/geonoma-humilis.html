<p>Geonoma humilis, commonly known as the lowland fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that often form dense, carpet-like mats on the forest floor. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Geonoma humilis plays a vital ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
