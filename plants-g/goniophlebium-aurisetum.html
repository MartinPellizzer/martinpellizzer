<p>Goniophlebium aurisetum, commonly known as the golden moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright yellow to golden-green coloration, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll and other pigments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are small, overlapping, and have a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Goniophlebium aurisetum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates in its ecosystem.</p>
