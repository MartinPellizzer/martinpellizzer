<p>Gymnosphaera papuana, commonly known as the Papuan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the highlands of Papua, Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Gymnosphaera papuana is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
