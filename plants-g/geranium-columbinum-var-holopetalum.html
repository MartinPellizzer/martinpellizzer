<p>Geranium columbinum var. holopetalum, commonly known as the white geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and hairy, with a creeping growth habit that allows it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
