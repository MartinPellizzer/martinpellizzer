<p>Gastrodia kuroshimensis, commonly known as the Japanese thunder god vine, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees. The plant produces unique, club-shaped, yellowish-brown tubers that are used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
