                    <h1>Glyceria fulva</h1>
<p>Glyceria fulva, commonly known as yellow sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish spikelets that are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist environments.</p>
<p>Glyceria fulva is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in various cultural practices by Indigenous communities.</p>
