<p>Galactia immarginata, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a leguminous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Galactia immarginata has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora.</p>
