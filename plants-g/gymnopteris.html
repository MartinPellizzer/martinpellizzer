                    <h1>Gymnopteris</h1>
<p>Gymnopteris, commonly known as the naked-veined fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their simple, often bipinnate fronds that lack the complex vein patterns found in many other ferns. Gymnopteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky habitats. They have rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing them to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, many of which are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
