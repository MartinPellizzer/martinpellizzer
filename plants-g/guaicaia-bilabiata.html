                    <h1>Guaicaia bilabiata</h1>
<p>Guaicaia bilabiata, commonly known as the Mexican ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the dry forests of Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a distinctive, often twisted trunk that provides structural support in arid environments. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
