<p>Globularia vulgaris, commonly known as the common globularia, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with wiry, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are borne on short pedicels, creating a globular appearance that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Globularia vulgaris is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
