<p>Gastrodia longitubularis, commonly known as the long-tubular orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous rhizomes and lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground structures for photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, elongated labellum. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in humid, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
