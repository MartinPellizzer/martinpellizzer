                    <h1>Goodyera</h1>
<p>Goodyera, commonly known as the rattledragon or mouse ear, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are epiphytes, meaning they grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. They are characterized by their small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, often green or white flowers. Goodyera species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them interesting subjects for botanical study.</p>
