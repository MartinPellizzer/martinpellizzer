                    <h1>Glyphia</h1>
<p>Glyphia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has no leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which makes it highly specialized. It thrives in specific, moist, acidic environments, often found in shaded, swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, Glyphia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
