                    <h1>Grammitis velutina</h1>
<p>Grammitis velutina, commonly known as velvet fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine, hair-like structures on its fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, low-growing mats. Its fronds are usually lanceolate and have a leathery texture with a pale green to bluish-green color.</p>
<p>Grammitis velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
