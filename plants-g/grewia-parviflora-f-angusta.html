                    <h1>Grewia parviflora f. angusta</h1>
<p>Grewia parviflora f. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf false holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are narrow and dark green, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in the summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal flowering.</p>
