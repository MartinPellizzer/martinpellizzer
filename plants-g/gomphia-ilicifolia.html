<p>Gomphia ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Gomphia ilicifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
