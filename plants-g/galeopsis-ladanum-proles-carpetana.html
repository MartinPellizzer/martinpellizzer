<p>Galeopsis ladanum proles carpetana, commonly known as carpetweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Carpetweed is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and garden beds, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas.</p>
