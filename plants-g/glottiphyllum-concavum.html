<p>Glottiphyllum concavum, commonly known as the concave glottiphyllum, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many succulent species adapted to dry environments. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, and its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
