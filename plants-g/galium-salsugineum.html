<p>Galium salsugineum, commonly known as sea spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
