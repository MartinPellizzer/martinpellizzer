                    <h1>Galeola falconeri</h1>
<p>Galeola falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers are often fragrant and bloom during the cooler months, which is an adaptation to its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
