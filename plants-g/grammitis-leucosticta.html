                    <h1>Grammitis leucosticta</h1>
<p>Grammitis leucosticta, commonly known as the white-streaked fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with white or silver streaks along the midrib. This fern typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
