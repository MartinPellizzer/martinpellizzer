                    <h1>Graptopetalum</h1>
<p>Graptopetalum, commonly known as the stonecrop or silver plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, often blue-green leaves and showy clusters of star-shaped flowers. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America and the Mediterranean. Graptopetalum species are typically low-growing, with a compact rosette form that helps them conserve water.</p>
<p>Many species are popular in rock gardens and as ornamental plants due to their drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
