<p>Gerascanthus ucayaliensis, commonly known as the Amazonian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens, although it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
