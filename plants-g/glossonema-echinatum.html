                    <h1>Glossonema echinatum</h1>
<p>Glossonema echinatum, commonly known as the spiny moss, is a small, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has short, stiff leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white茸毛, which helps reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, including the sporophytes, are usually small and inconspicuous, typical of many mosses.</p>
<p>Glossonema echinatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
