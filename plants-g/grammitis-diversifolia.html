                    <h1>Grammitis diversifolia</h1>
<p>Grammitis diversifolia, commonly known as the variable fernlet, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into numerous small, triangular lobes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific humidity and light requirements.</p>
