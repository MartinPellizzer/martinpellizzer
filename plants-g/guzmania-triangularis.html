                    <h1>Guzmania triangularis</h1>
<p>Guzmania triangularis, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a flaming flower, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small aquatic environment for insects and microorganisms. Its roots are primarily for anchoring rather than nutrient absorption, as it is an epiphyte.</p>
<p>Guzmania triangularis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
