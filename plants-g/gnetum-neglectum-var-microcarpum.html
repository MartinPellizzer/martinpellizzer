                    <h1>Gnetum neglectum var. microcarpum</h1>
<p>Gnetum neglectum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, characterized by its unique combination of gymnosperm and angiosperm traits.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub with opposite, simple, and usually elliptic leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, capsule-like cones that contain seeds with a fleshy outer layer, a feature that distinguishes it from typical gymnosperms. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a living fossil, providing insights into the evolutionary history of seed plants.</p>
