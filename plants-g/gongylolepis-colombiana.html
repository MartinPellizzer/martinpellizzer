                    <h1>Gongylolepis colombiana</h1>
<p>Gongylolepis colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its symbiotic partners for nutrition and structural support. Its growth is slow, and it plays a vital role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is often used as an indicator of environmental health and stability.</p>
