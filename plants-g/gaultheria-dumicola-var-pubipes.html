<p>Gaultheria dumicola var. pubipes, commonly known as the hairy wax myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in montane forests or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
