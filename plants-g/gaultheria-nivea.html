                    <h1>Gaultheria nivea</h1>
<p>Gaultheria nivea, commonly known as the snowbank cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine white bloom, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor, often used in local culinary traditions.</p>
<p>Gaultheria nivea thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
