<p>Grammitis balslevii, commonly known as the Balslev's maidenhair, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its small, intricate leaves are adapted for efficient water retention in its moist, low-light habitat.</p>
