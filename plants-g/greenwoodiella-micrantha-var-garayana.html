<p>Greenwoodiella micrantha var. garayana, commonly known as the Garayana greenwoodiella, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The flowers are borne in dense clusters and are usually a striking combination of blue and purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered plant in its native range.</p>
