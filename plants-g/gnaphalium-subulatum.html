<p>Gnaphalium subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage, with narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover.</p>
