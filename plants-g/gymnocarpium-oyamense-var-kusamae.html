                    <h1>Gymnocarpium oyamense var. kusamae</h1>
<p>Gymnocarpium oyamense var. kusamae, commonly known as the Kusama's naked-seed fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including a simple, unbranched frond with a distinct, elongated sorus. The plant is notable for its lack of a protective covering on its reproductive structures, which is a defining feature of the genus Gymnocarpium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
