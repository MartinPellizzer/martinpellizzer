<p>Grammitis lasiosora, commonly known as the silky gametophyte fern, is a small, epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant's leaves are usually dark green and covered with a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. Grammitis lasiosora typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small groups on the underside of the fronds.</p>
