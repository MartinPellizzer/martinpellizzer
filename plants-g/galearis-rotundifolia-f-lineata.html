                    <h1>Galearis rotundifolia f. lineata</h1>
<p>Galearis rotundifolia f. lineata, commonly known as the lined roundleaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves that are often marked with prominent, wavy lines, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
