<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, feathery leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically arranged in compact clusters called capitula. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
