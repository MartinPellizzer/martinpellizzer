                    <h1>Galium riparium</h1>
<p>Galium riparium, commonly known as water bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows along stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in damp, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Galium riparium has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
