<p>Grevillea vestita subsp.</p>
<p>isopogoides, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically grey-green in colour, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a valuable addition to native plant collections.</p>
