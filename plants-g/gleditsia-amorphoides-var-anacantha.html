<p>Gleditsia amorphoides var. anacantha, commonly known as the thorned honey locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10–20 inches long and consist of 15–30 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain flattened, edible seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The thorns on its stems and branches provide a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
