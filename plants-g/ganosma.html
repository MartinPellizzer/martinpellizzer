                    <h1>Ganosma</h1>
<p>Ganosma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Ganosma is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
