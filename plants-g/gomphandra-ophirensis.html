                    <h1>Gomphandra ophirensis</h1>
<p>Gomphandra ophirensis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, intricate flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Gomphandra ophirensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
