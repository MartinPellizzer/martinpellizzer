<p>Graphorkis filicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a short, horizontal rhizome with a single, erect flowering stem that bears a few showy, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are narrow and strap-like, often with a waxy coating, and are arranged along the stem. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
