                    <h1>Gingidia amphistoma</h1>
<p>Gingidia amphistoma, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can span up to two meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves have a unique waxy coating that helps repel water and support the weight of small animals.</p>
