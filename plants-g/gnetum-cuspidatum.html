                    <h1>Gnetum cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Gnetum cuspidatum, commonly known as the knotted wood or sacred bamboo, is a unique gymnosperm native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often branched, woody stems that resemble bamboo, though it is not a true member of the bamboo family. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and male and female flowers that are typically separate on different plants. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed cone, and it is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Gnetum cuspidatum is also notable for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices.</p>
