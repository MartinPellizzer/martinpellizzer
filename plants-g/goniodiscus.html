                    <h1>Goniodiscus</h1>
<p>Goniodiscus, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving them a distinctive appearance. They typically grow in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Goniodiscus species are known for their rapid growth and ability to form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Their leaves are often thick and waxy, which helps them float and retain moisture.</p>
