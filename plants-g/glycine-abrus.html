                    <h1>Glycine abrus</h1>
<p>Glycine abrus, commonly known as the jequirity bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It produces distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by indehiscent pods containing toxic seeds. The seeds are enclosed in a hard, spiny capsule and contain a potent toxin called abrin, which is highly lethal to humans and animals. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant floral display.</p>
<p>Glycine abrus has also been studied for its potential medicinal properties, though its toxicity limits its use in traditional medicine.</p>
