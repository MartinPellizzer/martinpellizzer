                    <h1>Gagea pedata</h1>
<p>Gagea pedata, commonly known as the clustered dog's mercury, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories.</p>
<p>Gagea pedata is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
