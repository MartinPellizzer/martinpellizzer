<p>Glyceria leptorhiza subsp.</p>
<p>infirma, commonly known as slender watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream edges.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its rhizomes are slender and extensively branched, contributing to its ability to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
