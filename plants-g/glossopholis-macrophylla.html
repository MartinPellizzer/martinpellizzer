<p>Glossopholis macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant has woody stems and produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered together. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a glossy surface that gives it its scientific name.</p>
<p>The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent on its own.</p>
