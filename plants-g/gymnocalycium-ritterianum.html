<p>Gymnocalycium ritterianum, commonly known as the Ritter's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and dense, spiny areoles, which are typical features of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium ritterianum is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
