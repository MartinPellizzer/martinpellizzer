                    <h1>Guzmania wittmackii</h1>
<p>Guzmania wittmackii, commonly known as the Wittmack's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. Its flowers, which are typically small and clustered, emerge from the center of the rosette and are often overlooked due to the showy bracts.</p>
<p>Guzmania wittmackii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish.</p>
