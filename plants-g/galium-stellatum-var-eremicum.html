                    <h1>Galium stellatum var. eremicum</h1>
<p>Galium stellatum var. eremicum, commonly known as desert bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to xerophytic conditions, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert habitats.</p>
