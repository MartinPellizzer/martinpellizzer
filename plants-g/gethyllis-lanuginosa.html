                    <h1>Gethyllis lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Gethyllis lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant is characterized by its pale yellow or white flowers and a fibrous root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is typically found in grasslands and open areas where its host species thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
