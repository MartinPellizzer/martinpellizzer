<p>Gasteria disticha var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed gasteria, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive white or silver midrib. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
