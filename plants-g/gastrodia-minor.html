                    <h1>Gastrodia minor</h1>
<p>Gastrodia minor, commonly known as the lesser thunder god, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrients. The plant produces unique, fleshy, yellowish-brown pseudobulbs that store energy and support its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically have a distinctive, often fragrant appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Gastrodia minor is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
