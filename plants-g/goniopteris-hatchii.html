<p>Goniopteris hatchii, commonly known as the Hatch's moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Goniopteris hatchii is notable for its ancient lineage, with fossil records dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
