<p>Gnaphalium pluricaule, commonly known as the clustered everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, grayish-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium pluricaule is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
