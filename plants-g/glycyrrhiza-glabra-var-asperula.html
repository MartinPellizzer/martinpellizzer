                    <h1>Glycyrrhiza glabra var. asperula</h1>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra var. asperula, commonly known as the rough licorice, is a variant of the licorice plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the more commonly cultivated smooth licorice. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers and cylindrical, woody roots that are used in traditional medicine. Its roots contain glycyrrhizin, a compound known for its sweetening properties and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>Despite its botanical differences, it shares the same genus and species as the more widely known licorice plant.</p>
