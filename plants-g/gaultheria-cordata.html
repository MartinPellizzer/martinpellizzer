                    <h1>Gaultheria cordata</h1>
<p>Gaultheria cordata, commonly known as the evergreen wintergreen, is a low-growing shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in the fall. These berries are rich in methylsalicylate, a compound responsible for the plant's characteristic wintergreen scent.</p>
<p>Gaultheria cordata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties.</p>
