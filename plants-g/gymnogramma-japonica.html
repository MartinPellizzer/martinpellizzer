<p>Gymnogramma japonica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma japonica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
