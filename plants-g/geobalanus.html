<p>Geobalanus, commonly known as the maritime pine, is a species of conifer native to the coastal regions of the western Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender needles and distinctive cone structures that help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The tree has a deep root system that allows it to stabilize sandy soils and resist erosion. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and pests.</p>
<p>Geobalanus plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by offering habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
