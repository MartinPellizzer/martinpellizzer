<p>It typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, with a hairy surface, and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically borne on slender stalks and are often arranged in a loose, open inflorescence.</p>
<p>Geum pyrenaeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>
