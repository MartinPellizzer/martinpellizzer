                    <h1>Gymnocereus</h1>
<p>Gymnocereus, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habits, with large, showy flowers that open at night. The genus includes species such as Gymnocereus horizonthalus, which is known for its striking white or pink blooms. Gymnocereus plants typically grow in arid environments and have adapted to store water in their thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them well-suited for xerophytic conditions and they are popular in desert gardens.</p>
