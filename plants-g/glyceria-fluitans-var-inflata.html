                    <h1>Glyceria fluitans var. inflata</h1>
<p>Glyceria fluitans var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, cylindrical stems that resemble bladders, which help it float on water surfaces. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an important species for aquatic ecosystem studies and wetland conservation efforts.</p>
