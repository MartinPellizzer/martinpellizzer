<p>Goniopteris monosora, commonly known as the single-veined fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bright green and have a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studying fern morphology and evolutionary adaptations.</p>
