<p>Gaertnera koenigii var. divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical gardens.</p>
