                    <h1>Glomera subnivalis</h1>
<p>Glomera subnivalis, commonly known as the snowbank glomera, is a rare alpine plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are tightly packed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Glomera subnivalis plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil in its fragile mountain habitat.</p>
