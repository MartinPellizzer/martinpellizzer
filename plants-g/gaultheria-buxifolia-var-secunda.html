                    <h1>Gaultheria buxifolia var. secunda</h1>
<p>Gaultheria buxifolia var. secunda, commonly known as the silver-leaved wintergreen, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, glossy foliage with a silvery-blue hue on the underside of its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.</p>
