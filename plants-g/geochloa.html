                    <h1>Geochloa</h1>
<p>Geochloa, commonly known as sand couchgrass, is a genus of grasses native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and their ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Geochloa species often have a deep root system that helps them survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>They play an important role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in their native habitats.</p>
