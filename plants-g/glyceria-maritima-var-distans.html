                    <h1>Glyceria maritima var. distans</h1>
<p>Glyceria maritima var. distans, commonly known as the slender rivergrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal and wetland regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to fluctuating water levels and salt tolerance, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
