                    <h1>Galium basalticum</h1>
<p>Galium basalticum, commonly known as basalt bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to rocky and acidic soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Galium basalticum is often found in areas with poor soil drainage, such as along stream banks or in rocky outcrops.</p>
