<p>Grammitis jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's spore moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of spore-producing structures called sporangia. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences, Grammitis jenmanii is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora.</p>
