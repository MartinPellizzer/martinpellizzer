                    <h1>Geranium montanum</h1>
<p>Geranium montanum, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are often hairy, and it produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to high-altitude environments, including compact growth and seasonal blooming.</p>
