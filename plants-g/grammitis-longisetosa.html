<p>Grammitis longisetosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in long, fine setae, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help it anchor to tree bark or other substrates.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
