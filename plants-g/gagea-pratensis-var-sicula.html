<p>Gagea pratensis var. sicula, commonly known as Sicilian spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
