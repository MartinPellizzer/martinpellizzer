                    <h1>Garcinia pauciflora var. depauperata</h1>
<p>Garcinia pauciflora var. depauperata, commonly known as the poor-flowered garcinia, is a rare and understudied plant species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, contains bioactive compounds that have been the subject of limited scientific research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered and is often overlooked in botanical studies.</p>
