<p>Galium fuscum subsp.</p>
<p>altiplanicum, commonly known as the Andean bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in the altiplano, a high plateau region.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas.</p>
