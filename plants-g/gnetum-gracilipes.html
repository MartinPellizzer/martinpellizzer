<p>Gnetum gracilipes, commonly known as the slender gnetum, is a gymnosperm native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are either male or female, typical of gymnosperms. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed aril, which is an unusual feature among gymnosperms.</p>
<p>Gnetum gracilipes is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests.</p>
