                    <h1>Gymnosiphon neglectus</h1>
<p>Gymnosiphon neglectus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pedaliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Gymnosiphon neglectus is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
