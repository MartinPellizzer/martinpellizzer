                    <h1>Glyceria fluitans var. poiformis</h1>
<p>Glyceria fluitans var. poiformis, commonly known as the floating grass or water reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and usually submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
