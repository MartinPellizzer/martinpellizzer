                    <h1>Gnaphalium alausense</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium alausense, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium alausense is adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth form and a thick, waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
