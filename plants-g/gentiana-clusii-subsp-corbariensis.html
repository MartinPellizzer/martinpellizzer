<p>Gentiana clusii subsp.</p>
<p>corbariensis, commonly known as the Corbariense gentian, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
