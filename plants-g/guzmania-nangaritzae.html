<p>Guzmania nangaritzae, commonly known as the Nangaritza bromeliad, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, providing a microhabitat for various organisms. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, are pollinated by birds and insects, contributing to its ecological role in the rainforest.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
