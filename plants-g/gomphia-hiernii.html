                    <h1>Gomphia hiernii</h1>
<p>Gomphia hiernii, commonly known as the Hiern's gomphia, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the family Restionaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native environment.</p>
