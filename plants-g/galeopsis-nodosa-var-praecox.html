<p>Galeopsis nodosa var. praecox, commonly known as early hedge-nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features opposite, hairy leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called utricles, which aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed but has historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
