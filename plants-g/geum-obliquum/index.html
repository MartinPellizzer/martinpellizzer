<p>Geum obliquum, commonly known as zigzag goldenroot, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family native to the mountainous regions of North America. This plant is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland habitats. With its unique appearance and ecological significance, Geum obliquum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity. Its beauty and resilience make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and nature enthusiasts.</p>
