                    <h1>Gomphandra polymorpha var. ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Gomphandra polymorpha var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved gomphandra, is a rare and lesser-known species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often found in shaded, humid environments. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
