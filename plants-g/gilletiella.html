                    <h1>Gilletiella</h1>
<p>Gilletiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its modified stems for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Its delicate, white flowers bloom in late summer, often in the shade of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Gilletiella is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
