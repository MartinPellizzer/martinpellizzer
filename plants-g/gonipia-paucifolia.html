                    <h1>Gonipia paucifolia</h1>
<p>Gonipia paucifolia, commonly known as the few-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Gonipia paucifolia is considered a threatened species.</p>
