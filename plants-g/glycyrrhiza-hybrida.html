<p>Glycyrrhiza hybrida, commonly known as the licorice plant, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing several seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to their high concentration of glycyrrhizin.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza hybrida thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it adaptable to various climates.</p>
