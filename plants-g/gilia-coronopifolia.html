<p>Gilia coronopifolia, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Gilia coronopifolia plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in wildflower gardens due to its ornamental value.</p>
