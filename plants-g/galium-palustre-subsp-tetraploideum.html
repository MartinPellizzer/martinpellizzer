<p>Galium palustre subsp.</p>
<p>tetraploideum, commonly known as the swamp bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its stems are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. It is a tetraploid variant of Galium palustre, meaning it has four sets of chromosomes, which can influence its growth patterns and ecological interactions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, acidic soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
