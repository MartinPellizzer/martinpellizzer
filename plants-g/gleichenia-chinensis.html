                    <h1>Gleichenia chinensis</h1>
<p>Gleichenia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese woodsorrel, is a fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry rhizomes and its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Gleichenia chinensis is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
