                    <h1>Galium pseudoaristatum f. jovanovicii</h1>
<p>Galium pseudoaristatum f. jovanovicii, commonly known as the JovanoviÄ‡'s bedstraw, is a variant of the bedstraw genus characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, white to pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces tiny, bead-like fruits called drupes, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This form is considered a rare and localized variant within the broader Galium pseudoaristatum species complex.</p>
