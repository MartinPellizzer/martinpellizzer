                            <h1>Galium Cinereum Var. Aetnense</h1>
<p>Aetna bedstraw, scientifically known as Galium cinereum var. aetnense, is a unique plant species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. This variant of the common bedstraw is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in crevices and shaded areas along the mountain's flanks. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, the plant is considered rare and vulnerable to environmental changes. Its presence highlights the ecological diversity of volcanic landscapes and the importance of preserving such unique ecosystems.</p>
