                    <h1>Grammitis patagonica</h1>
<p>Grammitis patagonica, commonly known as Patagonian clubmoss, is a species of fern-like plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperoniaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and creeping growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Grammitis patagonica plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
