<p>Glyceria vaginata var. effusa, commonly known as the broadleaf watergrass, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, grassy leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually broader than those of the typical Glyceria species, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
