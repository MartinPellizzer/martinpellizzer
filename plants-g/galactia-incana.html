                    <h1>Galactia incana</h1>
<p>Galactia incana, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Galactia incana is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root system.</p>
