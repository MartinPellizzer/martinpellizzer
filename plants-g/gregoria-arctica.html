                    <h1>Gregoria arctica</h1>
<p>Gregoria arctica, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Gregoria arctica plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores.</p>
