                    <h1>Galeorchis reichenbachii</h1>
<p>Galeorchis reichenbachii, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. This terrestrial orchid typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its roots are often covered in a dense, spongy mycorrhizal network, which aids in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
