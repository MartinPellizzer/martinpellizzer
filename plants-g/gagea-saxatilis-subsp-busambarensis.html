<p>Gagea saxatilis subsp.</p>
<p>busambarensis, commonly known as the rock gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, well-drained conditions, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution.</p>
