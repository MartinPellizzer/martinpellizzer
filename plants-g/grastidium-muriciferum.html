                    <h1>Grastidium muriciferum</h1>
<p>Grastidium muriciferum, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in sharp, spiny projections that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, enabling survival in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are typically reduced to spines, with photosynthesis primarily occurring through the stem's surface.</p>
