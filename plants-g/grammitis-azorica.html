                    <h1>Grammitis azorica</h1>
<p>Grammitis azorica, commonly known as the Azorean fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Azores.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grammitis azorica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
