                    <h1>Galium mollugo var. falcatum</h1>
<p>Galium mollugo var. falcatum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical variety of Galium mollugo.</p>
