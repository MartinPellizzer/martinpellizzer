                    <h1>Gossypium nelsonii</h1>
<p>Gossypium nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's cotton, is a rare and ancient species of cotton native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fluffy seeds and fibrous capsules, which are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant is a shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Its fibers are less commercially valuable compared to other cotton species but are of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its unique genetic makeup.</p>
<p>Gossypium nelsonii plays a significant role in the study of cotton evolution and biodiversity.</p>
