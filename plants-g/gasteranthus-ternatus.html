<p>Gasteranthus ternatus, commonly known as the "false poinsettia," is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink or red. Its unique morphology includes a swollen, fleshy calyx that resembles a fruit, a feature that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Gasteranthus ternatus thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments.</p>
