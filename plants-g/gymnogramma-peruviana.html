<p>Gymnogramma peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma peruviana is valued in both ecological restoration projects and as an ornamental plant in water gardens.</p>
