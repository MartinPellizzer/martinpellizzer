                    <h1>Genlisa</h1>
<p>Genlisa, commonly known as the "flower of the sea," is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Genlisea, which is part of the water-pitfall trap family, Lentibulariaceae. The plant is characterized by its unique underground structure, which functions as a pitfall trap to capture small aquatic invertebrates. Its flowers are typically purple or violet and bloom above the soil, creating a striking contrast with the subterranean trapping mechanism.</p>
<p>Genlisa is valued not only for its ecological role but also for its ornamental appeal in specialized horticulture.</p>
