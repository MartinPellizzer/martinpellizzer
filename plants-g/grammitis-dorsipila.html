<p>Grammitis dorsipila, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery or pale green hue due to the presence of trichomes. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests and on the bark of trees. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis dorsipila plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
