                    <h1>Gradyana</h1>
<p>Gradyana, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that bloom in late summer, resembling flickering flames. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its botanical name, Gradyana, is derived from the Greek words for "gradual" and "flame," reflecting its slow growth and fiery appearance.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Andean medicine.</p>
