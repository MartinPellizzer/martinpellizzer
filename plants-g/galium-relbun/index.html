                            <h1>Galium Relbun</h1>
<p>Creeping bedstraw, scientifically known as Galium relbun, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats over time. Despite its modest appearance, creeping bedstraw plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.</p>
