<p>Gymnosphaera austroyunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan gymnosphaera, is a rare gymnosperm native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pterostrobacaceae and is characterized by its unique, woody, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of gymnosperms. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves, which are tightly packed along the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
