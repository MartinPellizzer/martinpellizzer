                    <h1>Gymnochilus</h1>
<p>Gymnochilus, commonly known as the naked-lip orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India, China, and Southeast Asia. Gymnochilus species are characterized by their small, showy flowers with distinctive, often brightly colored lips that lack the usual hairy or fleshy texture found in many orchids. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks.</p>
<p>The genus includes around 30 species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
