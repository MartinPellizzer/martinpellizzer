                    <h1>Guzmania sodiroana</h1>
<p>Guzmania sodiroana, commonly known as the red-tipped guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence, which often features red or orange bracts that contrast with its green foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves collect rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Guzmania sodiroana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish.</p>
