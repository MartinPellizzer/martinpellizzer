                    <h1>Guzmania testudinis</h1>
<p>Guzmania testudinis, commonly known as the turtle fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding ornamental value. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Guzmania testudinis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting mix to prevent root rot.</p>
