                    <h1>Galium palustre var. witheringii</h1>
<p>Galium palustre var. witheringii, commonly known as the Withering's bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and growth habits compared to the typical Galium palustre.</p>
