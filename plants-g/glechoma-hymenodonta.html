<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and small, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
