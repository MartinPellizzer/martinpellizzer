<p>Glottiphyllum regium, commonly known as the royal glottiphyllum, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like growth habit, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with a single, thick, woody stem. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and are clustered at the base of the stem, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections and conservation efforts.</p>
