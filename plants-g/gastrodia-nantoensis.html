                    <h1>Gastrodia nantoensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia nantoensis, commonly known as the Nanto ginseng, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrition rather than photosynthesis. The plant produces a fleshy, tuberous root that is highly valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
