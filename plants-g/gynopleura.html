                    <h1>Gynopleura</h1>
<p>Gynopleura, commonly known as the female flower or gynoecium, is a specialized structure in certain plants, particularly in the flowering plants (angiosperms).</p>
<p>It is part of the female reproductive system and typically consists of the stigma, style, and ovary. The gynopleura is responsible for receiving pollen grains during pollination and facilitating fertilization. In some species, it may be modified into a structure that supports the development of the fruit.</p>
<p>Its morphology and function can vary widely depending on the plant family and ecological adaptations.</p>
