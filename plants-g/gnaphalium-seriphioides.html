                    <h1>Gnaphalium seriphioides</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium seriphioides, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, including South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The small, yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the cooler months, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
