<p>Glossorhyncha daymanensis, commonly known as the Dayman's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and its ability to thrive in specific, often isolated habitats. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
