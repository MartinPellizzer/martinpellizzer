                    <h1>Galearia lindlaeana</h1>
<p>Galearia lindlaeana, commonly known as the Lindley's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a delicate, scrambling growth habit with long, slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Galearia lindlaeana is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
