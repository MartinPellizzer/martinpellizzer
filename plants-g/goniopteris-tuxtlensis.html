<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a sturdy trunk that is covered in a mass of roots, which helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae that give it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and habitat provision.</p>
