                    <h1>Grammitis beddomeana</h1>
<p>Grammitis beddomeana, commonly known as the Beddome's maidenhair, is a rare fern species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grammitis beddomeana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
