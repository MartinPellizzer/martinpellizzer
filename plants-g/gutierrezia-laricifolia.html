                    <h1>Gutierrezia laricifolia</h1>
<p>Gutierrezia laricifolia, commonly known as silverleaf erigeron, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open woodlands and rocky soils. Its silver-gray foliage is a result of dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Gutierrezia laricifolia is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its potential use in landscaping due to its ornamental qualities.</p>
