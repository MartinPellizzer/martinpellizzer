                    <h1>Gymnocalycium leptanthum</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium leptanthum, commonly known as the slender-leafed barrel cactus, is a species native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, edible fruits. Gymnocalycium leptanthum is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick stems.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it a long-lived cactus, often reaching several decades in age.</p>
