                    <h1>Glandularia bipinnatifida var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Glandularia bipinnatifida var. ciliata, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. Its leaves are typically narrow and alternate, with finely serrated margins.</p>
<p>The glandular structures on its surfaces help to reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
