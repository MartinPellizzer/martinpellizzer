                    <h1>Goniophlebium furfuraceum</h1>
<p>Goniophlebium furfuraceum, commonly known as the woolly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
