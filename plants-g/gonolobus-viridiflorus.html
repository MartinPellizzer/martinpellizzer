<p>Gonolobus viridiflorus, commonly known as greenflower dodder, is a flowering plant in the family Convolvulaceae.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
