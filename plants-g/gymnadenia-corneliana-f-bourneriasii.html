                    <h1>Gymnadenia corneliana f. bourneriasii</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia corneliana f. bourneriasii, commonly known as the Bourneriasii form of the grass pinks, is a rare and striking variant of the species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which are typically more showy than those of the typical form. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in moist meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, while its stems are erect and bear the floral display.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique floral characteristics and limited distribution.</p>
