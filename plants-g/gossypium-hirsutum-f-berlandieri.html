                    <h1>Gossypium hirsutum f. berlandieri</h1>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum f. berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican cotton plant, is a botanical variant of upland cotton.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and fibrous boll structure, which are adaptations for arid environments. This form is native to Mexico and has been historically significant in the domestication of cotton. Its genetic traits have contributed to the development of modern cotton varieties.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important subject in studies of cotton evolution and plant adaptation.</p>
