<p>Gymnopteris bernoullii, commonly known as the Bernoulli's barren fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. Gymnopteris bernoullii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
