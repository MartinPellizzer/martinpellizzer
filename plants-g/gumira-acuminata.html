<p>Gumira acuminata, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a medium to large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>

The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by hard, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Gumira acuminata is valued for its strong, durable wood and is often used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
