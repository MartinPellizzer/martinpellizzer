                    <h1>Goniopteris prolifera</h1>
<p>Goniopteris prolifera, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the production of small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are pinnate, with a distinctive bifurcating structure that gives the plant its unique appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>This fern is also notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through rhizome fragmentation, which contributes to its widespread distribution in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
