                    <h1>Grumilea micralabastra</h1>
<p>Grumilea micralabastra, commonly known as the small-labellum grumilea, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature and intricate floral structure, featuring a slender stem and a highly specialized, often fragrant blossom. The plant's leaves are typically ovate and covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, which help in moisture retention. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are notable for their vibrant colors and unique labellum shape, which plays a crucial role in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Grumilea micralabastra is considered a conservation concern.</p>
