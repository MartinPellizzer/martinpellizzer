                    <h1>Gymnobalanus catesbyanus</h1>
<p>Gymnobalanus catesbyanus, commonly known as the American mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove swamps.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
