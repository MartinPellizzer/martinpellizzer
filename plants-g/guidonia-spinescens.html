<p>Guidonia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny guidonia, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
