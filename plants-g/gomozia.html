<p>Gomozia, commonly known as the "devil's fig," is a unique plant belonging to the genus Gomphostigma within the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered, fleshy fruits that resemble figs, which are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp woodlands. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Gomozia is notable for its ecological role in supporting various insect and bird species that feed on its fruits.</p>
