<p>Galinsoga filiformis, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits called achene. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
