                    <h1>Gentiana canchalagua</h1>
<p>Gentiana canchalagua, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
