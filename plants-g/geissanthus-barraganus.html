<p>Geissanthus barraganus, commonly known as the Barraganâ€™s bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or humid forest areas. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Geissanthus barraganus is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
