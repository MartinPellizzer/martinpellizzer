<p>Grastidium extra-axillare, commonly known as the axillary ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic species belonging to the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with its main stem emerging from the axil of the leaves, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are rarely seen due to their hidden position. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, contributing to its ghostly appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and poorly understood botanical specimen.</p>
