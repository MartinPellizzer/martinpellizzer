                    <h1>Gongora charontis</h1>
<p>Gongora charontis, commonly known as the Charontis Gongora, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns that resemble the wings of a butterfly. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests where it thrives on the forest floor. Its leaves are broad and dark green, adapted to capture as much light as possible in its dim habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gongora charontis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
