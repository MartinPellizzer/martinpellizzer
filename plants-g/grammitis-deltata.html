<p>Grammitis deltata, commonly known as the deltoid fernlet, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, compact clusters with a distinctive, deltoid-shaped frond. The fronds are usually light green, with a leathery texture and a finely divided, feather-like appearance. It prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the undersides of its fronds.</p>
