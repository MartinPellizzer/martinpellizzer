<p>Red-hot poker, scientifically known as Geissorhiza inflexa var. erosa, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It is celebrated for its vivid red-orange flowers that resemble poker chips, hence its common name. This hardy species thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ability to bloom from late winter to early spring adds a splash of color during the colder months. With its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a favorite among gardeners seeking both beauty and resilience.</p>
