                    <h1>Gymnopogon rupestris</h1>
<p>Gymnopogon rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
