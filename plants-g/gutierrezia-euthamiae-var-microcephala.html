                    <h1>Gutierrezia euthamiae var. microcephala</h1>
<p>Gutierrezia euthamiae var. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed greasewood, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, cylindrical seed pods that release seeds when disturbed. It has adapted to poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a common species in desert and semi-desert regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of ecological study.</p>
