                    <h1>Glyceria fluitans var. stricta</h1>
<p>Glyceria fluitans var. stricta, commonly known as the rigid floating grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or damp soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life makes it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
