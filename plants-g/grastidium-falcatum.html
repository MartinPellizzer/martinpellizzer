                    <h1>Grastidium falcatum</h1>
<p>Grastidium falcatum, commonly known as the slender arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically arrow-shaped, which help it float and capture sunlight efficiently. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Grastidium falcatum is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a decorative plant in artificial ponds.</p>
