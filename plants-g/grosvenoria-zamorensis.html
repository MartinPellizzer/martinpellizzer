<p>Grosvenoria zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamorensis orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy blooms that range in color from pale pink to deep violet. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
