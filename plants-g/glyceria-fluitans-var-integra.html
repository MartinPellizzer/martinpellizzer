<p>Glyceria fluitans var. integra, commonly known as the smooth floating grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Glyceria fluitans var. integra plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
