<p>Gentianella nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest understories. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is part of the Gentianaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
