                    <h1>Galanthus elwesii var. maximus</h1>
<p>Galanthus elwesii var. maximus, commonly known as the Elwesii Maximus snowdrop, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, particularly in Georgia and Turkey. This variety is distinguished by its large, white flowers with prominent yellow markings, which are more pronounced than those of typical snowdrops. The plant produces a single, upright stem bearing several blooms, and its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
