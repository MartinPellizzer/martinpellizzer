                    <h1>Gothofreda pannosa</h1>
<p>Gothofreda pannosa, commonly known as the pale lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the fungal partner. Its pale green to yellowish coloration is due to the presence of the algal component.</p>
<p>Gothofreda pannosa plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat.</p>
