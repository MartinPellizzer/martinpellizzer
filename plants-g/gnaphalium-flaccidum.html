<p>Gnaphalium flaccidum, commonly known as the slender everlasting or flaccid cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish to white flowers that are often surrounded by pale green or white bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium flaccidum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
