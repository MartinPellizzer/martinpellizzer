                    <h1>Gymnosporia buxifolia</h1>
<p>Gymnosporia buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf spurge, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties.</p>
