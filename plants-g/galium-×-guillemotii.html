                    <h1>Galium × guillemotii</h1>
<p>Galium × guillemotii, commonly known as the hybrid wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium × guillemotii is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its hybrid origin results from crosses between different species of Galium, contributing to its adaptability and variability in appearance.</p>
