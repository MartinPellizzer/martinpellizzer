<p>Gymnogramma myriophylla f. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible maiden hair fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are arching and often have a wavy or undulating appearance, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
