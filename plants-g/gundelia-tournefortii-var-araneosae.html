                    <h1>Gundelia tournefortii var. araneosae</h1>
<p>Gundelia tournefortii var. araneosae, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
