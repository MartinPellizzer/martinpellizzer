                    <h1>Gastrodia leoui</h1>
<p>Gastrodia leoui, commonly known as the Chinese club moss, is a rare and endangered orchid-like plant native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, creeping rhizome and a single, fleshy, club-shaped stem that bears a single, showy flower. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that help reduce water loss. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Gastrodia leoui is highly sought after in traditional medicine, further threatening its survival.</p>
