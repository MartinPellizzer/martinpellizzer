                    <h1>Gymnema nitens</h1>
<p>Gymnema nitens, commonly known as the Indian nettle or gymnema, is a climbing shrub native to the forests of India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its unique ability to inhibit the taste of sweetness, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. Gymnema nitens is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.</p>
<p>Its roots and leaves are often used to manage diabetes due to their hypoglycemic effects.</p>
