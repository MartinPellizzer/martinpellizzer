                    <h1>Grammitis erecta</h1>
<p>Grammitis erecta, commonly known as the upright fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that often grow on trees or rocks. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Grammitis erecta typically produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Its ornamental appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes.</p>
