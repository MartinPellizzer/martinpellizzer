                <h1>Grastidium exasperatum</h1>
<p>Grastidium exasperatum, commonly known as the fiery spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, often toxic sap.</p>
<p>This herbaceous plant typically features alternate, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both livestock and humans.</p>
