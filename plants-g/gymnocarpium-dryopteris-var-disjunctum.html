                    <h1>Gymnocarpium dryopteris var. disjunctum</h1>
<p>Gymnocarpium dryopteris var. disjunctum, commonly known as the disjunct maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its unique leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to specific regions of North America, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are bipinnate, with delicate, arching leaves that resemble those of its parent species. Its reproductive structures are apogamous, meaning it reproduces without the need for fertilization.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of this variant lies in its distinct ecological niche and morphological variation within the genus Gymnocarpium.</p>
