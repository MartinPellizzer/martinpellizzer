                    <h1>Gilliesia dimera</h1>
<p>Gilliesia dimera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with long, narrow leaves and a single, slender flower that typically blooms in late summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
