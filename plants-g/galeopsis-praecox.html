<p>Galeopsis praecox, commonly known as early hedge nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and reaches heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with blue or purple petals. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Galeopsis praecox is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
