<p>Gethyum, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed areas such as riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
