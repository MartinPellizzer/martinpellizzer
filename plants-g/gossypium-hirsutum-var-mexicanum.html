                    <h1>Gossypium hirsutum var. mexicanum</h1>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum var. mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican cotton, is a variant of upland cotton native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous boll structure and hairy leaves, typical of the Gossypium genus. The plant thrives in warm, arid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its fibers are used in textile production, similar to other cotton varieties.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated today due to its lower yield compared to modern commercial cotton strains.</p>
