<p>Geonoma stricta subsp.</p>
<p>submontana, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, upright fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
