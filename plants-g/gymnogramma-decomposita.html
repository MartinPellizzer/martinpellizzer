                    <h1>Gymnogramma decomposita</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma decomposita is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
