<p>Grammitis depressa, commonly known as the low fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled when young and unfurl as they mature. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
