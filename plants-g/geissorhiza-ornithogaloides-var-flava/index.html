<p>Ornithogaloides yellow, scientifically known as Geissorhiza ornithogaloides var. flava, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after species among plant enthusiasts and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
