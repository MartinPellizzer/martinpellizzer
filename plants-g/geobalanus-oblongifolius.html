<p>Geobalanus oblongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea almond, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water.</p>
