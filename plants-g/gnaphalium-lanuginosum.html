                    <h1>Gnaphalium lanuginosum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, woolly gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its scientific name reflects its hairy appearance, with "lanuginosum" referring to the lanugo-like downy coating on its stems and leaves.</p>
