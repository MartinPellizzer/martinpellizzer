The plant produces red berries that are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, similar to that of the common wintergreen. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Gaultheria megabracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
