                    <h1>Gymnosperma eriocarpa</h1>
<p>Gymnosperma eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly gymnosperma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hairy or woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which provides protection against environmental stressors. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a cone-like structure, a feature typical of gymnosperms, though it is actually an angiosperm.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
