                    <h1>Grammitis oreophila</h1>
<p>Grammitis oreophila, commonly known as the mountain hound's-tongue, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Grammitis oreophila is often found in cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions.</p>
