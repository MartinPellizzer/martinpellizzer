<p>Griffithia magnoliipetala, commonly known as the Griffith's magnolia, is a rare and ancient flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, white petals that resemble those of magnolia species, though it belongs to the family Magnoliaceae. The plant has a unique, elongated ovary and produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
