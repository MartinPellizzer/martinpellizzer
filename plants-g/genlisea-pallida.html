                    <h1>Genlisea pallida</h1>
<p>Genlisea pallida, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its unique trapping mechanism, which consists of bladder-like structures used to capture small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its specialized bladders for nutrient absorption. It thrives in nutrient-poor wetlands and requires consistent moisture to survive.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and intriguing biological adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
