<p>Grastidium nimium, commonly known as the Moonlight Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-blue petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with waxy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
