                    <h1>Glycine micans</h1>
<p>Glycine micans, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing edible seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various cuisines. Glycine micans is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in agricultural systems.</p>
<p>However, it can be toxic if consumed in large quantities, particularly due to the presence of certain alkaloids.</p>
