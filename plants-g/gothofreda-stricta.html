                    <h1>Gothofreda stricta</h1>
<p>Gothofreda stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ghostplant, is a unique member of the family Triuridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in small, inconspicuous inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gothofreda stricta is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
