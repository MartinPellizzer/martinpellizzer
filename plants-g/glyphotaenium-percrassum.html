                    <h1>Glyphotaenium percrassum</h1>
<p>Glyphotaenium percrassum, commonly known as the thick-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its robust, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to humid, temperate climates.</p>
