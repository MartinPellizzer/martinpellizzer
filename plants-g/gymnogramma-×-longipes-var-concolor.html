                    <h1>Gymnogramma × longipes var. concolor</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma × longipes var. concolor, commonly known as the smooth gymnogramma, is a hybrid fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'concolor' refers to its uniform coloration across the fronds.</p>
