<p>Gymnocalycium parvulum var. amoenum, commonly known as the "small-flowered pincushion cactus," is a succulent plant native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xeriscaping.</p>
