<p>Graphardisia skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's ghostflower, is a rare and endangered species native to the cloud forests of western Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with delicate, translucent leaves and small, pale blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other epiphytic species. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
