<p>Goodyera condensata, commonly known as the clustered twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces capsule fruits that contain minute seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and forest understories.</p>
