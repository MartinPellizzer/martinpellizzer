                    <h1>Grantia globosa</h1>
<p>Grantia globosa, commonly known as the globe sponge or globular sponge, is a unique marine organism that belongs to the phylum Porifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense, porous structure that allows it to filter water for nutrients. The sponge's body is composed of a matrix of collagen fibers and a network of channels called spongiocytes. It lacks true tissues and organs, relying instead on specialized cells for various functions.</p>
<p>Grantia globosa is typically found in shallow coastal waters and is an important part of marine ecosystems.</p>
