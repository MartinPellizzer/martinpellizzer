                    <h1>Grammitis trogophylla</h1>
<p>Grammitis trogophylla, commonly known as the Trogophylla fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are found on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Grammitis trogophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
