<p>Gastridium laxum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>Gastridium laxum is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
