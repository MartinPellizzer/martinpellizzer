<p>Gymnolomia hypochlora, commonly known as the pale ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and slender, aerial roots that allow it to grow on tree branches without soil. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it derives its nutrients from the air, rain, and debris accumulating around its roots. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Gymnolomia hypochlora is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
