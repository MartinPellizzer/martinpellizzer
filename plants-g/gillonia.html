                    <h1>Gillonia</h1>
<p>Gillonia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Gillonia produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain toxic seeds, which deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range.</p>
