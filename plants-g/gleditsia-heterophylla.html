                    <h1>Gleditsia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Gleditsia heterophylla, commonly known as the Chinese honeylocust, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that change shape along the stem, with upper leaves being trifoliate and lower ones being pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and tolerance to urban conditions.</p>
<p>The tree has a shallow root system, making it suitable for small spaces but potentially problematic in certain landscapes.</p>
