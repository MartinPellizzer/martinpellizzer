<p>Genoplesium woollsii, commonly known as the Woollâ€™s spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and its distinctive, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, narrow flowers. The plant produces a single, narrow spike bearing several pale green or white flowers with a faintly colored lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
