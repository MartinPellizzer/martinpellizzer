<p>Gaultheria humifusa, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, providing dense ground cover. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Gaultheria humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
