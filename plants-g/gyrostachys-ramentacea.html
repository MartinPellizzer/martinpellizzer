<p>Gyrostachys ramentacea, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Gyrostachys ramentacea is adapted to poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
