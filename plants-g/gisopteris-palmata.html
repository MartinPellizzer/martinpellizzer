<p>Gisopteris palmata, commonly known as the palmate fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with fronds that are palmately divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows from a short rhizome and produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, providing a dense, ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>Gisopteris palmata is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens or as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements.</p>
