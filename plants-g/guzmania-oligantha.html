                    <h1>Guzmania oligantha</h1>
<p>Guzmania oligantha, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence, which resembles a pink flamingo's head, hence its common name. Its rosette of broad, waxy leaves collects water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
<p>Guzmania oligantha is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
