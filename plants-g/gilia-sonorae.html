                    <h1>Gilia sonorae</h1>
<p>Gilia sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran gilia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Gilia sonorae plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native ecosystem.</p>
