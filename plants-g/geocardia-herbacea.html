                    <h1>Geocardia herbacea</h1>
<p>Geocardia herbacea, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that store water and nutrients, adapting to nutrient-poor soils. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale in color.</p>
<p>Geocardia herbacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms.</p>
