                    <h1>Genlisea flexuosa</h1>
<p>Genlisea flexuosa, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its unique trapping structures called bladder-like organs. These bladders are used to capture small aquatic invertebrates, which the plant then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils and has small, delicate leaves.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptation and nutrient acquisition strategies.</p>
