<p>Grastidium sarcophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the decaying organic matter in the pine rocklands where it grows.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and ecological requirements, Grastidium sarcophyllum is considered an endangered species.</p>
