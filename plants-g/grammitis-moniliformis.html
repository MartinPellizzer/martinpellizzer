                    <h1>Grammitis moniliformis</h1>
<p>Grammitis moniliformis, commonly known as the beaded fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a rosette-like pattern, with each leaflet appearing as a small, bead-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
