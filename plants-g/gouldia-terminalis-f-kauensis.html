                    <h1>Gouldia terminalis f. kauensis</h1>
<p>Gouldia terminalis f. kauensis, commonly known as the Kaua ªi gouldia, is a rare and unique variant of the gouldia species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in coastal areas, where it adapts to the high salt content and strong winds typical of the region. The foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range.</p>
