                    <h1>Gymnolomia microcephala var. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Gymnolomia microcephala var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like arrangement of stiff, needle-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
