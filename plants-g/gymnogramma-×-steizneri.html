                    <h1>Gymnogramma × steizneri</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma × steizneri, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Gymnogramma cuneata and Gymnogramma japonica.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, sword-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are often arranged in a compact, upright manner. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma × steizneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in indoor or shaded garden settings.</p>
