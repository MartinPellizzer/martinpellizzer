                    <h1>Geonoma spruceana var. compta</h1>
<p>Geonoma spruceana var. compta, commonly known as the slender geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'compta' is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical variety.</p>
