                    <h1>Gomphocarpus palmeri</h1>
<p>Gomphocarpus palmeri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gomphocarpus palmeri is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
