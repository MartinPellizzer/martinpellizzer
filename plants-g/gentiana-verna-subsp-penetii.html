<p>Gentiana verna subsp.</p>
<p>penetii, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention.</p>
