<p>Gentiana clarenii, commonly known as the Clarenii gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Gentiana clarenii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural growing conditions.</p>
