                    <h1>Glottiphyllum latum</h1>
<p>Glottiphyllum latum, commonly known as the broadleaf glottiphyllum, is a unique member of the Mesembryanthemaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is considered rare and is often found in specific, well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>
