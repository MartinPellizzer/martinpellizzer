<p>Geocarpon uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower earthstar, is a unique fungal plant that exhibits a fascinating life cycle.</p>
<p>It is a mycorrhizal fungus that forms symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain plants, particularly in sandy soils. The fruiting body of Geocarpon uniflorum resembles a star-shaped structure when it emerges from the ground, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its sporocarp consists of a central stem with radiating arms, each bearing a spore-producing structure.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
