<p>Gutierrezia digyna, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and sandy soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Gutierrezia digyna is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
