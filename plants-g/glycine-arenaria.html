                    <h1>Glycine arenaria</h1>
<p>Glycine arenaria, commonly known as sand clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, heathlands, and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Glycine arenaria is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
