                    <h1>Galium commune var. implexum</h1>
<p>Galium commune var. implexum, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in disturbed soils and a valuable plant for ecological studies.</p>
