<p>Grammitis clavata, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a dense, clustered growth pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, round structures called sorangia, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis clavata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
