                    <h1>Galarhoeus formosanus</h1>
<p>Galarhoeus formosanus, commonly known as the Taiwan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it has a complex symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
