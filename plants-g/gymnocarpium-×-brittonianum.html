                    <h1>Gymnocarpium × brittonianum</h1>
<p>Gymnocarpium × brittonianum, commonly known as the hybrid barren bladder, is a flowering plant in the family Cystopteraceae.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Gymnocarpium dryopteris and Gymnocarpium cymosum. The plant is characterized by its fern-like fronds and spore-bearing structures called soruses. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often found in regions where the parent species overlap geographically.</p>
