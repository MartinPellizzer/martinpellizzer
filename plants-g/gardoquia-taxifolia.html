                    <h1>Gardoquia taxifolia</h1>
<p>Gardoquia taxifolia, commonly known as the slender yew, is a rare and ancient coniferous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gardoquia taxifolia is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
