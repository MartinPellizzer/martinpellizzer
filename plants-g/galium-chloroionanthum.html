                    <h1>Galium chloroionanthum</h1>
<p>Galium chloroionanthum, commonly known as the coastal bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic to ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Galium chloroionanthum is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub and dune environments.</p>
