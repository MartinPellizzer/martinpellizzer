                            <h1>Galium Vulgare</h1>
<p>Galium vulgare, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a widespread herbaceous plant found in various habitats across Europe, Asia, and North America. It thrives in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands, stream banks, and meadows, often forming dense mats along the ground. The plant features slender stems covered in tiny hairs and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite and usually have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Despite its humble look, Galium vulgare plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
