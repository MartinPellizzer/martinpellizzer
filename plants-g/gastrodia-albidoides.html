                    <h1>Gastrodia albidoides</h1>
<p>Gastrodia albidoides, commonly known as the white-flowered gastrodia, is a rare and ancient orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal symbiosis for its nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, club-like structure that contains the developing flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fleshy appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and slow growth, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
