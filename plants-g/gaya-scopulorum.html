                    <h1>Gaya scopulorum</h1>
<p>Gaya scopulorum, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically hidden within its foliage. Gaya scopulorum is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
