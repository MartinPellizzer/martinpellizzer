                    <h1>Genista purgans</h1>
<p>Genista purgans, commonly known as yellow broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its shrub-like growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a common ornamental and ecological plant.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
