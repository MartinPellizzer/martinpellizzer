                    <h1>Gesneria scabra var. scabra</h1>
<p>Gesneria scabra var. scabra, commonly known as the rough-stemmed gesneria, is a species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rugged, ridged stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This evergreen shrub is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
