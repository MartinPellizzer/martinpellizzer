                            <h1>Gnaphalium Germanicum Var. Pyramidatum</h1>
<p>Common fleabane, scientifically known as Gnaphalium germanicum var. pyramidatum, is a hardy perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is recognized for its dense, fluffy clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. Its common name is derived from its historical use as a deterrent for fleas and other pests. Despite its small stature, Common fleabane plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat.</p>
