<p>Common bedstraw, scientifically known as Galium tinctorium var. subbiflorum, is a lesser-known member of the Rubiaceae family that thrives in moist, shaded environments across Europe and parts of Asia. This small herbaceous plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. While it may not be as showy as other wildflowers, it plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization. Its historical use in dyeing textiles and traditional medicine adds to its cultural significance. Despite its modest appearance, Common bedstraw holds a unique place in both natural and human history.</p>
