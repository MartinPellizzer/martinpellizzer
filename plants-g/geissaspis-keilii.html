<p>Geissaspis keilii, commonly known as the Keil's geissaspis, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to specific regions in Central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often found in protected areas and requires careful study to understand its ecological role.</p>
