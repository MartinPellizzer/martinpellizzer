                    <h1>Glechoma glomerata</h1>
<p>Glechoma glomerata, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, purple or blue flowers in whorls along the stems. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Glechoma glomerata is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
