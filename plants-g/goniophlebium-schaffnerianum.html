                    <h1>Goniophlebium schaffnerianum</h1>
<p>Goniophlebium schaffnerianum, commonly known as the Schaffner's fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often described as being similar to those of a fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizome is fibrous and serves as a storage organ for nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
