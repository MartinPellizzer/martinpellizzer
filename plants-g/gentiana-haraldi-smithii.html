<p>Gentiana haraldi-smithii, commonly known as Smith's gentian, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and forest floors. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
