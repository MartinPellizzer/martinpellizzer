                    <h1>Glechoma lobulata</h1>
<p>Glechoma lobulata, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer. The plant spreads rapidly through rhizomes and stolons, forming dense mats that can colonize moist, shady areas. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Glechoma lobulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
