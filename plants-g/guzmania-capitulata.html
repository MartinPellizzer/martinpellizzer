                    <h1>Guzmania capitulata</h1>
<p>Guzmania capitulata, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble a pineapple, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects rainwater, creating a mini-ecosystem for small organisms. It produces a tall flower spike that blooms in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>Guzmania capitulata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
