<p>Grammitis holophlebia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a silvery underside due to the presence of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis holophlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitats.</p>
