<p>Gymnosporia filamentosa var. major, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Gymnosporia filamentosa var. major plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats.</p>
