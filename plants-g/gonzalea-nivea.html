<p>Gonzalea nivea, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, silvery foliage that resembles the appearance of snow, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Gonzalea nivea has a unique structure with finely divided leaves that form a dense, cushion-like growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
