<p>Gypsophila perfoliata subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosa, commonly known as silvery candytuft, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with silver-tomentose (fuzzy) leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which are often used in floral arrangements.</p>
