<p>Gagea foliosa subsp.</p>
<p>lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southwestern Europe, particularly Portugal and Spain. It typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, and it is often found in rocky or limestone-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
