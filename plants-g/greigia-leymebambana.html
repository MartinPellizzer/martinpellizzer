                    <h1>Greigia leymebambana</h1>
<p>Greigia leymebambana, commonly known as the leymebambana tree, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
<p>It is native to the Amazon rainforest and thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. The plant features compound leaves with alternating leaflets and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its ecological role includes supporting local biodiversity and contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>However, it remains relatively understudied, limiting its recognition in botanical literature.</p>
