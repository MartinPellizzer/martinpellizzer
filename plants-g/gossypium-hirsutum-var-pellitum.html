                    <h1>Gossypium hirsutum var. pellitum</h1>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum var. pellitum, commonly known as the short-staple cotton, is a variant of upland cotton native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter fiber length compared to the standard G. hirsutum, which influences its use in textile production. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with woody stems and produces fluffy bolls containing cotton fibers. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is cultivated for its economic value.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from other cotton varieties in terms of morphology and agricultural applications.</p>
