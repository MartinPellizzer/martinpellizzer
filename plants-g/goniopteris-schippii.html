<p>Goniopteris schippii, commonly known as the Schippi's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Goniopteris schippii plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
