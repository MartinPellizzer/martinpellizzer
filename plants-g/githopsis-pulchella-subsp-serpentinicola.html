<p>Githopsis pulchella subsp.</p>
<p>serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine githopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to grow in serpentine soils. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, heavy soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its unique adaptations allow it to tolerate the high levels of heavy metals present in serpentine substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
