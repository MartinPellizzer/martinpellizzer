                    <h1>Gnaphalium sessile</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium sessile, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or yellow. The plant has slender, branching stems and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium sessile is also known for producing a mild, aromatic scent, which can be detected when the leaves are crushed.</p>
