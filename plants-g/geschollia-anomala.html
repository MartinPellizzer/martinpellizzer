                    <h1>Geschollia anomala</h1>
<p>Geschollia anomala, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and its unique, small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
