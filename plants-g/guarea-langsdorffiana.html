                    <h1>Guarea langsdorffiana</h1>
<p>Guarea langsdorffiana, commonly known as the "Balsa tree" or "Cuban balsa," is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is exceptionally light and is historically valued for its use in model-making and aircraft construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
