                    <h1>Gagea tibetica</h1>
<p>Gagea tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan spring beauty, is a bulbous plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, adapting to the cold and short growing season of its alpine habitat. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winters and regenerate in the following season.</p>
<p>Gagea tibetica is often found in rocky soils and meadows, contributing to the biodiversity of its mountainous environment.</p>
