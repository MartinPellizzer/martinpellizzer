<p>Gymnocactus viereckii, commonly known as the Vierck's naked cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red or orange fruits. Its stems are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gymnocactus viereckii is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
