                    <h1>Genoplesium stephensonii</h1>
<p>Genoplesium stephensonii, commonly known as the Stephenson's hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate terrestrial orchid native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Genoplesium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys, where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its small, greenish-white flowers are usually arranged in a spike and bloom during the cooler months of the year.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its restricted distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
