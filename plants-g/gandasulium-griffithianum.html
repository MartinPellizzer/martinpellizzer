<p>Gandasulium griffithianum, commonly known as the Himalayan sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of northern India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in dense forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural range.</p>
