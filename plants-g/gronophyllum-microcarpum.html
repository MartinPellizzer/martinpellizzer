                    <h1>Gronophyllum microcarpum</h1>
<p>Gronophyllum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in reforestation projects in its native region.</p>
