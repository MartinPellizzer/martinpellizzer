                    <h1>Gerontogea biflora</h1>
<p>Gerontogea biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered old-age plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking bi-floral structure, where two distinct flowers develop on a single inflorescence. The plant possesses a compact, herbaceous growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple, with five petals and a prominent central stamen.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology, Gerontogea biflora is of great interest to botanists studying evolutionary adaptations in alpine flora.</p>
