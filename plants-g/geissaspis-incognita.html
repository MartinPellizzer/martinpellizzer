<p>Geissaspis incognita, commonly known as the unknown geissaspis, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and limited geographic distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
