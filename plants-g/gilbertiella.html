<p>Gilbertiella, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, often translucent fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. Gilbertiella species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They have a rhizomatous growth habit and produce small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with unique leaf shapes and growth patterns.</p>
