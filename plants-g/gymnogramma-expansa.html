<p>Gymnogramma expansa, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma expansa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
