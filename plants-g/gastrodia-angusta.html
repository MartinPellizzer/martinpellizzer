                    <h1>Gastrodia angusta</h1>
<p>Gastrodia angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf thunder god, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tuberous root system and its striking, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
