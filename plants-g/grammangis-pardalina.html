<p>Grammangis pardalina, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Grammangis pardalina is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
