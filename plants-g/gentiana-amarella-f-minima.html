                    <h1>Gentiana amarella f. minima</h1>
<p>Gentiana amarella f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in specialty gardens.</p>
