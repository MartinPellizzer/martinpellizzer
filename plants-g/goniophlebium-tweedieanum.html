<p>Goniophlebium tweedieanum, commonly known as the Tweedie's fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Goniophlebium tweedieanum is relatively rare and is often found in specific geographic regions, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
