                    <h1>Gymnocalycium pulquinense</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium pulquinense, commonly known as the Pachyphytum pulquinense, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium pulquinense is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appearance.</p>
