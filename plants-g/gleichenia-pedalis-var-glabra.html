                    <h1>Gleichenia pedalis var. glabra</h1>
<p>Gleichenia pedalis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth Gleichenia, is a fern species characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and structure. The leaves are covered in a fine, smooth texture, giving the plant its varietal name "glabra," meaning "smooth" in Latin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its simple, elegant appearance and its role in ecological succession in temperate regions.</p>
