                    <h1>Gifola lutescens</h1>
<p>Gifola lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and pond margins. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Gifola lutescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
