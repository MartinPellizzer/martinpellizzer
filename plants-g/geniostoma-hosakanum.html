                    <h1>Geniostoma hosakanum</h1>
<p>Geniostoma hosakanum, commonly known as the Hosaka's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, Geniostoma hosakanum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
