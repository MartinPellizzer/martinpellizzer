                <h1>Gymnaplatanthera jacksonii</h1>
<p>Gymnaplatanthera jacksonii, commonly known as Jackson's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
