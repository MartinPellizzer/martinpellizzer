<p>Gastridium phleoides, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically yellow-green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungus, which together carry out photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Gastridium phleoides is widely distributed across temperate regions and is known for its chemical compounds, which have been studied for potential medicinal uses.</p>
