                    <h1>Geocardia</h1>
<p>Geocardia, commonly known as the "rock liverwort," is a genus of small, non-vascular plants belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, rocky habitats, often growing on stone surfaces or in crevices. They possess a thalloid structure, which is a flat, ribbon-like body composed of a single layer of cells. Geocardia species are characterized by their ability to thrive in harsh environments, making them resilient to desiccation and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Their simple morphology and specialized adaptations make them important indicators of environmental conditions in their native habitats.</p>
