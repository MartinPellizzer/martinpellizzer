                    <h1>Galeola hydra</h1>
<p>Galeola hydra, commonly known as the water fern, is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Galeola hydra is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate varying water conditions.</p>
