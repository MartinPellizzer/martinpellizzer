<p>Gilliesia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf gilliesia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, large, waxy leaf that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Gilliesia monophylla thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
