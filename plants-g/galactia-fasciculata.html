                    <h1>Galactia fasciculata</h1>
<p>Galactia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds, and it often grows in dry, rocky habitats. Its common name reflects the milky sap it exudes when damaged, which is a typical feature of many legumes.</p>
<p>Galactia fasciculata is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
