                    <h1>Guettarda zygophlebia</h1>
<p>Guettarda zygophlebia, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows on the branches of other trees. The plant has small, opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants over time, making it a significant ecological factor in its habitat.</p>
