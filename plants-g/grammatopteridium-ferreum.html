                    <h1>Grammatopteridium ferreum</h1>
<p>Grammatopteridium ferreum, commonly known as the iron fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, metallic-green fronds that give it its common name. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Grammatopteridium ferreum is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological health.</p>
