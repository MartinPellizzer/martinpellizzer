<p>Glossorhyncha kerewensis, commonly known as the Kerewen's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower structure and striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the dense canopy of its habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
