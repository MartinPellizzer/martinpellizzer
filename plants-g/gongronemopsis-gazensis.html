<p>Gongronemopsis gazensis, commonly known as the Ganzan fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Grande-Terre in the French Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lyrate-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense tropical forests where it clings to tree trunks or grows on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
