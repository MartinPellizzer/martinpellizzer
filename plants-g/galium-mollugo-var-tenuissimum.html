<p>Galium mollugo var. tenuissimum, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a delicate, creeping growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common species in early successional habitats and a useful indicator of soil moisture conditions.</p>
