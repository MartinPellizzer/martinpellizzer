                    <h1>Gagea anonyma</h1>
<p>Gagea anonyma, commonly known as the pale gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, white or pale blue flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are small and often hidden beneath the soil surface, contributing to its elusive nature.</p>
<p>Gagea anonyma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
