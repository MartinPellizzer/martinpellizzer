                    <h1>Gesneria calycosa var. alpina</h1>
<p>Gesneria calycosa var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features striking, dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its cool, moist environment. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to container gardening.</p>
