                    <h1>Gymnadenia conopsea f. serotina</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia conopsea f. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering grass of the meadows, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the common green gentian.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its late blooming period, typically occurring in late summer, which sets it apart from the typical flowering time of its parent species. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in a loose spike. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions.</p>
