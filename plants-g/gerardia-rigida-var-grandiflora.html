<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its hardiness and ability to survive in extreme climatic conditions.</p>
