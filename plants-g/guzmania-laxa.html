<p>Guzmania laxa, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting bracts that often display shades of pink, red, and orange, resembling the plumage of a flamingo. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and insects. Its flowering stem produces multiple small, white, tubular flowers that bloom sequentially over time.</p>
<p>Guzmania laxa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish.</p>
