<p>Gilia ophthalmoides subsp.</p>
<p>flavocincta, commonly known as the yellow-banded gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its yellow-orange floral bands, which are more pronounced than in other related species. It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, often in areas with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, oval fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native environment.</p>
