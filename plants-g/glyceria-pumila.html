<p>Glyceria pumila, commonly known as the smooth glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense mats, forming a low-growing, rhizomatous vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers in late summer. Glyceria pumila is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats.</p>
