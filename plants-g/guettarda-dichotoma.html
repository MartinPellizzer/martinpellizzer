<p>Guettarda dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Guettarda dichotoma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
