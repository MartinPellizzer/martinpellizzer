<p>Glyceria fluitans var. notata, commonly known as the floating grass or water bamboo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often forming a carpet-like surface on the water's surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water and moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it valuable for ecological restoration projects.</p>
