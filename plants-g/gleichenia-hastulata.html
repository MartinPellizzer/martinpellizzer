<p>Gleichenia hastulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf common huperzia, is a fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its linear, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Gleichenia hastulata is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
