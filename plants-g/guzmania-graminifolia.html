                    <h1>Guzmania graminifolia</h1>
<p>Guzmania graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaf bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped inflorescence, which features a vibrant, long-lasting flower spike that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Guzmania graminifolia is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
