                    <h1>Gerocephalus</h1>
<p>Gerocephalus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in harsh environments. Gerocephalus species often grow from a bulb-like structure, which helps them survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>They play an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil.</p>
