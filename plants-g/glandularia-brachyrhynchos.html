                    <h1>Glandularia brachyrhynchos</h1>
<p>Glandularia brachyrhynchos, commonly known as the narrowleaf glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores and retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often hairy, and the leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Glandularia brachyrhynchos is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments.</p>
