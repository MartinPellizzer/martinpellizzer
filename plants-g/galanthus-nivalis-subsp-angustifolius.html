<p>Galanthus nivalis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowdrop, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more elongated compared to the broader leaves of the typical G. nivalis. It thrives in woodland and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring display.</p>
