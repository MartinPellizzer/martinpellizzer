                    <h1>Glossocardia</h1>
<p>Glossocardia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive tactile texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals and stamens that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. Glossocardia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, and they often thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
