                    <h1>Glomera dubia</h1>
<p>Glomera dubia, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Its roots are typically absent, and it relies on aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Glomera dubia is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
