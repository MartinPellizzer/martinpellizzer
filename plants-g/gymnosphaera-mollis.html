                    <h1>Gymnosphaera mollis</h1>
<p>Gymnosphaera mollis, commonly known as the soft-sphere cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their fleshy, segmented structure. Gymnosphaera mollis is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of ancient plant lineages and evolutionary botany.</p>
