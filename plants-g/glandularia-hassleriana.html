                    <h1>Glandularia hassleriana</h1>
<p>Glandularia hassleriana, commonly known as the hairy verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which give it a fuzzy appearance and help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
