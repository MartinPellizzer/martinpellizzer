                    <h1>Gymnosperma</h1>
<p>Gymnosperma, commonly known as the gymnosperm, is a group of seed-producing plants that do not produce flowers or fruits.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their naked seeds, which are typically found in cones rather than enclosed ovules. Gymnosperms include conifers, cycads, ginkgos, and gnetophytes, and they are among the oldest groups of plants on Earth. They are adapted to a wide range of environments, from arid regions to temperate forests.</p>
<p>Their vascular systems and ability to reproduce without water make them highly resilient and ecologically significant.</p>
