                    <h1>Glechoma rugosa</h1>
<p>Glechoma rugosa, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it effective for ground cover in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Glechoma rugosa is also known for its aromatic foliage, which emits a mild mint-like scent when crushed.</p>
