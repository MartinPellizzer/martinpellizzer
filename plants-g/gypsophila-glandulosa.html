                    <h1>Gypsophila glandulosa</h1>
<p>Gypsophila glandulosa, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, delicate white or pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils with minimal water. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper underground.</p>
<p>Gypsophila glandulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
