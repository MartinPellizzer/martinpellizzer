<p>Galium psilocladum, commonly known as the ghostflower or ghost plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise sparse appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Galium psilocladum is also known for its ability to survive in extreme temperatures and limited water conditions.</p>
