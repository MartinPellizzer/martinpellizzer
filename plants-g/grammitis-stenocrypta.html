<p>Grammitis stenocrypta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis stenocrypta plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
