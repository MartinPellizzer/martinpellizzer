                    <h1>Galium pendulum</h1>
<p>Galium pendulum, commonly known as weeping wood-sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, drooping stems that bear small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its cascading appearance and its ability to form dense, ground-covering mats.</p>
