                    <h1>Gagea lutea var. viridis</h1>
<p>Gagea lutea var. viridis, commonly known as the green-flowered gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale green. The plant produces small, white, nodding flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils, and it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Gagea lutea var. viridis is often found in open woods and meadows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
