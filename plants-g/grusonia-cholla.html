                    <h1>Grusonia cholla</h1>
<p>Grusonia cholla, commonly known as the cholla cactus, is a spineless, cylindrical cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, jointed stems that branch out in all directions, forming a sprawling shrub-like structure. The plant is covered in fine, hair-like spines and produces yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Grusonia cholla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
