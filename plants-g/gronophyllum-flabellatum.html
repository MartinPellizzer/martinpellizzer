                    <h1>Gronophyllum flabellatum</h1>
<p>Gronophyllum flabellatum, commonly known as the desert gum or flabellate gum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by insects such as bees and wasps. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, reducing water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Gronophyllum flabellatum is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
