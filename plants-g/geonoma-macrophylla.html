<p>Geonoma macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
