<p>Goniopteris francoana, commonly known as the Franco's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation makes it a striking and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
