                    <h1>Gaedawakka coriacea</h1>
<p>Gaedawakka coriacea, commonly known as the rough-hairy kangaroo paw, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, recurved, red or orange-colored bracts that resemble the claws of a kangaroo. The plant has thick, leathery leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and flies.</p>
<p>Gaedawakka coriacea is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
