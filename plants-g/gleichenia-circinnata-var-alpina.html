                    <h1>Gleichenia circinnata var. alpina</h1>
<p>Gleichenia circinnata var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Gleichenia, is a fern species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and alpine meadows. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky, high-altitude habitats.</p>
