                            <h1>Galium Sylvaticum Var. Rubens</h1>
<p>Galium sylvaticum var. rubens is a striking variant of the wood sorrel family known for its vibrant red stems and heart-shaped leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest understories across eastern North America. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for wildflower gardens and ecological restoration projects. The species is also valued for its ability to enrich soil and support local wildlife. Despite its beauty, it remains a lesser-known gem in the world of native flora.</p>
