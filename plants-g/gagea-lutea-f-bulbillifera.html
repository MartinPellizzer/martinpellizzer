                    <h1>Gagea lutea f. bulbillifera</h1>
<p>Gagea lutea f. bulbillifera, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem bulbiferous form, is a botanical variant of the species Gagea lutea.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States, particularly California. The plant produces small, yellow, star-shaped flowers in early spring, and its leaves are grass-like and narrow. One distinguishing feature of this form is the presence of bulbils, which are small, vegetative propagules that form along the stem.</p>
<p>These bulbils can detach and grow into new plants, making the species highly adaptable and easy to propagate.</p>
