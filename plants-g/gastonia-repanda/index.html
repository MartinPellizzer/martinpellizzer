                            <h1>Gastonia Repanda</h1>
<p>Gastonia repanda, scientifically known as Gastonia repanda, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Cycadaceae. Native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk that can grow up to several meters in height. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Gastonia repanda is now classified as critically endangered. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species for future generations.</p>
