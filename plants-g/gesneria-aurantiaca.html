<p>Gesneria aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces striking orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Gesneria aurantiaca is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
