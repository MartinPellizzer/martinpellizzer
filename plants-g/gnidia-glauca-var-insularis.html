                    <h1>Gnidia glauca var. insularis</h1>
<p>Gnidia glauca var. insularis, commonly known as the insular gnidia, is a flowering plant native to specific islands in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, typical of the Rhamnaceae family.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
