                    <h1>Glossorhyncha retusa</h1>
<p>Glossorhyncha retusa, commonly known as the slender-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries.</p>
<p>The plant's root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
