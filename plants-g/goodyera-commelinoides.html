                    <h1>Goodyera commelinoides</h1>
<p>Goodyera commelinoides, commonly known as the fairy slipper or ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, translucent leaves and unique, slipper-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in shaded, humid environments, relying on its roots for nutrients rather than soil. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale green, are adapted for pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often considered an indicator species of undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
