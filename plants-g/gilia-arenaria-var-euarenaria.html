<p>Gilia arenaria var. euarenaria, commonly known as the sand gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
