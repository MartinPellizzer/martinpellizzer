<p>Gossypium populifolium, commonly known as the cottonleaf tree, is a species of shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves with a serrated margin, and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like fibers in its fruit, which are similar to those of other cotton species but are not typically used for commercial cotton production.</p>
<p>It is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems.</p>
