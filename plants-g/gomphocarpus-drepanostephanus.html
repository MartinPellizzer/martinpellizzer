<p>Gomphocarpus drepanostephanus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive crown-like structure. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain the toxic, milky sap, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gomphocarpus drepanostephanus is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
