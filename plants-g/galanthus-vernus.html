<p>Galanthus vernus, commonly known as the common snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, nodding white flowers that bloom early in the spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem, which consists of two outer petals and three inner petals. It thrives in woodland soils and partial shade, preferring moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Galanthus vernus is a symbol of hope and renewal, often associated with the arrival of spring.</p>
