<p>Geonoma telesiana, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
