<p>Glia, commonly known as glial cells, are not plants but a type of cell found in the nervous system.</p>
<p>They provide structural support, insulation, and nourishment to neurons. While not botanical in nature, they play a crucial role in the function of the brain and spinal cord. Glial cells are categorized into several types, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia.</p>
<p>Their importance in neural communication and maintenance is well-documented in neuroscience.</p>
