<p>Gnaphalium repens, commonly known as the creeping everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium repens is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
