<p>Geonoma luetzelburgii, commonly known as the Luetzelburg's fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
