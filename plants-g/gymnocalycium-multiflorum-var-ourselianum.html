                    <h1>Gymnocalycium multiflorum var. ourselianum</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium multiflorum var. ourselianum, commonly known as the Ourselianus Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a thick, ribbed stem covered in white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
