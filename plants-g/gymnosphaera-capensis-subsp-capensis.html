<p>Gymnosphaera capensis subsp.</p>
<p>capensis, commonly known as the Cape cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the upper part. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
