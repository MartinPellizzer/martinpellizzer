                    <h1>Geranium viscosissimum</h1>
<p>Geranium viscosissimum, commonly known as sticky geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves that exude a sticky substance when touched, a feature that aids in deterring herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
