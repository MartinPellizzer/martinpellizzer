<p>Galium palustre var. maximum, commonly known as marsh stitchwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, ascending stems that often branch near the base, covered with small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically pubescent, with a slightly waxy texture, and the plant has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
