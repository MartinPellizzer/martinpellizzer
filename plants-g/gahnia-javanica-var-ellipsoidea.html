                    <h1>Gahnia javanica var. ellipsoidea</h1>
<p>Gahnia javanica var. ellipsoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form extensive clumps, making it a common component of wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is often distinguished from other Gahnia species by its elliptical leaf shape and reduced floral structures.</p>
