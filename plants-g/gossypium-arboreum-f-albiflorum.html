                    <h1>Gossypium arboreum f. albiflorum</h1>
<p>Gossypium arboreum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered tree cotton, is a botanical variant of the tree cotton plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and the presence of white flowers, which distinguish it from other forms of Gossypium. The plant produces fibrous seeds encased in a fluffy, white covering, similar to other cotton species. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs aimed at improving cotton traits.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists and agricultural scientists due to its unique floral and morphological features.</p>
