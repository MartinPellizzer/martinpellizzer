                    <h1>Gomphia guatemalensis</h1>
<p>Gomphia guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan gomphia, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gomphaceae and is characterized by its unique, spore-producing structures called sporophytes. The plant is notable for its delicate, leaf-like structures that are often covered in fine, hair-like appendages. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gomphia guatemalensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
