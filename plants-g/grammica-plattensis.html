                    <h1>Grammica plattensis</h1>
<p>Grammica plattensis, commonly known as the Plattens Island Grammica, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Plattens Island.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to lavender. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Grammica plattensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for local pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
