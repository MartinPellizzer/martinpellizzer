<p>Gothofreda patula, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree bark or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is subject to conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in the field of orchidology.</p>
