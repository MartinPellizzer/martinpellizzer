                    <h1>Goniophlebium collinsii</h1>
<p>Goniophlebium collinsii, commonly known as Collins' fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that often display a striking coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
