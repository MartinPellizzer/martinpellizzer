<p>Gastrochilus coriaceus, commonly known as the thick-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its tropical habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
