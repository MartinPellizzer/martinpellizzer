                    <h1>Gagnepainia harmandii</h1>
<p>Gagnepainia harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a trait typical of cycads, and is dioecious, meaning male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gagnepainia harmandii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities.</p>
