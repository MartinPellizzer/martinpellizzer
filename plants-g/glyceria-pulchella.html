                    <h1>Glyceria pulchella</h1>
<p>Glyceria pulchella, commonly known as the slender glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that contribute to wetland vegetation structure. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Glyceria pulchella is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland restoration projects.</p>
