                    <h1>Galactia decumbens</h1>
<p>Galactia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Galactia decumbens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules also contributes to its ecological significance in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
