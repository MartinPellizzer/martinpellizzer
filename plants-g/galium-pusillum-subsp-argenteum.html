<p>Galium pusillum subsp.</p>
<p>argenteum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine, silky hairs that give it a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
