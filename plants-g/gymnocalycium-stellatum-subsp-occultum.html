<p>Gymnocalycium stellatum subsp.</p>
<p>occultum, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to a small region in northern Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a low-growing species that forms a compact rosette, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
