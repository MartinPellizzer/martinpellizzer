<p>Grastidium sororium, commonly known as the twin-leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, twin leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink and white, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Grastidium sororium is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
