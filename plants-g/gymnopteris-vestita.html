<p>Gymnopteris vestita, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, linear fronds that are typically unbranched and lack true leaves. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Gymnopteris vestita thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
