                    <h1>Giardia</h1>
<p>Giardia, commonly known as giardia lamblia, is not a plant but a parasitic protozoan.</p>
<p>It is a single-celled organism that causes giardiasis, a diarrheal illness in humans and animals. While it is not botanically classified as a plant, it is often mistakenly referred to in discussions about waterborne diseases. Giardia lacks the complex structures found in plants, such as roots, stems, and leaves.</p>
<p>Instead, it thrives in aquatic environments and spreads through contaminated water sources.</p>
