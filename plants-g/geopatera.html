<p>Geopatera, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often showy flowers that are adapted to thrive in rocky or arid environments. Geopatera species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, delicate blooms in shades of white, yellow, or green. They are native to various regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, where they grow in crevices and on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to their specialized habitat requirements, many Geopatera species are rare and face threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
