<p>Geranium macrorrhizum, commonly known as the large-root geranium, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient ground cover.</p>
<p>Geranium macrorrhizum is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas, thriving in partial to full shade.</p>
