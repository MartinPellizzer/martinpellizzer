                    <h1>Gonostemon macowanii var. abrasus</h1>
<p>Gonostemon macowanii var. abrasus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed gonostemon, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in rough, sometimes hairy texture, and its small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
