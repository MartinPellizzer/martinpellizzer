<p>Globularia minima, commonly known as the dwarf globularia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as bloom. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, decorative plants.</p>
