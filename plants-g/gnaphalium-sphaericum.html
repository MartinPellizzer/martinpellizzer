<p>Gnaphalium sphaericum, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small globes. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically silver-gray and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
