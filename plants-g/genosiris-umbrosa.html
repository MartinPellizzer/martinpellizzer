                    <h1>Genosiris umbrosa</h1>
<p>Genosiris umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow iris, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces delicate, violet-blue flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>Genosiris umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
