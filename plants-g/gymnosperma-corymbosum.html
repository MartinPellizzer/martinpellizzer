                    <h1>Gymnosperma corymbosum</h1>
<p>Gymnosperma corymbosum, commonly known as the American chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fagaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, spiky fruits called nuts, which are encased in a prickly husk. Gymnosperma corymbosum was once a dominant species in forests but has been nearly wiped out by the chestnut blight, a fungal disease.</p>
<p>Its ecological and historical significance remains a focus of conservation efforts.</p>
