                    <h1>Gnemon neglecta</h1>
<p>Gnemon neglecta, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its leaves are evergreen and typically oval in shape, with a waxy surface.</p>
<p>Gnemon neglecta is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife.</p>
