<p>Gutenbergia nivea, commonly known as the snowflake lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, powdery appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium, typical of lichens. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
