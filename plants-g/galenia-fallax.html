                    <h1>Galenia fallax</h1>
<p>Galenia fallax, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dark green, glossy leaves with a distinctive silver-gray underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.</p>
