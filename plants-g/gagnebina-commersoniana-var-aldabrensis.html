                    <h1>Gagnebina commersoniana var. aldabrensis</h1>
<p>Gagnebina commersoniana var. aldabrensis, commonly known as the Aldabra giant tortoise plant, is a unique succulent native to the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the dry season, which are followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. It is adapted to the harsh, coastal environment with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
