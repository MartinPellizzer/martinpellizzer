<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of tubular flowers surrounded by ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
