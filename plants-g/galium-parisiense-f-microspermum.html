<p>Galium parisiense f. microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are notably smaller than those of the typical variety, giving it its specific epithet "microspermum.".</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
