                    <h1>Giadotrum dongnaiense</h1>
<p>Giadotrum dongnaiense, commonly known as the Dong Nai mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense forests at higher elevations. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
