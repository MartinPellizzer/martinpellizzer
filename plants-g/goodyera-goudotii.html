                    <h1>Goodyera goudotii</h1>
<p>Goodyera goudotii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green or white leaves and its unique, orchid-like flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than from soil.</p>
<p>Goodyera goudotii is highly sought after for its ornamental value and is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
