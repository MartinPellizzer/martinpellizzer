<p>Goniophlebium meniscifolium var. adnatum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
