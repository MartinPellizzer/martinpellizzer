                            <h1>Gladiolus Dalenii Subsp. Andongensis</h1>
<p>Gladiolus dalenii subsp. andongensis is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. This subspecies is known for its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors including red, pink, and white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical treasure.</p>
