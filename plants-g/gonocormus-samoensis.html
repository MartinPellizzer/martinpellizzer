                    <h1>Gonocormus samoensis</h1>
<p>Gonocormus samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the islands of Samoa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, unbranched stem and produces few, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
