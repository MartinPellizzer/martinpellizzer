<p>Gnaphalium acaule, commonly known as the slender everlasting flower, is a herbaceous plant native to regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The small, fluffy flowers produce copious amounts of lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
