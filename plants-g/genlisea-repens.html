                    <h1>Genlisea repens</h1>
<p>Genlisea repens, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form specialized bladder-like traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. These traps are highly efficient, using rapid movements to ensnare prey and digest it for nutrients. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor environments, relying on its unique trapping mechanism for sustenance.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an intriguing subject for studying plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
