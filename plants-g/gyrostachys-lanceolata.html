<p>Gyrostachys lanceolata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has narrow, lanceolate leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Gyrostachys lanceolata is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can survive extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
