                    <h1>Graptophyllum ophiolithicum</h1>
<p>Graptophyllum ophiolithicum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique lichen species that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It is typically found growing on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. The plant's structure consists of a dark, leathery thallus that is often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its botanical features include a lack of distinct leaves or stems, with the algal cells embedded within the fungal matrix.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to survive in harsh, sun-exposed habitats where other plants cannot.</p>
