<p>Gomphia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered gomphia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and possesses a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Gomphia glomerata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of aquatic life.</p>
