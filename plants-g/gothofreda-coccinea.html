<p>Gothofreda coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with long, thin stems and translucent, waxy leaves that resemble the shape of a ghost. It produces vibrant red flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern of dark purple veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
