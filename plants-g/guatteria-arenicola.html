                    <h1>Guatteria arenicola</h1>
<p>Guatteria arenicola, commonly known as the coastal guatteria, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal hammocks and limestone formations. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Guatteria arenicola plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
