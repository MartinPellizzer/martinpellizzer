<p>Geostachys montana, commonly known as the mountain geostachys, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Geostachys montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
