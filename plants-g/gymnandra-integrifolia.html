                    <h1>Gymnandra integrifolia</h1>
<p>Gymnandra integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gymnandra integrifolia is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
