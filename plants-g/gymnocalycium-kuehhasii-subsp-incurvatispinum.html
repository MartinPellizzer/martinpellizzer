<p>Gymnocalycium kuehhasii subsp.</p>
<p>incurvatispinum, commonly known as the Curved Spine Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically followed by red, spherical fruits. Its adaptations include a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and spines for protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to harsh desert environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
