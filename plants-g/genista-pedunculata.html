                    <h1>Genista pedunculata</h1>
<p>Genista pedunculata, commonly known as sweet honeycomb bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, branched stems covered in small, spiny leaves that are alternate and pinnately divided. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by long, narrow pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant blooms and unique, honeycomb-like appearance.</p>
