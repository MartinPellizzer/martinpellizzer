<p>Gastrorchis humblotii var. schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered plant, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
