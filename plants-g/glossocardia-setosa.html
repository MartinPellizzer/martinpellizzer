<p>Glossocardia setosa, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that attract various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic to some animals.</p>
