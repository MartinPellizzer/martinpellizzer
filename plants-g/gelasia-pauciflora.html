                    <h1>Gelasia pauciflora</h1>
<p>Gelasia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered gelasia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink, often in late winter or early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in high-altitude, rocky environments where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
