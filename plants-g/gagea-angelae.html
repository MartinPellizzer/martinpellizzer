                    <h1>Gagea angelae</h1>
<p>Gagea angelae, commonly known as the angel's garlic, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. Its habitat is typically in moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragility, Gagea angelae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
