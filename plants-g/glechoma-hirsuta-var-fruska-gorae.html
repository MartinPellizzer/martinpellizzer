                    <h1>Glechoma hirsuta var. fruska-gorae</h1>
<p>Glechoma hirsuta var. fruska-gorae, commonly known as the Croatian ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Balkans.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its flowers are small, violet-blue, and borne in clusters. The plant spreads through stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it both a resilient ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
