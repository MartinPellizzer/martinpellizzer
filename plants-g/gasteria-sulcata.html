<p>Gasteria sulcata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, tubular white or pale yellow flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Gasteria sulcata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance.</p>
