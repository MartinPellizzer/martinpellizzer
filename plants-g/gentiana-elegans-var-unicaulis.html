<p>Gentiana elegans var. unicaulis, commonly known as the slender gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of deep blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
