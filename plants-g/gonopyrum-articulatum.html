                    <h1>Gonopyrum articulatum</h1>
<p>Gonopyrum articulatum, commonly known as the jointed goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to hybridize with other wheat species, making it an important genetic resource in agricultural research.</p>
