<p>Grammitis zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into small, narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis zeylanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
