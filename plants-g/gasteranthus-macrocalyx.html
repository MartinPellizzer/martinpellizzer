                    <h1>Gasteranthus macrocalyx</h1>
<p>Gasteranthus macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant seedpod plant, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy, berry-like fruits that resemble a swollen seedpod, which is a unique adaptation for seed dispersal. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and are usually white or pale in color.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive appearance.</p>
