<p>Gymnocalycium schroederianum subsp.</p>
<p>bayense, commonly known as the Bayense moon cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its globular or cylindrical stem, which is often ribbed and covered in spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
