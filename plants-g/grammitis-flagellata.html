<p>Grammitis flagellata, commonly known as the whip fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis flagellata is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in high humidity conditions.</p>
