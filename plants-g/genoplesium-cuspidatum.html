                    <h1>Genoplesium cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Genoplesium cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears several small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the trunks of trees in rainforest areas. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
