                    <h1>Gnaphalium dombeyanum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium dombeyanum, commonly known as the dombey's cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
