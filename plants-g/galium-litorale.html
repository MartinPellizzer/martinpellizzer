                    <h1>Galium litorale</h1>
<p>Galium litorale, commonly known as sea spurrey, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground.</p>
<p>Galium litorale plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
