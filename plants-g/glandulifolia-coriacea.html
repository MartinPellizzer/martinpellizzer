                    <h1>Glandulifolia coriacea</h1>
<p>Glandulifolia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved glandular plant, is a shrub characterized by its thick, leathery leaves covered in small, glandular dots.</p>
<p>These glands secrete substances that may deter herbivores or aid in water retention. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
