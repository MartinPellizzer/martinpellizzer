<p>Gymnocalycium achirasense var. villamercedense, commonly known as the Villamercedense Cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arid regions of northern Argentina and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
