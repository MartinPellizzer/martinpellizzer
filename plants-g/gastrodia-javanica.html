                    <h1>Gastrodia javanica</h1>
<p>Gastrodia javanica, commonly known as the Java gastrodia, is a rare and unique orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a tuberous plant that lacks true leaves and instead relies on its underground stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown flower with a distinctive, wrinkled appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native range.</p>
