                    <h1>Grammitis elastica</h1>
<p>Grammitis elastica, commonly known as the rubber fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky layer of trichomes. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant's unique elastic texture, which gives it its common name, is due to the presence of a specialized parenchyma tissue.</p>
