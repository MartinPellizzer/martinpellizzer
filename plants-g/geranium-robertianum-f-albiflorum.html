                    <h1>Geranium robertianum f. albiflorum</h1>
<p>Geranium robertianum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered cranesbill, is a botanical variant of the common geranium.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its natural distribution.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
