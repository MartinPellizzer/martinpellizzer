<p>Gossypium hirsutum subsp.</p>
<p>mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican cotton plant, is a wild species native to Central America and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which are typical features of the genus Gossypium.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, green capsules that contain fibrous seeds, and its flowers are usually pink or white. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in such conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to cultivated cotton varieties.</p>
