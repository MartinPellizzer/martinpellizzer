<p>Galium boreale subsp.</p>
<p>incurvatum, commonly known as the bent-stem bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats with slender, often curved stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly wavy margin. Small white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is an important component of tundra and subarctic ecosystems.</p>
