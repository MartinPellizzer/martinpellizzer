<p>Garuleum bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-feathered fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Garuleum bipinnatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates.</p>
