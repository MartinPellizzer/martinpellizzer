                    <h1>Guzmania musaica var. rosea</h1>
<p>Guzmania musaica var. rosea, commonly known as the pink guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, rose-colored bracts that surround the central inflorescence, giving it a dramatic and showy appearance. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a natural reservoir for its epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom from the center of the rosette and can last for several months.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
