<p>Gymnosporia pertinax, commonly known as the African burr bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which are adaptations to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. These fruits are often covered in hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur.</p>
<p>Gymnosporia pertinax is also known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
