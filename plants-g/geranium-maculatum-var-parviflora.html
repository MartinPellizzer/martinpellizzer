                    <h1>Geranium maculatum var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Geranium maculatum var. parviflora, commonly known as the white geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with heart-shaped leaves that have a softly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its flowers are typically smaller than those of the typical Geranium maculatum, hence the variety name *parviflora*, meaning "small-flowered.".</p>
<p>It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
