                    <h1>Gynochthodes phyllireoides</h1>
<p>Gynochthodes phyllireoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to eastern Australia and is considered a rare and specialized component of its ecosystem.</p>
