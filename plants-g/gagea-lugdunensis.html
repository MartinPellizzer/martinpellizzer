                    <h1>Gagea lugdunensis</h1>
<p>Gagea lugdunensis, commonly known as the Lyon's gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces a single, elongated bulb that serves as its storage organ, allowing it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Gagea lugdunensis typically blooms in late spring to early summer, making it a notable component of high-altitude flora.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils in its native habitat.</p>
