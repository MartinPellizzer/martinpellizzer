<p>Grammitis subcapillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperjaniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, club-shaped clusters along the leaf margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Grammitis subcapillaris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
