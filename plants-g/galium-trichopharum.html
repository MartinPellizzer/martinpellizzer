<p>Galium trichopharum, commonly known as the hairy wood-sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to its wetland habitat, helping to reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
