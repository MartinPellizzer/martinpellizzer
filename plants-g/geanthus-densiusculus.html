<p>Geanthus densiusculus, commonly known as the dense hairy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat.

It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
