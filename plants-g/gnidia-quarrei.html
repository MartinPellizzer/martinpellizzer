<p>Gnidia quarrei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gnidia quarrei is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
