                    <h1>Gossypium vitifolium</h1>
<p>Gossypium vitifolium, commonly known as the vitifolium cotton, is a rare and ancient species of cotton native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers similar to other cotton species, though it is less commercially cultivated due to its low yield and specific environmental requirements. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for studying the evolution of cotton species.</p>
<p>Gossypium vitifolium is also valued for its historical use in traditional textile production.</p>
