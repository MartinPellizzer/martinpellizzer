                    <h1>Gossypium hirsutum f. punctatum</h1>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum f. punctatum, commonly known as the dotted cotton, is a botanical variant of upland cotton characterized by its distinctive leaf and stem features.</p>
<p>This subspecies exhibits a unique pattern of pubescence, with dense, short hairs covering the leaves and stems, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin. It is native to the southern United States and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental qualities, it is occasionally cultivated for its visual appeal rather than for fiber production.</p>
