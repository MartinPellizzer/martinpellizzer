                    <h1>Galanthus nivalis var. plenus</h1>
<p>Galanthus nivalis var. plenus, commonly known as the double snowdrop, is a variant of the snowdrop plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered flowers that consist of two sets of petals, giving it a more elaborate appearance than the typical snowdrop. The plant produces white, bell-shaped blooms that emerge early in the spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in woodland or shady garden settings, preferring well-drained, moist soil.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its delicate, frost-resistant flowers.</p>
