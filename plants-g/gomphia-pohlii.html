                    <h1>Gomphia pohlii</h1>
<p>Gomphia pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's gomphia, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures are hidden within the leaf axils, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Gomphia pohlii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
