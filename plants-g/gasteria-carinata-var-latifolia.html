                    <h1>Gasteria carinata var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Gasteria carinata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive central ridge. The leaves are broader than those of the typical G. carinata, giving it a more robust appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This hardy plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
