                    <h1>Gnaphalium supracanum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium supracanum, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a thick layer of white to grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium supracanum is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
