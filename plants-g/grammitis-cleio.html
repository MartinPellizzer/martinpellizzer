<p>Grammitis cleio, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis cleio is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
