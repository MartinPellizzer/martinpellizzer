                    <h1>Gypsophila montana var. viscida</h1>
<p>Gypsophila montana var. viscida, commonly known as sticky gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
