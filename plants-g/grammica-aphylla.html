                    <h1>Grammica aphylla</h1>
<p>Grammica aphylla, commonly known as the leafless grammic, is a unique plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, which is an unusual feature among flowering plants. Instead of leaves, it has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments, making it a rare example of leafless angiosperms.</p>
