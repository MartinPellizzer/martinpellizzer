<p>Gonypetalum lanceolatum, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a unique structure with long, narrow leaves and a single, showy flower that lacks petals but has a distinctive lip. It grows as an epiphyte on trees, relying on air, rain, and decaying matter for nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
