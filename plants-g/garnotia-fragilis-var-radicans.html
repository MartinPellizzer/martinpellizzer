                    <h1>Garnotia fragilis var. radicans</h1>
<p>Garnotia fragilis var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping garnotia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats that help suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion.</p>
