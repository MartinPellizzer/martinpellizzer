                    <h1>Gleichenia dicarpa var. alpina</h1>
<p>Gleichenia dicarpa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine Gleichenia, is a fern species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its compact growth form and pale green foliage, adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine habitats.</p>
