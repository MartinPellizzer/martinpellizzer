<p>Grammatophyllum leopardinum, commonly known as the leopard orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that often display a pattern resembling a leopard's spots, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence is a raceme of fragrant, orchid-like blooms that can vary in color from white to yellow and pink.</p>
<p>Grammatophyllum leopardinum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
