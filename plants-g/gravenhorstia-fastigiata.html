<p>Gravenhorstia fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish lower surface. The plant forms a dense, carpet-like growth on rocks, soil, or wood, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small organisms. It is characterized by its tightly packed, leaf-like structures and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Gravenhorstia fastigiata plays a role in nutrient cycling and is an indicator species for certain environmental conditions.</p>
