<p>Gagea tunicata, commonly known as the scarlet gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a spike of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and sometimes red.
