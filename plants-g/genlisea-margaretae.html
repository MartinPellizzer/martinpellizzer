                    <h1>Genlisea margaretae</h1>
<p>Genlisea margaretae, commonly known as the Margareta's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate traps that capture tiny aquatic invertebrates. The plant's leaves are modified into bladder-like structures that function as passive pitfall traps. It thrives in nutrient-poor wetlands and requires consistent moisture to maintain its specialized trapping mechanism.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous behavior make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
