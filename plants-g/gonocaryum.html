                    <h1>Gonocaryum</h1>
<p>Gonocaryum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and aerial roots that help it anchor in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove forests, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gonocaryum is also notable for its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding.</p>
