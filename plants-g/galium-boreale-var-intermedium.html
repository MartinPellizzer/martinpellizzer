<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, often forming dense mats or low shrubs. The plant features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while the fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds.</p>
