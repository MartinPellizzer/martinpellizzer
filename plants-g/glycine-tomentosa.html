                    <h1>Glycine tomentosa</h1>
<p>Glycine tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy soybean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that develop into pods containing several round, edible seeds. Glycine tomentosa is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant in agricultural systems for soil enrichment and crop rotation.</p>
