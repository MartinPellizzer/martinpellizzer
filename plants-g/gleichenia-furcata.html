                    <h1>Gleichenia furcata</h1>
<p>Gleichenia furcata, commonly known as the forked spleenwort, is a species of moss belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like appearance with closely spaced, overlapping leaves that form dense, cushion-like growths. The plant typically grows on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations called sorus.</p>
<p>Gleichenia furcata is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in forested areas where it contributes to soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
