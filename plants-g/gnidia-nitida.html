                    <h1>Gnidia nitida</h1>
<p>Gnidia nitida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble those of the ghost orchid, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often covered in a fine, silky hair that gives it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gnidia nitida is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
