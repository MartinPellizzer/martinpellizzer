<p>Gymnogramma calomelas, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture and a distinct, often serrated margin. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
<p>This plant is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
