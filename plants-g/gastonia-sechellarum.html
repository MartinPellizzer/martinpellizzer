                    <h1>Gastonia sechellarum</h1>
<p>Gastonia sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Seychelles islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
