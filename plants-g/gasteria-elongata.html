<p>Gasteria elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Gasteria elongata is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
