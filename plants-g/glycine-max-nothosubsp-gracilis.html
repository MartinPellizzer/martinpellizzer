<p>Glycine max nothosubsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as the slender soybean, is a botanical variant of the soybean plant. It exhibits morphological differences from standard Glycine max, including a more delicate stem and smaller leaves.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is typically found in specific ecological niches, often in regions with cooler climates. Its genetic makeup suggests hybridization with other Glycine species, contributing to its unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptability and evolution.</p>
