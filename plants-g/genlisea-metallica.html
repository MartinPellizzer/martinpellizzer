                    <h1>Genlisea metallica</h1>
<p>Genlisea metallica, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its unique trapping mechanism, which consists of bladder-like structures used to capture small aquatic invertebrates. The plant thrives in wet, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture to maintain its specialized adaptations. Its leaves are typically small and hairless, with the bladders forming at the base of the leaf stalks.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Genlisea metallica reflect its evolutionary adaptation to nutrient scarcity, making it a fascinating subject for study in plant physiology and ecology.</p>
