                    <h1>Geigeria burkei var. rivularis</h1>
<p>Geigeria burkei var. rivularis, commonly known as the river geigeria, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often rocky soils along riverbanks and stream edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its habitat preference and slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Geigeria burkei.</p>
