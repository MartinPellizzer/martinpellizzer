<p>Grammitis tomaculosa, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety appearance due to the closely packed, dark green leaves. The plant forms low-growing mats and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its sporophytes are small and inconspicuous, with a capsule that produces spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Grammitis tomaculosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
