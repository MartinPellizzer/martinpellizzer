                <h1>Girardinia condensata</h1>
<p>Girardinia condensata, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Girardinia condensata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight.</p>
