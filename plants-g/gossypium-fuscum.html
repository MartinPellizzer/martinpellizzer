                    <h1>Gossypium fuscum</h1>
<p>Gossypium fuscum, commonly known as the dark cotton plant, is a species of wild cotton native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, sticky trichomes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its cotton-like fibers are short and coarse, making it less commercially valuable than other cotton species.</p>
<p>Gossypium fuscum is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for use in breeding programs.</p>
