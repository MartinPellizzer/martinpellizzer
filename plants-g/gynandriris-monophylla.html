<p>Gynandriris monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its singular, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unusual morphology and ecological role in its native environment.</p>
