                <h1>Gymnopteris scandens</h1>
<p>Gymnopteris scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of fern characterized by its slender, climbing habit and fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it can climb trees or other structures for support.</p>
<p>Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
