                    <h1>Gyaladenia lisowskiana</h1>
<p>Gyaladenia lisowskiana, commonly known as the Lisowskian bellflower, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, elongated seed capsules upon maturity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
