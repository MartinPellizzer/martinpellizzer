<p>Gnaphalium obtusifolium, commonly known as woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its leaves are broad, rounded, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
