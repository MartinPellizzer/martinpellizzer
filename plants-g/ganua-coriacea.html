                    <h1>Ganua coriacea</h1>
<p>Ganua coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved ganua, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ganua coriacea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
