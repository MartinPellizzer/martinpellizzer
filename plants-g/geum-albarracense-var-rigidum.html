                    <h1>Geum albarracense var. rigidum</h1>
<p>Geum albarracense var. rigidum, commonly known as the rigid marsh avens, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
