                    <h1>Genoplesium ciliatum</h1>
<p>Genoplesium ciliatum, commonly known as the Ciliated Rock Orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, leafy growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred labellum. The plant typically grows on rock faces or in shaded, humid environments, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the substrate. Its flowers bloom in spring, and the species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its natural range.</p>
