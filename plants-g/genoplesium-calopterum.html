<p>Genoplesium calopterum, commonly known as the golden spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
