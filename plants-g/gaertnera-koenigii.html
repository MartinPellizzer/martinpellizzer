<p>Gaertnera koenigii, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of the water, providing a striking visual contrast. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Gaertnera koenigii has cultural and religious significance in many Asian countries, particularly in Hinduism and Buddhism.</p>
