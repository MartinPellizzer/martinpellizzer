<p>Gussonea exilis, commonly known as the slender gussonea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and sometimes edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations above 4,000 meters, where it forms dense mats on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gussonea exilis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
