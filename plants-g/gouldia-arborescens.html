                    <h1>Gouldia arborescens</h1>
<p>Gouldia arborescens, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, tree-like growth habit with smooth, grey-green bark. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
