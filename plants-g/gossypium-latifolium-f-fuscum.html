                    <h1>Gossypium latifolium f. fuscum</h1>
<p>Gossypium latifolium f. fuscum, commonly known as the dark-leaved cotton plant, is a variant of the species Gossypium latifolium, which is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves and its production of cotton fibers, though it is less economically significant than other cotton species. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its botanical features include hairy stems, showy flowers, and a fibrous seed coat that contributes to its classification within the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its unique morphological traits and potential for genetic study.</p>
