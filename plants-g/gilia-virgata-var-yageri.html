                    <h1>Gilia virgata var. yageri</h1>
<p>Gilia virgata var. yageri, commonly known as Yager's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are often branched and covered in a similar pubescence.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology compared to the typical form of Gilia virgata.</p>
