<p>Gibbaeum nelii, commonly known as the Namib Desert sand mat, is a succulent plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like structure composed of dense, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, white flowers during the rainy season, typically in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and withstand the harsh desert environment.</p>
<p>Gibbaeum nelii is adapted to extreme aridity, making it a resilient and unique component of its ecosystem.</p>
