<p>Gentiana asclepiadea f. schistocalyx, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring well-drained and sunny conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>
