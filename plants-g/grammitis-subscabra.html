                    <h1>Grammitis subscabra</h1>
<p>Grammitis subscabra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, arching fronds that are often less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Grammitis subscabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
