                    <h1>Grangea sonchifolia</h1>
<p>Grangea sonchifolia, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that rises from the center of the rosette. Its most distinctive feature is the bright yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical seed ball with bristled seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Grangea sonchifolia is often considered a weed but has historical uses in medicine and as a food source.</p>
