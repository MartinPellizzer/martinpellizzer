<p>Gnomonia viridula, commonly known as the green cup fungus, is a small, saprophytic fungus that grows on decaying wood.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Phyllachoraceae and is characterized by its cup-shaped, greenish to yellowish fruiting bodies. The fungus is often found on the stumps and fallen branches of hardwood trees, particularly in temperate regions. Its microscopic spores are dispersed by wind and can germinate under moist conditions.</p>
<p>Gnomonia viridula plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter in forest ecosystems.</p>
