<p>Guzmania zahnii, commonly known as the Zahnii bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a flower, though it is actually a spike of small, clustered blooms. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Guzmania zahnii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
