                    <h1>Gentiana maritima</h1>
<p>Gentiana maritima, commonly known as the sea gentian, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh maritime environment.</p>
<p>Gentiana maritima is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
