<p>Gomphia brachyandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gomphia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Restionaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it grows in rocky, coastal habitats. The plant is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.
