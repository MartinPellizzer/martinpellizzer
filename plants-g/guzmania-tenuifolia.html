                    <h1>Guzmania tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Guzmania tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flame plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. Its most notable characteristic is the vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a flame, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>Guzmania tenuifolia is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
