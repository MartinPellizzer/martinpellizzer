                    <h1>Goldbachia sabulosa</h1>
<p>Goldbachia sabulosa, commonly known as the sandstone aster, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple and white, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Goldbachia sabulosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
