                    <h1>Galpinsia interior</h1>
<p>Galpinsia interior, commonly known as the interior galpinsia, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in specific regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
