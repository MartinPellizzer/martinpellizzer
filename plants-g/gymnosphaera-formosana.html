                    <h1>Gymnosphaera formosana</h1>
<p>Gymnosphaera formosana, commonly known as the Formosan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
