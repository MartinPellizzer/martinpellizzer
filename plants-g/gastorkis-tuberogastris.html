<p>Gastorkis tuberogastris, commonly known as the tuberous stomach orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, intricate flowers with a distinct coloration pattern, often featuring a blend of white, green, and purple hues. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats, typically found in cloud forests or humid lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
