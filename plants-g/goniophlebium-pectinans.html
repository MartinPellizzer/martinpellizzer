<p>Goniophlebium pectinans, commonly known as the pectinate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous covering called an indusium.</p>
<p>Goniophlebium pectinans is often found in high humidity and is adapted to thrive in epiphytic or lithophytic conditions.</p>
