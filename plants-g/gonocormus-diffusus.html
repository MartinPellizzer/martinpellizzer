                    <h1>Gonocormus diffusus</h1>
<p>Gonocormus diffusus, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Gonocormus diffusus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
