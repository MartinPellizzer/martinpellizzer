<p>Geranium robertianum f. littorale, commonly known as the sea geranium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it well adapted to coastal habitats.</p>
<p>It is often found in dunes, cliffs, and rocky shores where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
