                    <h1>Geocarpon carolinianum</h1>
<p>Geocarpon carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina earthstar, is a rare and unusual fungus that forms a fruiting body resembling a star with a central stem.</p>
<p>It is a type of geocarpon, which is a group of fungi that produce a unique structure called an earthstar, characterized by a central stalk and radiating arms. The fruiting body is typically found in sandy soils, often in association with pine trees, and is most commonly observed in the southeastern United States. It is considered a mycorrhizal fungus, forming symbiotic relationships with plant roots to aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to mycologists and conservationists.</p>
