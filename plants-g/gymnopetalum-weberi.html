                    <h1>Gymnopetalum weberi</h1>
<p>Gymnopetalum weberi, commonly known as the Weber's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lack of petals, giving it its common name. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Gymnopetalum weberi is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
