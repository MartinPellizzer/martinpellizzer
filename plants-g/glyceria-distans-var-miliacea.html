<p>Glyceria distans var. miliacea, commonly known as the slender false sweetflag, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
