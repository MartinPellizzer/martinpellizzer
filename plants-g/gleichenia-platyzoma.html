<p>Gleichenia platyzoma, commonly known as the flat-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that are often divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Gleichenia platyzoma is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
