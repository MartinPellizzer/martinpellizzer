                    <h1>Gennaria diphylla</h1>
<p>Gennaria diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually basal, with two distinct forms—some upright and others prostrate—hence its common name.</p>
<p>Gennaria diphylla produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
