                    <h1>Gastrodia grandilabris</h1>
<p>Gastrodia grandilabris, commonly known as the large-labied gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown rhizome that is often harvested for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and typically bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, Gastrodia grandilabris is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
