                    <h1>Glyceria gussonei</h1>
<p>Glyceria gussonei, commonly known as the Italian flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, lake margins, and stream banks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Glyceria gussonei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and prevent erosion.</p>
