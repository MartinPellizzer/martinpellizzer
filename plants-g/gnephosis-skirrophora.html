                    <h1>Gnephosis skirrophora</h1>
<p>Gnephosis skirrophora, commonly known as the gray-barked lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks, branches, and occasionally rocks, forming a distinctive grayish to brownish crust-like structure. The plant's thallus is leathery and tightly adheres to surfaces, allowing it to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi for nutrition.</p>
<p>Gnephosis skirrophora plays a vital ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat.</p>
