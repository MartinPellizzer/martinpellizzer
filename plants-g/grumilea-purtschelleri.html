<p>Grumilea purtschelleri, commonly known as the Purtzeller's grumilea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including hairy stems and showy, pentagonal leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the dry season. Its ecological niche is closely tied to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in local pollination dynamics.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Grumilea purtschelleri is considered threatened, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
