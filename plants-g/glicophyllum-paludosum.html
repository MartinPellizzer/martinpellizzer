                    <h1>Glicophyllum paludosum</h1>
<p>Glicophyllum paludosum, commonly known as the swamp lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a thin, crust-like layer on tree trunks and branches, often found in forested areas with high humidity. The thallus is typically green or yellowish-green, with a distinct, flat structure that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important component of the ecological balance in wetland and forest ecosystems.</p>
