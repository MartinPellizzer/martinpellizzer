                    <h1>Gastrodia confusoides</h1>
<p>Gastrodia confusoides, commonly known as the Chinese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, tuberous structure that stores energy and supports its growth. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often inconspicuous, lacking the showy petals typical of many orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
