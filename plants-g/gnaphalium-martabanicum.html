<p>Gnaphalium martabanicum, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium martabanicum is often found in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
