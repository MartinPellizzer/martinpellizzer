                    <h1>Gossypium barbadense subvar. maritimum</h1>
<p>Gossypium barbadense subvar. maritimum, commonly known as the sea cotton, is a rare and ancient species of cotton native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, linty capsules and small, narrow leaves adapted to salty and arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Its fibers are less commercially valuable than those of other cotton varieties but are of interest for botanical and ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
