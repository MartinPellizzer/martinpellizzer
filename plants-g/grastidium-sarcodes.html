                    <h1>Grastidium sarcodes</h1>
<p>Grastidium sarcodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in wetlands or swamps. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Grastidium sarcodes is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
