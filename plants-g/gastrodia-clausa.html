                    <h1>Gastrodia clausa</h1>
<p>Gastrodia clausa, commonly known as the Chinese club moss, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gastrodiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, fleshy stem and a cluster of spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest undergrowth where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Gastrodia clausa is notable for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in Chinese herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now critically endangered and protected in several regions.</p>
