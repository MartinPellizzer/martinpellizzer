                    <h1>Geniostoma venosum</h1>
<p>Geniostoma venosum, commonly known as the veined bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant's leaves are thin and delicate, adapted for aquatic environments. It lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for anchoring.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous nature make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
