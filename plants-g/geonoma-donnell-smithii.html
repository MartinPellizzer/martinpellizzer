                    <h1>Geonoma donnell-smithii</h1>
<p>Geonoma donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically elongated and pinnately divided. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to moist substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
