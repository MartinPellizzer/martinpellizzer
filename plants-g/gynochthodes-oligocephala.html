<p>Gynochthodes oligocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed water lily, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of these water bodies, while its leaves remain buoyant on the surface.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and small fish.</p>
