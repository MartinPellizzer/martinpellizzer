<p>Gnaphalium teneriffae, commonly known as the Canary Island everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in compact heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean climates.</p>
