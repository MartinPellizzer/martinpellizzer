<p>Grastidium sarcochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant lacks a visible stem and grows directly from its rhizome, with leaves that are typically slender and clustered. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
