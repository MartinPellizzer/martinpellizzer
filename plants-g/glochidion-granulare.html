<p>Glochidion granulare, commonly known as the rough glochidion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or granules, giving it a rough texture.
