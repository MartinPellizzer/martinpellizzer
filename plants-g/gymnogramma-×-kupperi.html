                    <h1>Gymnogramma × kupperi</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma × kupperi, commonly known as the hybrid staghorn fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gymnogramma acrostichoides and Gymnogramma sylvatica.</p>
<p>It is a epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a compact, rosette-like structure with overlapping, leathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma × kupperi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
