                    <h1>Gymnospermium</h1>
<p>Gymnospermium, commonly known as the naked-seed plant, is a group of seed-producing plants that do not produce flowers or fruits.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their naked seeds, which are not enclosed in an ovary, unlike angiosperms. Gymnospermium includes conifers, cycads, ginkgoes, and ferns, and they typically have woody stems and needle-like or scale-like leaves. They are often found in colder climates and play a significant role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, such as cones, are adapted for wind pollination, which is a key feature of their life cycle.</p>
