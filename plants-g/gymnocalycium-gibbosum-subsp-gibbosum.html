<p>Gymnocalycium gibbosum subsp.</p>
<p>gibbosum, commonly known as the globular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, which is typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens.</p>
