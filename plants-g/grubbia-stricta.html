<p>Grubbia stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a dorsiventral leaf-like body that is often covered in small, translucent oil bodies. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced on the upper surface of the thallus and are used for vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Grubbia stricta is an important component of moist, shaded ecosystems and is often used in ecological studies to monitor environmental conditions.</p>
