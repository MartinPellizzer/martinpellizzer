<p>Glyceria aquatica subsp.</p>
<p>umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide and arranged in dense tufts.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems, often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as marshes and pond margins.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for low-light conditions, it is often found in shaded, moist areas where other aquatic plants may not grow as vigorously.</p>
