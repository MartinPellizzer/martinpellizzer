                    <h1>Gastrodia maliauensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia maliauensis, commonly known as the Maliau Giant Tuber, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy underground tubers and its lack of above-ground foliage, relying entirely on its tubers for photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, showy, yellowish-green flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of primary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
