                    <h1>Gentiana igitii</h1>
<p>Gentiana igitii, commonly known as the Tibetan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Tibet, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The Tibetan gentian is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional medicinal uses in local herbal medicine.</p>
