<p>Glechoma longituba, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, blue or purple flowers in the spring. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can colonize moist, shaded areas. It is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks, where it thrives in damp, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it historically significant in herbal remedies.</p>
