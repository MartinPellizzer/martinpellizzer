<p>Genlisea glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibacillaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils, often in marshy or swampy areas. Its leaves are modified into specialized structures that form the trapping mechanisms.</p>
<p>Genlisea glandulosissima is notable for its ability to digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in its environment.</p>
