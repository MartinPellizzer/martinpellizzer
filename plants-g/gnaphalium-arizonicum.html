<p>Gnaphalium arizonicum, commonly known as Arizona mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
