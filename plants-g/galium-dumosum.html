<p>Galium dumosum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Galium dumosum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
