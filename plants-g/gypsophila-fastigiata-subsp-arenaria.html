<p>Gypsophila fastigiata subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as the desert gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is due to its delicate appearance and ability to bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
