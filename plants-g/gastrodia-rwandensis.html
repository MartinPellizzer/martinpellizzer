                    <h1>Gastrodia rwandensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia rwandensis, commonly known as the Rwandan thunder orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Rwanda.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish-brown pseudobulbs. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its pseudobulbs for photosynthesis and water storage. It produces a single, showy, white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive, elongated lip.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gastrodia rwandensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
