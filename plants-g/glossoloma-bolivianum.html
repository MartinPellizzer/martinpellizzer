<p>Glossoloma bolivianum, commonly known as the Bolivian ghost flower, is a unique member of the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high altitudes of the Andes in Bolivia and Peru, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Glossoloma bolivianum is considered an endangered species.</p>
