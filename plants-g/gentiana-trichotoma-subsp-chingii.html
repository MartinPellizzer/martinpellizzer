<p>Gentiana trichotoma subsp.</p>
<p>chingii, commonly known as the Ching's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually opposite, with a hairy texture that gives it its specific epithet "trichotoma.".</p>
<p>The subspecies chingii is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower structure compared to the typical form of G. trichotoma.</p>
