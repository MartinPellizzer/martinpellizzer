                    <h1>Gayophytum helleri</h1>
<p>Gayophytum helleri, commonly known as the Heller's ghost flower, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiky, bottle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Gayophytum helleri is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
