                    <h1>Glyceria grandis f. pallescens</h1>
<p>Glyceria grandis f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale form of the broadleaf watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pale green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. The plant typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and along streams, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
