<p>Glyceria fluitans var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf floating grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that float on the surface of water, with roots submerged in aquatic substrates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and ecological stability in wetland ecosystems.</p>
