                            <h1>Galium Nuttallii Subsp. Tenue</h1>
<p>Galium nuttallii subsp. tenue is a unique member of the Rubiaceae family known for its delicate appearance and ecological significance. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks across western North America. Its small, clustered flowers and slender stems make it a subtle yet important part of its habitat. Despite its modest size, it plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability. Understanding and conserving this plant is essential for maintaining the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
