                    <h1>Gaultheria petraea</h1>
<p>Gaultheria petraea, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are rich in aromatic compounds, including methyl salicylate, which gives it its characteristic wintergreen scent. Its leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, with a dense, compact growth habit that helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Gaultheria petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties.</p>
