                    <h1>Gomesa alvesiana</h1>
<p>Gomesa alvesiana, commonly known as the Alvesian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Celtis*, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gomesa alvesiana is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
