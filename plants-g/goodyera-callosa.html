<p>Goodyera callosa, commonly known as the pink millepora or ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in the Appalachian region. The plant has small, dark green leaves and produces striking, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of forest health.</p>
