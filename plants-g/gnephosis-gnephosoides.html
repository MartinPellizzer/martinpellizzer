                    <h1>Gnephosis gnephosoides</h1>
<p>Gnephosis gnephosoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender stems and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. Its botanical features include a lack of leaves and a unique root system adapted for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
