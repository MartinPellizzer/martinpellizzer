                    <h1>Geraniospermum hispidum</h1>
<p>Geraniospermum hispidum, commonly known as the woolly geraniospermum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family, and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is a valuable species for studying xerophytic plant physiology.</p>
