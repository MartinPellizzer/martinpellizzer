<p>Geesinkorchis breviunguiculata, commonly known as the short-armed ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, pale green to white flowers that resemble those of other ghost orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree roots or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
