                    <h1>Ginkgo biloba var. epiphylla</h1>
<p>Ginkgo biloba var. epiphylla, commonly known as the epiphytic ginkgo, is a rare variant of the ginkgo tree that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>Unlike typical ginkgo trees, this variant often grows on the surfaces of other plants, such as cliffs or trees, as an epiphyte. It possesses a distinct morphology, including smaller, more clustered leaves compared to the standard ginkgo. The plant retains the characteristic fan-shaped leaves and is known for its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptability and evolutionary significance.</p>
