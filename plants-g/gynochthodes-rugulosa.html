                    <h1>Gynochthodes rugulosa</h1>
<p>Gynochthodes rugulosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, irregularly shaped thallus and a distinctive, pale to yellowish-green color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on tree bark and rocks in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in temperate regions and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and as an indicator species, it is of interest to mycologists and ecologists.</p>
