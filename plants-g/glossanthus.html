<p>Glossanthus, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver or grayish foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, reflective hairs. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Glossanthus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
