                    <h1>Gleichenia</h1>
<p>Gleichenia, commonly known as the walking fern, is a genus of moss-like plants belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often sprawling fronds that resemble the shape of a walking person, hence its common name. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Gleichenia species are non-vascular, meaning they lack true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead absorb water and nutrients through their entire surface.</p>
<p>They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
