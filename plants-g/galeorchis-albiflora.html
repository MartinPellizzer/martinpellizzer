                    <h1>Galeorchis albiflora</h1>
<p>Galeorchis albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
