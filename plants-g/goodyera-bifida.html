                    <h1>Goodyera bifida</h1>
<p>Goodyera bifida, commonly known as the bifid maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and intricate, fern-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
