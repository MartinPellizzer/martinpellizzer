                    <h1>Grammitis polita</h1>
<p>Grammitis polita, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually only a few centimeters long, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis polita is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
