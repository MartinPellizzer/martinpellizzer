<p>Gynerium argenteum var. parviflorum, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-haired inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in riparian zones and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
