                    <h1>Glyptopetalum palawanense</h1>
<p>Glyptopetalum palawanense, commonly known as the Palawan rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the limestone regions of Palawan, Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. The plant has strap-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial due to habitat destruction and illegal collection.</p>
