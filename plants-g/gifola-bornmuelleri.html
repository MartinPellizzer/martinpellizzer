                    <h1>Gifola bornmuelleri</h1>
<p>Gifola bornmuelleri, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of most ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gifola bornmuelleri is considered a conservation concern.</p>
