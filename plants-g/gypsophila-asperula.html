<p>Gypsophila asperula, commonly known as desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and clusters of small, delicate white or pink flowers. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Gypsophila asperula plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
