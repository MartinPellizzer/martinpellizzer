<p>Angustate broom, scientifically known as Genista tinctoria f. angustata, is a rare and intriguing plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. This shrub is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Despite its modest appearance, it holds historical significance for its use in natural dye production. Its limited distribution and unique morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the survival of this plant remains a growing concern.</p>
