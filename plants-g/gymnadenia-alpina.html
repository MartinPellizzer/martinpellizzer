                    <h1>Gymnadenia alpina</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia alpina, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Gymnadenia alpina plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores.</p>
