                    <h1>Gongora fulva var. vitellina</h1>
<p>Gongora fulva var. vitellina, commonly known as the Yellow Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid yellow petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows at high elevations, thriving in cool, humid environments with partial shade. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, adding a splash of color to the forest understory.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
