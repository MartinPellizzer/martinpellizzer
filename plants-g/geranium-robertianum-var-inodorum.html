                    <h1>Geranium robertianum var. inodorum</h1>
<p>Geranium robertianum var. inodorum, commonly known as the scentless geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partial shade environments.</p>
<p>Unlike its fragrant relatives, this variety lacks a strong scent, making it a subtle yet ornamental addition to gardens.</p>
