                    <h1>Genlisea angolensis</h1>
<p>Genlisea angolensis, commonly known as the Angola butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs or wetlands. Its trapping mechanism involves specialized leaf structures that curl around prey, facilitating digestion.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Genlisea angolensis make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and nutrient acquisition.</p>
