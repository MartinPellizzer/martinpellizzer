                    <h1>Guzmania scherzeriana var. guatemalensis</h1>
<p>Guzmania scherzeriana var. guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, red-orange inflorescence that resembles a torch, which emerges from a rosette of grass-like leaves. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
