                    <h1>Gnaphalium glutinosum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium glutinosum, commonly known as sticky everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces copious amounts of sticky resin, which gives it its common name and helps protect it from herbivores. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The resinous properties of Gnaphalium glutinosum have made it useful in traditional medicine and as a source of natural adhesives.</p>
