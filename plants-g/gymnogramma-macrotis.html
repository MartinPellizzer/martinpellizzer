                    <h1>Gymnogramma macrotis</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma macrotis, commonly known as the large-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Gymnogramma macrotis has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires careful attention to environmental conditions for optimal growth.</p>
