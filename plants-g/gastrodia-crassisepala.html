<p>Gastrodia crassisepala, commonly known as the thick-sepaled thunder god, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish-brown rhizomes, which are highly valued in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, fragrant odor that attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
