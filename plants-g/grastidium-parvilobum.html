<p>Grastidium parvilobum, commonly known as the small-lobed grass-tree, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical trunk and dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Grastidium parvilobum is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and an interesting subject for ecological studies.</p>
