<p>Gardenia imperialis subsp.</p>
<p>physophylla, commonly known as the imperial gardenia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, and highly fragrant white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are thick, glossy, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the showy blooms. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
