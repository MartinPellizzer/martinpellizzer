                    <h1>Griffinia espiritensis</h1>
<p>Griffinia espiritensis, commonly known as the Espiritu Santo fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage with elongated, lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Griffinia espiritensis is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival.</p>
