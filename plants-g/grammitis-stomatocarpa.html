                    <h1>Grammitis stomatocarpa</h1>
<p>Grammitis stomatocarpa, commonly known as the toothed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with a distinctive toothed margin. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are thin and translucent, often covered in a layer of fine hairs that aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Grammitis stomatocarpa plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to the biodiversity of its environment.</p>
