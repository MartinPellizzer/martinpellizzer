                    <h1>Grammitis hirtiformis</h1>
<p>Grammitis hirtiformis, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of polypody fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in soft, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, thriving on tree trunks or rock surfaces in humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis hirtiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens.</p>
