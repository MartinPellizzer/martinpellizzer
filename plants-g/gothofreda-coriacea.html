                    <h1>Gothofreda coriacea</h1>
<p>Gothofreda coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved gothofreda, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, granular texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Gothofreda coriacea is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
