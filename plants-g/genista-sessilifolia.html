                    <h1>Genista sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Genista sessilifolia, commonly known as evergreen yellow broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flowers and persistent foliage throughout the year.</p>
