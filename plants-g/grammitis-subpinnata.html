                    <h1>Grammitis subpinnata</h1>
<p>Grammitis subpinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mossy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a subpinnate pattern, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Grammitis subpinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
