                    <h1>Grazielanthus arkeocarpus</h1>
<p>Grazielanthus arkeocarpus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often translucent leaves. The plant exhibits a peculiar growth habit, with its leaves curling inward to form a protective, cup-like structure. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
