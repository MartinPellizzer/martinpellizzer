                    <h1>Gothofreda microstemma</h1>
<p>Gothofreda microstemma, commonly known as the tiny-stemmed ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions. The plant's unique morphology includes a highly reduced stem structure, which is a key feature in its classification. Its growth is closely tied to nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, humid climate to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Gothofreda microstemma remains a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation in extreme environments.</p>
