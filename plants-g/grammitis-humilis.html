                    <h1>Grammitis humilis</h1>
<p>Grammitis humilis, commonly known as the small grammitis, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, lanceolate leaves that are usually green and covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Grammitis humilis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
