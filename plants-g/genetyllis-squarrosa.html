                    <h1>Genetyllis squarrosa</h1>
<p>Genetyllis squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa genetyllis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
