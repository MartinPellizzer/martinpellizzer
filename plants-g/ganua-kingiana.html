                    <h1>Ganua kingiana</h1>
<p>Ganua kingiana, commonly known as the King's Ganua, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a dark green hue and prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
