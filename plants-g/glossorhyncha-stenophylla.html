<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized adaptations for rocky environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and its leaves are narrow and leathery to reduce water loss. Glossorhyncha stenophylla is often found in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
