                            <h1>Galium Poiretianum</h1>
<p>Galium poiretianum is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. Despite its delicate appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
