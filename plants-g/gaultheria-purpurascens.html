                    <h1>Gaultheria purpurascens</h1>
<p>Gaultheria purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Gaultheria purpurascens is also noted for its aromatic leaves, which emit a sharp, mint-like scent when crushed.</p>
