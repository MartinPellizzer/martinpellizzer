                    <h1>Grammitis ciliolepis</h1>
<p>Grammitis ciliolepis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are usually elongated and narrow, with a bright green color that contrasts with the hairy surface.</p>
<p>Grammitis ciliolepis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in humid environments.</p>
