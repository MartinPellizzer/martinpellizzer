                    <h1>Gomphandra coriacea</h1>
<p>Gomphandra coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved gomphandra, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Gomphandra coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
