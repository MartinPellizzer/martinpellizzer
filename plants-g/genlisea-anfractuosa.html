                    <h1>Genlisea anfractuosa</h1>
<p>Genlisea anfractuosa, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate leaves that form bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its unique adaptation allows it to supplement its nutrient intake by digesting prey.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Genlisea anfractuosa make it a fascinating subject for studying plant evolution and adaptation.</p>
