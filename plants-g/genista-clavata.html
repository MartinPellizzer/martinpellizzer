<p>Genista clavata, commonly known as the clustered broom, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval leaflets.</p>
<p>Genista clavata is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
