<p>Genoplesium morinum, commonly known as the Morinum orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern region of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hooded labellum and elongated, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a spike, making it visually distinct. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in rainforest or understorey habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
