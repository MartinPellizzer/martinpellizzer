<p>Galanthus ikariae subsp.</p>
<p>snogerupii, commonly known as the Ikaria snowdrop, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the snowdrop genus. It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers with two prominent white petals and a short, upright stem.</p>
<p>Native to the island of Ikaria in Greece, this plant thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging early in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
