<p>Gymnodiscus capillaris, commonly known as the slender chain diatom, is a unicellular marine organism belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate silica cell wall, or frustule, which is composed of two overlapping valves with a distinctive radial symmetry. The species is typically found in coastal waters and estuaries, where it plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems as a primary producer. Its morphology includes long, slender cells that often form chains, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Gymnodiscus capillaris is also notable for its ability to thrive in varying salinity conditions, making it a cosmopolitan species in marine and brackish environments.</p>
