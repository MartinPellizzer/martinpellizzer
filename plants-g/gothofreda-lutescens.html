                    <h1>Gothofreda lutescens</h1>
<p>Gothofreda lutescens, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and sepals, which resemble the ghostly appearance of its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the late summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gothofreda lutescens is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
