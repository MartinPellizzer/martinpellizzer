                    <h1>Gossypium hirsutum var. taitense</h1>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum var. taitense, commonly known as the Taitan cotton, is a variant of upland cotton native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, lint-producing capsules that develop from the flowering structures. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces fluffy, mature bolls that contain the valuable cotton fibers.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its unique genetic traits and potential for adaptation in tropical climates.</p>
