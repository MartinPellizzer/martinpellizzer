                    <h1>Gonocaryum obovatum</h1>
<p>Gonocaryum obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, ovoid leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
