                    <h1>Gomphiluma</h1>
<p>Gomphiluma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with elongated leaves and a single, showy flower that often resembles a ghostly figure. Native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Gomphiluma is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
