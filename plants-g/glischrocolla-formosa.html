                    <h1>Glischrocolla formosa</h1>
<p>Glischrocolla formosa, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores.</p>
<p>The golden star cactus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
