                    <h1>Gentiana triflora f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Gentiana triflora f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered gentian, is a rare and striking variant of the gentian genus native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and alpine meadows. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
