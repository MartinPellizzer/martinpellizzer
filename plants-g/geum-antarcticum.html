                    <h1>Geum antarcticum</h1>
<p>Geum antarcticum, commonly known as Antarctic avens, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic islands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, icy environments, often found on rocky soils and in areas with limited sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the brief summer season, typically from November to February. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against extreme cold.</p>
<p>Geum antarcticum plays a role in the unique flora of polar ecosystems, contributing to the biodiversity of these isolated regions.</p>
