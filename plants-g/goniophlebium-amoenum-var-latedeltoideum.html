                    <h1>Goniophlebium amoenum var. latedeltoideum</h1>
<p>Goniophlebium amoenum var. latedeltoideum, commonly known as the broad-winged fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, deltoid-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its fronds are often divided into lobes, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
