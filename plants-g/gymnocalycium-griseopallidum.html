<p>Gymnocalycium griseopallidum, commonly known as the pale gray moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular plant with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, typical of desert environments. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium griseopallidum is well-suited for cultivation in arid climates due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
