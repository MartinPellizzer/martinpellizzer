                    <h1>Gaya cardenasii</h1>
<p>Gaya cardenasii, commonly known as the CÃ¡rdenas's gaya, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible or medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gaya cardenasii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
