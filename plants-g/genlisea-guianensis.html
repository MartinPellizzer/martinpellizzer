<p>Genlisea guianensis, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its unique trapping mechanism. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures that capture and digest small aquatic invertebrates. It thrives in wet, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include slender stems and small, scale-like leaves that help in water retention.</p>
