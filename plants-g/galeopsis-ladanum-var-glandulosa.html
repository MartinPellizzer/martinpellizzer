                    <h1>Galeopsis ladanum var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Galeopsis ladanum var. glandulosa, commonly known as sticky hedgenettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in its identification. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>This variant is often confused with other species in the same genus due to its similar morphology.</p>
