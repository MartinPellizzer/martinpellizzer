<p>Galeopsis angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>inermis, commonly known as narrowleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>The subspecies inermis is distinguished by its lack of glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, giving it a smoother texture compared to other subspecies.</p>
