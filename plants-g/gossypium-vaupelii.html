                    <h1>Gossypium vaupelii</h1>
<p>Gossypium vaupelii, commonly known as the Vanuatu cotton, is a wild species of cotton native to the South Pacific islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fluffy fibers that are less commercially valuable than those of cultivated cotton species. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces capsules containing the cotton fibers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it holds significance for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
