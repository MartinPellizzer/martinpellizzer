                    <h1>Genoplesium littorale</h1>
<p>Genoplesium littorale, commonly known as the coastal leek orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that resemble leeks, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
