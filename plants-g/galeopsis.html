<p>Galeopsis, commonly known as hedge mustard or lesser hedge mustard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically annual or biennial herbs with hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped. They produce small, yellowish or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and their seed pods are often inflated and split open when mature. Galeopsis species are often found in disturbed soils and can be common in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
