                    <h1>Goniophlebium plectolepis</h1>
<p>Goniophlebium plectolepis, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the Huperziaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds.</p>
<p>It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a simple, unbranched rhizome with small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Goniophlebium plectolepis make it an interesting subject for studies on fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
