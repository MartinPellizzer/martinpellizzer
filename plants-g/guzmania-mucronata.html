<p>Guzmania mucronata, commonly known as the spiked pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Guzmania mucronata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
