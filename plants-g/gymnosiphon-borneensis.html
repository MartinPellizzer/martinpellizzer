<p>Gymnosiphon borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean gymnosiphon, is a member of the family Podostomataceae, characterized by its unique adaptations to aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is a submerged, rootless plant that thrives in fast-flowing streams and rivers in Borneo. The plant's morphology includes a flattened, ribbon-like stem with small, scale-like leaves that reduce drag in flowing water. It plays a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
