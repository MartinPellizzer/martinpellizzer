                    <h1>Geoffroea vermifuga</h1>
<p>Geoffroea vermifuga, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in South America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's small, yellowish flowers are followed by orange berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Geoffroea vermifuga plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species.</p>
