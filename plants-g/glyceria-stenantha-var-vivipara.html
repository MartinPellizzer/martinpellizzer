                    <h1>Glyceria stenantha var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Glyceria stenantha var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous flatgrass, is a variant of the flatgrass species native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. One of its notable botanical features is its viviparous reproduction, where young plants develop on the mother plant before detaching and taking root.</p>
<p>This trait makes it an interesting subject for studies on plant propagation and adaptation.</p>
