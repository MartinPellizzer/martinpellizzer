                    <h1>Grammitis suprasculpta</h1>
<p>Grammitis suprasculpta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis suprasculpta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
