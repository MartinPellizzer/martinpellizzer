                    <h1>Glandularia tenuisecta</h1>
<p>Glandularia tenuisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, glandular-hairy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its glandular hairs on both leaves and flowers are thought to aid in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Glandularia tenuisecta is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
