                    <h1>Gomphandra camchayensis</h1>
<p>Gomphandra camchayensis, commonly known as the Camchay mountain fern, is a rare and lesser-known species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
