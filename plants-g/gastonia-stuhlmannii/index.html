<p>Gastonia stuhlmannii is a rare and fascinating plant native to the subtropical regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae, which includes many ornamental and ecologically important species. This plant is known for its striking, cone-like inflorescences that display a range of colors from white to deep red.
