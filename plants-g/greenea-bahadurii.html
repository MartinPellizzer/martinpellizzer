                    <h1>Greenea bahadurii</h1>
<p>Greenea bahadurii, commonly known as the Himalayan flax, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Greenea bahadurii is valued for its fibrous stalks, which have been traditionally used for making textiles and paper.</p>
