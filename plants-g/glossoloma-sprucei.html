                    <h1>Glossoloma sprucei</h1>
<p>Glossoloma sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent green leaves and unique, small, pale green flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing on tree trunks or branches in shaded environments. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Glossoloma sprucei is considered a conservation concern.</p>
