                    <h1>Geonoma parvifrons</h1>
<p>Geonoma parvifrons, commonly known as the small-leaved geonoma, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Geonoma parvifrons is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to adapt to indoor growing conditions.</p>
