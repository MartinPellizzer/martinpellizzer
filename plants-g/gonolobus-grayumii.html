<p>Gonolobus grayumii, commonly known as the grayumii dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to members of the genus Crotalaria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
