                    <h1>Gamelythrum denudatum</h1>
<p>Gamelythrum denudatum, commonly known as the naked stem lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically foliose and often appears as a thin, crust-like structure on rock surfaces. The plant lacks a distinct stem, hence its common name, and is primarily found in arid or semi-arid environments. Gamelythrum denudatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth patterns make it an important indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
