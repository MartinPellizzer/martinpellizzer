<p>Gagea dutoitii subvar. laevipes, commonly known as the smoothstemmed gagea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bulbs are an important part of its anatomy, serving as storage organs for nutrients and water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
