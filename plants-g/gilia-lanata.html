<p>Gilia lanata, commonly known as the hairy gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name "lanata," meaning "woolly" in Latin. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Gilia lanata is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
