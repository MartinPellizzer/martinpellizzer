                    <h1>Granatum punicum</h1>
<p>Granatum punicum, commonly known as pomegranate, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the region spanning from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces striking, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by the familiar, bright red, many-seeded fruits. The fruit's outer skin, or aril, is rich in antioxidants and has been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications for centuries.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to arid climates and its economic importance as both an ornamental and a fruit-bearing plant.</p>
