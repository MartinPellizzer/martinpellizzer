                    <h1>Glyptostrobus aquaticus</h1>
<p>Glyptostrobus aquaticus, commonly known as the water cedar, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. Its cones are small and typically contain a single seed, which is adapted for water dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Glyptostrobus aquaticus is considered critically endangered.</p>
