<p>Galeopsis frehii, commonly known as the Mexican horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Galeopsis frehii is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
