<p>Grammitis rutifolia, commonly known as the rusty-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, low-growing mats with finely divided, feather-like fronds. The leaves are usually dark green with a distinctive rust-colored margin, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
