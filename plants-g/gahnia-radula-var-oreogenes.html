                    <h1>Gahnia radula var. oreogenes</h1>
<p>Gahnia radula var. oreogenes, commonly known as the mountain flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous environments, often in alpine or subalpine zones. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
