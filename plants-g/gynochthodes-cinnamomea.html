<p>Gynochthodes cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant has a short, horizontal rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Gynochthodes cinnamomea thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
