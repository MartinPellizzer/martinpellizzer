                    <h1>Gymnogramma pozoi var. rutifolia</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma pozoi var. rutifolia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The varietal name *rutifolia* refers to its hairy, often reddish veins, which distinguish it from other varieties within the *Gymnogramma* genus.</p>
