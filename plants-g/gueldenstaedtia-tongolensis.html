<p>Gueldenstaedtia tongolensis, commonly known as the Tibetan vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and northern India, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers and has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. Its root system is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Gueldenstaedtia tongolensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
