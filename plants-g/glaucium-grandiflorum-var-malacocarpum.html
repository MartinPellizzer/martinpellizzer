                    <h1>Glaucium grandiflorum var. malacocarpum</h1>
<p>Glaucium grandiflorum var. malacocarpum, commonly known as the Persian poppy, is a flowering plant native to regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and a distinctive, hairy stem. The plant belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes other well-known species like the common poppy. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh environments.</p>
