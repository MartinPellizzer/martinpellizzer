                    <h1>Glaphyropteris</h1>
<p>Glaphyropteris, commonly known as the fern of the Carboniferous period, is a genus of extinct plants belonging to the order Psilotales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. Glaphyropteris fossils are often found in coal deposits, indicating its prevalence in ancient swampy environments. The plant lacked true roots and vascular tissues, relying on its rhizomes for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Its study provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants and the ecological conditions of the Paleozoic era.</p>
