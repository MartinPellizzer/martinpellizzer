                    <h1>Glycyrrhiza asperrima</h1>
<p>Glycyrrhiza asperrima, commonly known as the rough licorice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its root, which contains glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than other licorice species due to its harsh taste and specific growing requirements.</p>
