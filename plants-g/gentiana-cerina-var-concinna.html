                    <h1>Gentiana cerina var. concinna</h1>
<p>Gentiana cerina var. concinna, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched and somewhat woody.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to other gentian species.</p>
