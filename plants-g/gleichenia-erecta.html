<p>Gleichenia erecta, commonly known as the upright fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often arching fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive linear pattern.</p>
<p>Gleichenia erecta is notable for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to the structural complexity of its habitat.</p>
