<p>Goodyera matsumurana, commonly known as the Japanese orchid, is a small, epiphytic herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded forest environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it lacks true roots, relying on its aerial roots for attachment.</p>
<p>Goodyera matsumurana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
