                    <h1>Galanthus fosteri</h1>
<p>Galanthus fosteri, commonly known as Foster's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and two to three white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers have a subtle fragrance and are typically adorned with green markings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus fosteri is considered a conservation concern.</p>
