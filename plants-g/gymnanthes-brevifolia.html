<p>Gymnanthes brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved gymnanthes, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a distinctive aroma.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic compounds, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies for its unique chemical composition.</p>
