<p>Goniolimon glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, often submerged leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its reproductive strategy involves the production of tiny, capsule-like fruits that release minute seeds into the water.</p>
<p>Goniolimon glaberrimum is often found in nutrient-rich, shallow waters and is considered an indicator species for certain aquatic habitats.</p>
