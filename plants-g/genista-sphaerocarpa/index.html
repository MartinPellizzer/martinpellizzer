                            <h1>Genista Sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Spanish broom, scientifically known as Genista sphaerocarpa, is a hardy shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, yellow flower clusters and slender, thorny stems. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered an invasive species in many areas outside its native range. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a common weed in disturbed landscapes. However, it also plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for certain wildlife.</p>
