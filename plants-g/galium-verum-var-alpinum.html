                    <h1>Galium verum var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Galium verum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground, and its small, yellow flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Galium verum var. alpinum is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of these specialized habitats.</p>
