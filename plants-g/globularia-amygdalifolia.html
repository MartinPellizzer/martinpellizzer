                    <h1>Globularia amygdalifolia</h1>
<p>Globularia amygdalifolia, commonly known as the almond-leaved globularia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, pale green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in late spring, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
