<p>Grammitis pilipalaea, commonly known as the Hawaiian fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that forms dense mats, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis pilipalaea plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
