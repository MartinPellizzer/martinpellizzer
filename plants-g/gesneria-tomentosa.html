<p>Gesneria tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly gesneria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with a contrasting dark throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Gesneria tomentosa is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
