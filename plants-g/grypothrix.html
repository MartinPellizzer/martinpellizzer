                    <h1>Grypothrix</h1>
<p>Grypothrix, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Grypothrix thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
