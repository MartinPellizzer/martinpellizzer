<p>Grona heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf grona, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often heterophyllous leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Grona heterophylla is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
