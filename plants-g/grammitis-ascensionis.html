                    <h1>Grammitis ascensionis</h1>
<p>Grammitis ascensionis, commonly known as Ascension Island fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its small, clustered sporangia are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity.</p>
