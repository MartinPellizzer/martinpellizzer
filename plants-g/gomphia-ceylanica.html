<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and ecological studies.</p>
