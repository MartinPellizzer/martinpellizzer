                    <h1>Grammitis viridula</h1>
<p>Grammitis viridula, commonly known as green grammitis, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, moss-like growth, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
