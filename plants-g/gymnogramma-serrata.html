<p>Gymnogramma serrata, commonly known as the serrated rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma serrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
