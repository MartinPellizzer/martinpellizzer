<p>Geonoma cuneata subsp.</p>
<p>sodiroi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
