                    <h1>Glyphotaenium campbellii</h1>
<p>Glyphotaenium campbellii, commonly known as the Campbell's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Glyphotaenium campbellii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
