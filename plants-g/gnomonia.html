                    <h1>Gnomonia</h1>
<p>Gnomonia, commonly known as the gnomon fungus, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Gnomoniaceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are typically found on dead wood and are characterized by their cup-shaped or disc-like fruiting bodies. They play an important role in the decomposition of organic matter in forest ecosystems. The spore-producing structures, called pycnidia, are often embedded in the surface of the substrate.</p>
<p>Gnomonia species are not typically parasitic but are saprophytic, contributing to nutrient cycling in natural habitats.</p>
