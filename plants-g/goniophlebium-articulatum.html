<p>Goniophlebium articulatum, commonly known as the articulated liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and the presence of distinct, segmented stems that give it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil in temperate regions. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a thallus composed of a single layer of cells.</p>
<p>Goniophlebium articulatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
