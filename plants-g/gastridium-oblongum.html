                    <h1>Gastridium oblongum</h1>
<p>Gastridium oblongum, commonly known as the oblong ghostplant, is a small, aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Gastridium oblongum typically grows in still or slow-moving water, such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and specialized adaptations make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
