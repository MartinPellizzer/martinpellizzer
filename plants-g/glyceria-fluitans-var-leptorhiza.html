<p>Glyceria fluitans var. leptorhiza, commonly known as the slender floating grass, is a variant of the floating grass species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, narrow leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical spikelets that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow, still or slowly flowing freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and marshes.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and stable aquatic ecosystems.</p>
