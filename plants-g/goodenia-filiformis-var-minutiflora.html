<p>Goodenia filiformis var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered goodenia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
