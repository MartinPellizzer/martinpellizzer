                <h1>Gymnadenia friwaldskyana</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia friwaldskyana, commonly known as the Friwaldsky's grass-pink, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
