<p>Grammitis flabelliformis, commonly known as the fan-leaf moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually hidden among the foliage, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Grammitis flabelliformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting microfauna.</p>
