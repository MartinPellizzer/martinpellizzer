<p>Gagea antakiensis, commonly known as the Antakian bellflower, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gagea antakiensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
