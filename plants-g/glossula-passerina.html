                    <h1>Glossula passerina</h1>
<p>Glossula passerina, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of oak trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then spread its seeds. Glossula passerina is native to parts of Europe and is known for its unique ecological role in supporting bird populations.</p>
<p>Its presence on host trees can sometimes lead to reduced growth or even death of the host if the infestation is severe.</p>
