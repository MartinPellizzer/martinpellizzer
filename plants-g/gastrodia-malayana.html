                    <h1>Gastrodia malayana</h1>
<p>Gastrodia malayana, commonly known as the Malay orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown rhizome that is often used in traditional medicine. It flowers in clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are not showy but are important for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gastrodia malayana is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
