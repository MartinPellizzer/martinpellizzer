                    <h1>Griffithia gardneri</h1>
<p>Griffithia gardneri, commonly known as the Australian pine, is a species of conifer native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and distinctive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Griffithia gardneri thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense stands in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ecological impact, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
