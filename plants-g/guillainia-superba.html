                    <h1>Guillainia superba</h1>
<p>Guillainia superba, commonly known as the red swamp lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features bright red or orange flowers that bloom above the water's surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has long, narrow leaves that float on the water, while its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters. Guillainia superba thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its vibrant blooms make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems, though it is less commonly cultivated than other aquatic plants.</p>
