                    <h1>Geocarpon</h1>
<p>Geocarpon, commonly known as the ghost fungus or ghost mushroom, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Geoglossaceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their unique, irregular-shaped, and often pale-colored fruiting bodies that resemble small, ghostly shapes. Geocarpon species are typically found in forest soils, where they play a role in decomposing organic matter. They are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of various plants, particularly in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to their elusive appearance and habitat, they are often overlooked in ecological studies despite their ecological significance.</p>
