<p>Gentiana deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The genus Gentiana is known for its showy, often blue or violet flowers, and G. deltoidea is no exception.</p>
