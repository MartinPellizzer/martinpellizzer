<p>Gleichenia acutifolia, commonly known as the acute-leaved fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
