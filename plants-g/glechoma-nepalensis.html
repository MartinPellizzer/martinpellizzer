                    <h1>Glechoma nepalensis</h1>
<p>Glechoma nepalensis, commonly known as Himalayan ground ivy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, blue or purple flowers in early summer. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Glechoma nepalensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in local communities.</p>
