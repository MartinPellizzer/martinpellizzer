<p>Goniopteris crenatodentata, commonly known as the serrated-leaf water fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into serrated segments. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it in moist soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
