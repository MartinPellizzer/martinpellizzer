                    <h1>Gynochthodes badia</h1>
<p>Gynochthodes badia, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender, leafless stem and a single, showy red or pink flower. The plant exhibits a specialized symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Its habitat is typically restricted to humid, shaded forest environments, where it grows on tree roots or in the understory.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Gynochthodes badia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
