<p>Grammarthron biligulatum, commonly known as the silverleaf thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems covered in silvery-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, with a leathery texture that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Grammarthron biligulatum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
