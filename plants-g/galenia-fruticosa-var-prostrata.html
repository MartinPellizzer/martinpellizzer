                    <h1>Galenia fruticosa var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Galenia fruticosa var. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate galenia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Galenia fruticosa var. prostrata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
