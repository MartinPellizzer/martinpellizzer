<p>Galeottia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian galeottia, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean highlands of Peru and is characterized by its large, showy spatheal flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 3,000 and 4,500 meters. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture, while its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
