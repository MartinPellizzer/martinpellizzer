                <h1>Gothofreda suaveolens</h1>
<p>Gothofreda suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented ghostflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale lavender petals and a subtle, sweet fragrance that becomes more pronounced at night. The plant has small, elongated leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It blooms during the late spring and early summer, relying on nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Gothofreda suaveolens is considered an endangered species.</p>
