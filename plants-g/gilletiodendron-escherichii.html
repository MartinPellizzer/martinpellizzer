                    <h1>Gilletiodendron escherichii</h1>
<p>Gilletiodendron escherichii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
