                    <h1>Gagea durieui f. iberica</h1>
<p>Gagea durieui f. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian spring bulb, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small, bulbous plant that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring season. Its botanical characteristics include a short stem and a basal rosette of leaves, which help it survive in its harsh, arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
