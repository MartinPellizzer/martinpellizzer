                    <h1>Grammitis serriformis</h1>
<p>Grammitis serriformis, commonly known as the serrated hawksbeard, is a fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups known as sori. Grammitis serriformis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
