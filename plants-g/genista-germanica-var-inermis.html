                    <h1>Genista germanica var. inermis</h1>
<p>Genista germanica var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and trifoliate, with a leathery texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variety lacks the thorns found in other genista species, hence its common name.</p>
