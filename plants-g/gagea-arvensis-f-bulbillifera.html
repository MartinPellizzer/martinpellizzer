<p>Gagea arvensis f. bulbillifera, commonly known as the bulbil-bearing field scilla, is a botanical variant of the field scilla.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. One distinguishing characteristic is the presence of bulblets, which are small, vegetative propagules that form along the flower stems.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively, enhancing its survival in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
