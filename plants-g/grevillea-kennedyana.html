<p>Grevillea kennedyana, commonly known as the Kennedy's waratah, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, leathery foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, tubular flowers that are usually bright red or orange in color. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Grevillea kennedyana is well suited to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.</p>
