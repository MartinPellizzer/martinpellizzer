<p>Genoplesium trifidum, commonly known as the trifid spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the wet tropical regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, club-shaped column. The plant typically grows in dense undergrowth, often near the bases of trees or in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spider legs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
