<p>Griffitharia pallescens, commonly known as the pale willow, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, inconspicuous leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in catkin-like structures, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky or well-drained soils, reflecting its preference for harsh, elevated habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Griffitharia pallescens is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
