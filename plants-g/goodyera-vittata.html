                    <h1>Goodyera vittata</h1>
<p>Goodyera vittata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in the understory of forests. The plant has slender, fleshy roots and produces striking, pale green to white flowers with intricate patterns. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and lack a visible midrib, a characteristic feature of the genus Goodyera.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
