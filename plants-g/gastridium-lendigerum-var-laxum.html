<p>Gastridium lendigerum var. laxum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on its bladders for nutrient acquisition through predation.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its rapid growth and adaptability to a variety of aquatic environments.</p>
