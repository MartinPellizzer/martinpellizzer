<p>Gymnocalycium netrelianum, commonly known as the Nettle-leafed Cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant features white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium netrelianum is often cultivated as a decorative cactus due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
