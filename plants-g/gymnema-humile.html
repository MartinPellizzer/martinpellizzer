                    <h1>Gymnema humile</h1>
<p>Gymnema humile, commonly known as the Indian nettle or gymnema, is a climbing shrub native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is known for its unique ability to inhibit the perception of sweetness, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Gymnema humile is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Ayurvedic practices.</p>
