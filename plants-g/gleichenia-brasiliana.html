<p>Gleichenia brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian resurrection fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and linear, grass-like fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. This plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Gleichenia brasiliana is notable for its ability to survive desiccation and regenerate quickly when water becomes available.</p>
