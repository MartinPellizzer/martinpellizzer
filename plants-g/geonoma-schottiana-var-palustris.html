                    <h1>Geonoma schottiana var. palustris</h1>
<p>Geonoma schottiana var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
