                    <h1>Gordonia obtusa</h1>
<p>Gordonia obtusa, commonly known as the century plant, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slow growth rate and can live for over 200 years, though it does not flower until it is approximately 70 years old. The plant has a distinctive conical shape with thick, leathery foliage that provides dense shade. Its cones are small and clustered, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not related to the true century plant (Agave) and is more closely related to the cypress family.</p>
