                    <h1>Gossypium arboreum f. neglectum</h1>
<p>Gossypium arboreum f. neglectum, commonly known as the wild cotton plant, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, showy flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-coated fibers that are similar to those of cultivated cotton, though it is not widely used for commercial textile production. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed habitats and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its ecological and genetic value.</p>
