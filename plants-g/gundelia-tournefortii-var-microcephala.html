<p>Gundelia tournefortii var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf desert hibiscus, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
