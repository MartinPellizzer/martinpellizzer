<p>Gymnogramma ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, golden hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
