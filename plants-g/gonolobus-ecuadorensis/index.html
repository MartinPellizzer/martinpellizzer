                            <h1>Gonolobus Ecuadorensis</h1>
<p>Gonolobus ecuadorensis is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the legume family and is known for its striking violet-blue flowers. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found along riverbanks and in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a valuable subject for botanical study.</p>
