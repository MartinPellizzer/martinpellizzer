<p>Gossypium cinereum, commonly known as the gray cotton or desert cotton, is a species of shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and produces small, fluffy cotton-like fibers that are typically harvested for use in textiles. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it blooms during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Gossypium cinereum is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for sustainable fiber production in harsh environments.</p>
