                    <h1>Glechoma cataria</h1>
<p>Glechoma cataria, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a scalloped edge and produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with runners that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lawns and along garden paths.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves and rapid growth make it both a useful ground cover and a common weed in cultivated areas.</p>
