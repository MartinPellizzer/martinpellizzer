                    <h1>Gentiana faucipilosa var. caudata</h1>
<p>Gentiana faucipilosa var. caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The variety 'caudata' is distinguished by its elongated, tapering petals, which give it its common name.</p>
