                    <h1>Goniopteris macrotis</h1>
<p>Goniopteris macrotis, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a dense layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat.</p>
