                    <h1>Gothofreda montana</h1>
<p>Gothofreda montana, commonly known as the mountain ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, pale flowers that bloom during the brief summer months. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature and habitat specificity, Gothofreda montana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
