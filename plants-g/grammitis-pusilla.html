                    <h1>Grammitis pusilla</h1>
<p>Grammitis pusilla, commonly known as the minute huperborean fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thin, and often moss-like fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a finely divided structure, which helps in maximizing light absorption.</p>
<p>Grammitis pusilla is noted for its small size and is often found in tropical rainforests, where it plays a role in the complex ecological interactions of the canopy.</p>
