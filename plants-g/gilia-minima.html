<p>Gilia minima, commonly known as the small gilia, is a delicate annual herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gilia minima plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich blooms.</p>
