                    <h1>Gagea × haeckelii</h1>
<p>Gagea × haeckelii, commonly known as the hybrid squawroot, is a rare and intriguing plant resulting from the cross between Gagea lutea and Gagea montana.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats and thrives in well-drained, moist soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered bulbs underground.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and hybrid nature, Gagea × haeckelii is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
