<p>Geum rivale var. grandifolium, commonly known as water avens, is a flowering plant native to moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal leaves that are palmately lobed and its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows along streambanks and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained but consistently moist soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance.</p>
