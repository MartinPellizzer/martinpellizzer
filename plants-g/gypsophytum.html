<p>Gypsophytum, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Gypsophytum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
