                    <h1>Grammitis anjanaharibensis</h1>
<p>Grammitis anjanaharibensis, commonly known as the Madagascar fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in Madagascar.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected natural reserves.</p>
