<p>Gleichenia paulistana, commonly known as the Paulistana fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Gleichenia paulistana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
