<p>Gomphostemma chinense var. cauliflorum, commonly known as the Chinese climbing bignay, is a flowering plant native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody vine structure and is known for its unique cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers develop directly on the stems rather than the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while the fruit is a small, woody capsule containing several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in traditional medicine.</p>
