<p>Gymnopogon, commonly known as the naked grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their lack of auricles, which are the small ear-like structures found on many grass leaves. Gymnopogon species typically have slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. They are native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family.</p>
