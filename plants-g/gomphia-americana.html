<p>Gomphia americana, commonly known as the American gomphia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often mistaken for flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Gomphia americana is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
