<p>Glechon canescens, commonly known as the woolly glechoma, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight.</p>
<p>Glechon canescens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
