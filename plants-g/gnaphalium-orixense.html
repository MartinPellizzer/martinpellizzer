                    <h1>Gnaphalium orixense</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium orixense, commonly known as the Orixan frostweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, often in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow, silver-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium orixense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens for its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
