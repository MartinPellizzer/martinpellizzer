                            <h1>Godetia Decumbens</h1>
<p>Godetia decumbens is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and dry, open habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a touch of color to its arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping it conserve water in harsh conditions. Despite its modest appearance, Godetia decumbens plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
