                    <h1>Gagea lutea var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Gagea lutea var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is often found in montane and subalpine regions. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The narrow, linear leaves and early flowering make it distinct from other varieties within the Gagea genus.</p>
