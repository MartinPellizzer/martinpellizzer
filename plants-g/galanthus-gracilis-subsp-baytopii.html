<p>Galanthus gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>baytopii, commonly known as the Baytop's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to Turkey. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in woodland or rocky habitats, preferring cool, moist conditions. Its flowers have a single, prominent yellow spot at the base, distinguishing it from other snowdrop species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
