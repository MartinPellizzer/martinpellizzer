                    <h1>Glaucium tenue</h1>
<p>Glaucium tenue, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
