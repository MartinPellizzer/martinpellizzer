The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland floors and rock crevices, where it forms dense, compact clumps.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and early bloom, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders.</p>
