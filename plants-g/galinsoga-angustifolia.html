                    <h1>Galinsoga angustifolia</h1>
<p>Galinsoga angustifolia, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces numerous tiny yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. Its seeds are minute, dry, and wind-dispersed, contributing to its rapid spread in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Galinsoga angustifolia is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
