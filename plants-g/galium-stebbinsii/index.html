                            <h1>Galium Stebbinsii</h1>
<p>Galium stebbinsii, also known as Stebbins' bedstraw, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This species is characterized by its slender stems, small white flowers, and its ability to form dense mats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique and ecologically important plant.</p>
