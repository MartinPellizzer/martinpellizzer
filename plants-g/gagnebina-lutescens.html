                    <h1>Gagnebina lutescens</h1>
<p>Gagnebina lutescens, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow petals and sepals that form a star-like shape. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Gagnebina lutescens is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
