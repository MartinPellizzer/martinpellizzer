                    <h1>Grantia arachnoidea</h1>
<p>Grantia arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider's web coral, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Bryozoa.</p>
<p>It forms colonies that resemble intricate, lace-like structures, resembling a spider's web, hence its common name. The organism is characterized by its calcareous exoskeleton, which provides structural support to the colony. Each individual, or zooid, is microscopic and lives within a tiny chamber within the colony.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to reef formation and providing habitat for other small organisms.</p>
