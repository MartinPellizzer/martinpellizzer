                    <h1>Goniopteris</h1>
<p>Goniopteris, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>These fronds are typically large and have a unique, segmented structure that gives them a prehistoric appearance. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that create a dense, feather-like pattern. Goniopteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps.</p>
<p>Their prehistoric look has made them popular in paleobotanical studies and as ornamental plants.</p>
