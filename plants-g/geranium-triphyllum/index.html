                            <h1>Geranium Triphyllum</h1>
<p>Three-leaved geranium, scientifically known as Geranium triphyllum, is a unique and charming plant native to the southeastern United States. It is named for its distinctive three-leaf structure, which sets it apart from other geranium species. This low-growing herb thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its delicate pink or purple flowers bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its modest size and subtle appearance.</p>
