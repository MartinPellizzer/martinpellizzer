<p>Galium pumilum subsp.</p>
<p>papillosum, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. Small, white flowers are borne in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
