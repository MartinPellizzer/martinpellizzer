                    <h1>Geniostoma astylum</h1>
<p>Geniostoma astylum, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in damp, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer. Its flowers have a distinctive three-lobed lip and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Geniostoma astylum is an important component of wetland ecosystems and is protected in many regions due to habitat loss.</p>
