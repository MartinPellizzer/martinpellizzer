<p>Gastrodia tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin arrowroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a tuberous plant that produces a thick, fleshy underground stem, which is the primary part used for medicinal purposes. The plant is characterized by its short, upright stature and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It flowers with small, inconspicuous greenish-white blooms, which are typically followed by the development of its edible tuber.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
