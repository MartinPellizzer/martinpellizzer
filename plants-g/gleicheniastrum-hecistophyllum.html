                    <h1>Gleicheniastrum hecistophyllum</h1>
<p>Gleicheniastrum hecistophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperjiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are located at the ends of the branches. Gleicheniastrum hecistophyllum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
