<p>Guidonia laetioides, commonly known as the silverleaf guayacan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and silver-white undersides on its leaves, giving it a striking appearance. The plant has small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
