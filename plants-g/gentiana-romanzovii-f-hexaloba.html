                    <h1>Gentiana romanzovii f. hexaloba</h1>
<p>Gentiana romanzovii f. hexaloba, commonly known as the hexalobed gentian, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to the high-altitude regions of the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>This variant of Gentiana romanzovii is characterized by its unique hexalobed (six-lobed) corolla, which sets it apart from the typical five-lobed form of the species. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
