                    <h1>Gundelia cappadocica</h1>
<p>Gundelia cappadocica, commonly known as the Cappadocian weed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean, including parts of Turkey and Iran.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is often found growing along rocky slopes and in disturbed soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing these fragile ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its common occurrence, it is not widely cultivated for agricultural or ornamental purposes.</p>
