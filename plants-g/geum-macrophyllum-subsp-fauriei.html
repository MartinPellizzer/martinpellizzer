<p>Geum macrophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and tall, branched stems that bear clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of *Geum macrophyllum*.</p>
