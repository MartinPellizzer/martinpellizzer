<p>Geonoma negrensis, commonly known as the Negrense fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Geonoma negrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
