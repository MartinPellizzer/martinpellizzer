                    <h1>Grammitis coredrosora</h1>
<p>Grammitis coredrosora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that grow in a compact rosette. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss in its moist, tropical habitat.</p>
