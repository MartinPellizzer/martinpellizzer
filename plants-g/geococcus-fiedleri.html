                    <h1>Geococcus fiedleri</h1>
<p>Geococcus fiedleri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne on tall, erect stems. The plant has a short, thick root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures. Geococcus fiedleri is a perennial species that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
