                    <h1>Gonocarpus elatus</h1>
<p>Gonocarpus elatus, commonly known as the giant red mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, adapted for dispersal by water. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in shallow coastal waters and tolerate saline conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gonocarpus elatus plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
