<p>Gnaphalium monticola, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its colonization of rocky and alpine environments. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium monticola is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
