                    <h1>Grindelia stricta var. lanata</h1>
<p>Grindelia stricta var. lanata, commonly known as woolly desert gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
