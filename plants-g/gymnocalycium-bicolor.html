                    <h1>Gymnocalycium bicolor</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored moon cactus, is a succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, spiny stem that stores water, typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the growing season, adding a striking contrast to its green or blue-green stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium bicolor is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
