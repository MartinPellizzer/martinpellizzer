                    <h1>Gymnosporia stylosa var. rectispinosa</h1>
<p>Gymnosporia stylosa var. rectispinosa, commonly known as the straight-spined gymnosporia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the gymnosperm group. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and persistent, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
