                    <h1>Groenlandia densa</h1>
<p>Groenlandia densa, commonly known as the dense Greenland grass, is a hardy plant native to the Arctic regions of Greenland.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, harsh environments, showcasing adaptations such as a low-growing habit and thick, waxy leaves to minimize water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Groenlandia densa plays a crucial role in stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife.</p>
