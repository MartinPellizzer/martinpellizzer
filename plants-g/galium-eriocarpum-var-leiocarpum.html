<p>Galium eriocarpum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as smooth bladderworts, is a variant of the bladderwort genus characterized by its small, herbaceous growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture, distinguishing it from other varieties in the species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender, erect stems. Its root system is adapted for aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in wetlands and shallow water.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique ability to capture small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures.</p>
