<p>Gymnogramma prolifera, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Gymnogramma prolifera is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
