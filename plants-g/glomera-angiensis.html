<p>Glomera angiensis, commonly known as the Angiense Glomerate, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, clustered inflorescences of bright yellow flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of large trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Glomera angiensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
