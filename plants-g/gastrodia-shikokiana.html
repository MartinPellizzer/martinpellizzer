                    <h1>Gastrodia shikokiana</h1>
<p>Gastrodia shikokiana, commonly known as the Shikoku ginseng, is a rare and unique orchid-like plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and its lack of true leaves, relying instead on photosynthesis through its green, fleshy stems. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist forest environments, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually white or greenish in color, and it blooms once every few years.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gastrodia shikokiana is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native range.</p>
