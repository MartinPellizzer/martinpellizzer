                    <h1>Gypsophila tuberculosa</h1>
<p>Gypsophila tuberculosa, commonly known as the desert candytuft, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Gypsophila tuberculosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
