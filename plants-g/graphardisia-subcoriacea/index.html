                            <h1>Graphardisia Subcoriacea</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Graphardisia subcoriacea, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is renowned for its vibrant, coral-like flower clusters that bloom in spring, creating a dazzling display of red and pink hues. The tree's unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and public spaces. Despite its beauty, it requires specific care to thrive, including well-drained soil and adequate sunlight. Its name reflects both its visual appeal and its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
