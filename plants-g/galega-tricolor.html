                    <h1>Galega tricolor</h1>
<p>Galega tricolor, commonly known as the three-color vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its clusters of small, colorful flowers that range from white to pink and purple. The plant is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Galega tricolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
