                            <h1>Gilia Alpina</h1>
<p>Alpine gilia, scientifically known as Gilia alpina, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States and parts of South America. With its vibrant blue and purple blooms, it thrives in rocky, alpine environments where few plants can survive. This species is particularly adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions, showcasing remarkable resilience. Its delicate yet robust nature makes it a symbol of the rugged beauty of mountain ecosystems. Despite its hardiness, Alpine gilia remains a relatively rare and specialized plant, often found in remote and inaccessible areas.</p>
