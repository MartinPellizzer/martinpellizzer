<p>Gymnosporia filamentosa var. minor, commonly known as the slender sandbur, is a low-growing, herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant's reproductive structures are characterized by its distinctive, elongated bracts that encase the seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
