<p>Gagea gracilis, commonly known as the slender gagea, is a small, bulbous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh conditions, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Gagea gracilis is often found in association with other woodland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
