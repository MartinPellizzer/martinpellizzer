                    <h1>Gymnogramma palmata</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma palmata, commonly known as the palmate staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like fronds that are divided into a series of lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes form a dense, velvety covering that helps anchor it to its host and absorb moisture.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma palmata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
