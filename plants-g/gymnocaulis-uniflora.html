<p>Gymnocaulis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces a single, erect spore-bearing structure called a strobilus, which is typically located at the tip of the stem. Gymnocaulis uniflora thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
