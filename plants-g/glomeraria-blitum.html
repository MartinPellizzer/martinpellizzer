<p>Glomeraria blitum, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small, usually white or pale purple, and are arranged in a raceme.</p>
<p>Glomeraria blitum is a carnivorous plant, relying on its specialized structures to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-deficient environments.</p>
