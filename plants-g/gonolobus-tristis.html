<p>Gonolobus tristis, commonly known as the weeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, viscid substance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
