<p>Goniopteris paucipinnata, commonly known as the few-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four to six pairs of pinnules. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Goniopteris paucipinnata plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
