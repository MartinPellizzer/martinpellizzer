<p>Geonoma ecuadoriensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive, often serrated or lobed structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate light conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>
<p>Geonoma ecuadoriensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to the forest floor's organic matter and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
