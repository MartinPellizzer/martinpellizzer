<p>Glyceria permixta, commonly known as the mixed glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense stands, forming a mat-like structure that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. It is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate both saturated and periodically dry conditions.</p>
<p>Glyceria permixta plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
