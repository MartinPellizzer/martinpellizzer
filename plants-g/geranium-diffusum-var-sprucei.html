                    <h1>Geranium diffusum var. sprucei</h1>
<p>Geranium diffusum var. sprucei, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are typically oval to heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface and toothed margins.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
