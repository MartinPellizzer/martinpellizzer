                    <h1>Guzmania fastuosa</h1>
<p>Guzmania fastuosa, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting bracts that resemble flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its roots are primarily for anchoring rather than nutrient absorption, as it derives nutrients from decomposing organic matter.</p>
<p>Guzmania fastuosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, tropical appearance.</p>
