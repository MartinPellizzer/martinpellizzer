                    <h1>Gutierrezia resinosa</h1>
<p>Gutierrezia resinosa, commonly known as brittlebrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the aster family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and aromatic, resinous foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, glandular leaves produce a sticky resin, which contributes to its distinctive scent and provides some resistance to herbivores.</p>
<p>Gutierrezia resinosa is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
