<p>Glyceria leptorhiza subsp.</p>
<p>depauperata, commonly known as the slender glyceria, is a grass species native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. It has a limited number of flowering structures, which is reflected in its subspecies name "depauperata," meaning "poor in flowers.".</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in the eastern United States and is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
