                            <h1>Grammosolen Odgersii</h1>
<p>Sea holly, scientifically known as Grammosolen odgersii, is a striking coastal plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, silver-blue leaves and vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Thriving in salty, well-drained soils, it is often found along the edges of the ocean. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-resistant and ornamental plants. Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its sharp leaves and toxic properties.</p>
