<p>Grammitis garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's spikerush, is a member of the fern family, specifically the Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, spikelike clusters at the tips of the leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis garrettii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade.</p>
