<p>Grammitis organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices and along stream banks. Its spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis organensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
