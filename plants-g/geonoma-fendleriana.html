<p>Geonoma fendleriana, commonly known as the Fendler's fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats over time.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, round sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
