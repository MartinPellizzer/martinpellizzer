<p>Glossostemon bruguieri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Glossostemon bruguieri is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in dry landscapes.</p>
