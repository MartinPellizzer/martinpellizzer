<p>Graciemoriana gracieae, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a shimmering appearance. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often resembling miniature lilies. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
