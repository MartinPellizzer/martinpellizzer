<p>Glechon hoehneana, commonly known as the Hoehne's glechon, is a rare and striking member of the Aizoaceae family, native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
