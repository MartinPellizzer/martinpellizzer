<p>Grammitis dicranophylla, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
