<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its bulbs are adapted for storage of nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Gagea lutea plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores.</p>
