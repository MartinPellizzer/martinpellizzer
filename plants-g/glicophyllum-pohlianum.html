<p>Glicophyllum pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's ghostplant, is a rare and elusive member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its growth habit is low to the ground, with a rosette of leaves that help it conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its ecological significance.</p>
