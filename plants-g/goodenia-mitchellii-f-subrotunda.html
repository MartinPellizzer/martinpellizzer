                    <h1>Goodenia mitchellii f. subrotunda</h1>
<p>Goodenia mitchellii f. subrotunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goodenia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming from late autumn to early spring. The leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. This plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along creeklines.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
