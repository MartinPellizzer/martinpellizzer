                    <h1>Galarhoeus sieboldianus var. shikokianus</h1>
<p>Galarhoeus sieboldianus var. shikokianus, commonly known as the Shikoku holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy leaves that provide year-round visual interest. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters in suitable conditions. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is primarily based on subtle differences in leaf shape and growth habit compared to the typical form of Galarhoeus sieboldianus.</p>
