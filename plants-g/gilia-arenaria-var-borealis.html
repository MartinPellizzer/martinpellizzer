                    <h1>Gilia arenaria var. borealis</h1>
<p>Gilia arenaria var. borealis, commonly known as the northern sand gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, with five petals and a distinctive, narrow corolla. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its ecological importance to pollinators.</p>
