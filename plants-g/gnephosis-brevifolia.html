                    <h1>Gnephosis brevifolia</h1>
<p>Gnephosis brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic species belonging to the family Sphagnum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, velvety foliage. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in bogs and peatlands. Its leaves are short and broad, with a distinctively wrinkled surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Gnephosis brevifolia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
