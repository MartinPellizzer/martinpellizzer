                    <h1>Goniopteris subtetragona</h1>
<p>Goniopteris subtetragona, commonly known as the four-angled fern, is a fossil plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, four-angled fronds that are typically preserved as compressions in Paleozoic rock formations. The plant exhibits a complex vascular system, indicating advanced evolutionary adaptations for water transport and structural support. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that suggests a specialized growth habit.</p>
<p>Goniopteris subtetragona provides important insights into the morphology and ecology of early land plants during the Carboniferous period.</p>
