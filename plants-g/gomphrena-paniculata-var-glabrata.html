<p>Gomphrena paniculata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its clusters of pink or red, spiky flower heads that resemble small torches. The plant produces small, egg-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrata' variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, adding vibrant color to landscapes.</p>
