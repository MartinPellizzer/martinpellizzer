<p>Glechoma hederacea subsp.</p>
<p>hirsuta, commonly known as hairy ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its subspecies name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its creeping growth habit and ability to spread through stolons make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in gardens.</p>
