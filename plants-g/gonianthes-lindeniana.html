<p>Gonianthes lindeniana, commonly known as the Lindena's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a single, showy inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
