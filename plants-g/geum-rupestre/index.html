                            <h1>Geum Rupestre</h1>
<p>Rock avens, scientifically known as Geum rupestre, is a hardy perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments across North America and Eurasia. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing on cliffs, slopes, and dry meadows. With its distinctive yellow flowers and deeply lobed leaves, it adds a vibrant splash of color to mountainous landscapes. The plant is valued for its resilience and ability to colonize harsh environments, making it a symbol of tenacity in nature. Its ecological importance includes supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky areas.</p>
