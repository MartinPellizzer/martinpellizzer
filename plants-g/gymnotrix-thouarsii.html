<p>Gymnotrix thouarsii, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble small, delicate lanterns. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its botanical features include slender, wiry stems and lanceolate leaves with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
