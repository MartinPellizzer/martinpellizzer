                    <h1>Gothofreda guilleminiana</h1>
<p>Gothofreda guilleminiana, commonly known as the Guillemin's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, often appearing in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous leaves that help it survive in low-light conditions. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
