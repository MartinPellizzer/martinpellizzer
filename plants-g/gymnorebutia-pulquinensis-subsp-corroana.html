<p>Gymnorebutia pulquinensis subsp.</p>
<p>corroana, commonly known as the Corroana cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
