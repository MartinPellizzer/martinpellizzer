                    <h1>Gagea reticulata</h1>
<p>Gagea reticulata, commonly known as the netleaf gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its reticulate (net-like) pattern on the bulb surface, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Gagea reticulata is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows, where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>
