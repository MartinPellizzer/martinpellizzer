<p>Gymnogramma calomelanos var. martensii, commonly known as the Martens' shield fern, is a varietal form of the evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases on the undersides of its leaves, typical of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
