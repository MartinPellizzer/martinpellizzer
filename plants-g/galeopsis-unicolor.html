<p>Galeopsis unicolor, commonly known as the common galeopsis, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 centimeters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom from June to August. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, hairy capsules that split open to release the tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Galeopsis unicolor is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators.</p>
