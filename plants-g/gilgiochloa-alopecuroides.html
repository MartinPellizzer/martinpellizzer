<p>Gilgiochloa alopecuroides, commonly known as the coastal arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal restoration projects to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
