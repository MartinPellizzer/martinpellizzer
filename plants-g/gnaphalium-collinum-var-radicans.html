                    <h1>Gnaphalium collinum var. radicans</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium collinum var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white composite flowers that are typically clustered in dense, rounded heads. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic silvery appearance.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open, sunny habitats.</p>
