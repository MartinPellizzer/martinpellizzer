                    <h1>Gerardia pedicularia var. intercedens</h1>
<p>Gerardia pedicularia var. intercedens, commonly known as the common bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
