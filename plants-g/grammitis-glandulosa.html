                    <h1>Grammitis glandulosa</h1>
<p>Grammitis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in tiny, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
