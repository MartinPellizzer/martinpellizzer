<p>Geranium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are typically hairy, though the species name "glabrum" suggests a smooth texture, which may vary depending on the variety. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a rough, serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Geranium glabrum is often found in woodland edges, moist soils, and shaded areas, making it a valuable addition to native gardens.</p>
