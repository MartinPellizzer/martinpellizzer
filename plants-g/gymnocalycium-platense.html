<p>Gymnocalycium platense, commonly known as the Puna Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular or cylindrical stem that is often covered in spines and is adapted to survive in arid and high-altitude environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Gymnocalycium platense is a slow-growing plant that stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
