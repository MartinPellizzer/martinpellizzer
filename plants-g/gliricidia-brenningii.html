<p>Gliricidia brenningii, commonly known as the white gliricidia, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features bipinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Gliricidia brenningii is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its utility in agroforestry systems.</p>
