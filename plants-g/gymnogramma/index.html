                            <h1>Gymnogramma</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, known for its delicate and intricate foliage. These plants are commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Their small, lance-shaped leaves often form dense mats, making them popular in horticultural settings. Gymnogramma species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ease of care. Despite their beauty, they remain relatively underappreciated in the broader world of plant life.</p>
