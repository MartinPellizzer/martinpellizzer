                    <h1>Glyceria fluitans var. terrestris</h1>
<p>Glyceria fluitans var. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial glyceria, is a grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in regions with high humidity and seasonal flooding.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly seen than its aquatic counterpart, Glyceria fluitans, due to its preference for drier, terrestrial conditions.</p>
