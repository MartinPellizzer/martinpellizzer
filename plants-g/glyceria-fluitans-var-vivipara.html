                    <h1>Glyceria fluitans var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Glyceria fluitans var. vivipara, commonly known as water velvet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that grows in clusters, often forming mats on the water surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. One of its notable features is its ability to reproduce vegetatively through vivipary, where new shoots develop directly from the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to spread rapidly in suitable moist habitats.</p>
