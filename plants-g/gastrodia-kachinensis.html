                    <h1>Gastrodia kachinensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia kachinensis, commonly known as the Kachin arrowroot, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique underground tubers, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The plant is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it relies on fungi for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, shaded forest environments with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, its population has drastically declined, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
