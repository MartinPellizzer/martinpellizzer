<p>Gentiana antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic gentian, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in alpine and subantarctic environments, often growing in rocky soils and on mountain slopes. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Gentiana antarctica is notable for its ability to survive in extreme climates, making it a symbol of resilience in botanical studies.</p>
