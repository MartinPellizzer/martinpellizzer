                    <h1>Gesneria × egregia</h1>
<p>Gesneria × egregia, commonly known as the hybrid gesneria, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Gesneria obtusa and Gesneria rigida.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green leaves and produces striking orange-red flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Gesneria × egregia is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
