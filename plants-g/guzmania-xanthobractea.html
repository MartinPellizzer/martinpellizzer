                    <h1>Guzmania xanthobractea</h1>
<p>Guzmania xanthobractea, commonly known as the yellow bract guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays bright yellow bracts, which are modified leaves surrounding the flower. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes.</p>
