                    <h1>Guarea salgadensis</h1>
<p>Guarea salgadensis, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits that contain the seeds used to produce Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed trunk that helps it thrive in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>The plant plays a vital role in the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
