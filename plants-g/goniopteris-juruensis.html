<p>Goniopteris juruensis, commonly known as the Juru fern, is a species of tree fern native to the rainforests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a thick layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
