                    <h1>Graptophyllum gilliganii</h1>
<p>Graptophyllum gilliganii, commonly known as the Gilligan's ghostplant, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the order Coleochaetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its filamentous structure and the presence of specialized cells called pyrenoids, which are involved in carbon fixation. This species thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds with high light exposure. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are embedded within the thallus, facilitating sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Graptophyllum gilliganii plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its ancient lineage and evolutionary adaptations.</p>
