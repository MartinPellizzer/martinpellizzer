<p>Gomphia candollei, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and water-storing tissues.</p>
<p>Gomphia candollei plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
