                    <h1>Galedupa uliginosa</h1>
<p>Galedupa uliginosa, commonly known as the bog heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, and it produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is a key species for biodiversity in these habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland areas.</p>
