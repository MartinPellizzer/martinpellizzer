                            <h1>Galium Claytonii Subsp. Subbiflorum</h1>
<p>Clayton's bedstraw, scientifically known as Galium claytonii subsp. subbiflorum, is a rare and delicate plant native to the western United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors, where it forms low, sprawling mats. This subspecies is distinguished by its small, white flowers and hairy stems, which help it adapt to its often challenging habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and environmental protection.</p>
