<p>Gentiana borealis, commonly known as the northern gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, white down.</p>
<p>Gentiana borealis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its harsh, cold habitats.</p>
