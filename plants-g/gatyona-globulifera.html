The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its botanical features include opposite, lance-shaped leaves and a short, stout stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
