<p>Grias zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamor√≥n orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colorful flowers that often feature vivid red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree bark without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Grias zamorensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
