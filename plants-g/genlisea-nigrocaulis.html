                    <h1>Genlisea nigrocaulis</h1>
<p>Genlisea nigrocaulis, commonly known as the black-stem bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy or aquatic environments. Its stems are usually dark green to black, which helps in absorbing sunlight for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant relies on capturing tiny aquatic animals to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
