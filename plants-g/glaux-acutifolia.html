                    <h1>Glaux acutifolia</h1>
<p>Glaux acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-cress, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and damp meadows. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to that of watercress, making it a useful plant in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Glaux acutifolia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
