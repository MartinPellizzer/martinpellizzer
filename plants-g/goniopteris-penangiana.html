                    <h1>Goniopteris penangiana</h1>
<p>Goniopteris penangiana, commonly known as the Penang spleenwort, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or in shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Goniopteris penangiana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
