<p>Galium anglicum subsp.</p>
<p>divaricatum, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
