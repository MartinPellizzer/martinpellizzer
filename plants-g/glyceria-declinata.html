                    <h1>Glyceria declinata</h1>
<p>Glyceria declinata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Glyceria declinata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
