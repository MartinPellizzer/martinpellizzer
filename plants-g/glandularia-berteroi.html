                    <h1>Glandularia berteroi</h1>
<p>Glandularia berteroi, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance through its succulent stems and reduced leaf surface. Its glandular structures secrete oils that help deter herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Glandularia berteroi plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats.</p>
