<p>Gaultheria procumbens, commonly known as wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It produces small, dark red berries that are rich in methyl salicylate, a compound responsible for its distinctive mint-like aroma. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface and contain the same aromatic compounds found in its berries.</p>
<p>Gaultheria procumbens is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
