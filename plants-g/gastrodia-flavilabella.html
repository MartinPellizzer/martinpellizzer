                    <h1>Gastrodia flavilabella</h1>
<p>Gastrodia flavilabella, commonly known as the yellow-flowered gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and a unique, fleshy rhizome that resembles a brain, a feature common among orchids in the genus Gastrodia. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, and it relies on specific host trees for support. Gastrodia flavilabella is known for its limited distribution and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
