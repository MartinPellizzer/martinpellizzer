                    <h1>Grona retroflexa</h1>
<p>Grona retroflexa, commonly known as the backward-bent grass, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that curve backward, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, Grona retroflexa is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and wetland ecosystems.</p>
