                    <h1>Guzmania gloriosa</h1>
<p>Guzmania gloriosa, commonly known as the royal bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a crown, which is why it is often called the "crown of the forest.". The plant features a rosette of waxy, strap-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small aquatic environment for microorganisms and small animals. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, are short-lived but highly showy.</p>
<p>Guzmania gloriosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish.</p>
