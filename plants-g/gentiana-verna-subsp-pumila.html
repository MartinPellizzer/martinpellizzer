<p>Gentiana verna subsp.</p>
<p>pumila, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with a rosette of basal leaves and a single, striking blue or sky-blue flower.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully unfurl, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
