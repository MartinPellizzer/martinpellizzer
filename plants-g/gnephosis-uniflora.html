<p>Gnephosis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower ghostplant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring a single, elongated spore-producing organ at the base of each frond.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Gnephosis uniflora remains a subject of botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
