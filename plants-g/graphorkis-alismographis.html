<p>Graphorkis alismographis, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps it stay buoyant. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the early summer.</p>
<p>Graphorkis alismographis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
