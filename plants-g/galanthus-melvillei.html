                    <h1>Galanthus melvillei</h1>
<p>Galanthus melvillei, commonly known as Melville's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate species of the genus Galanthus.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers with a distinctive yellow spot at the base. It blooms in early spring, typically between September and November, depending on the region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus melvillei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
