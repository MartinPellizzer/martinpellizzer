                    <h1>Gajanus</h1>
<p>Gajanus, commonly known as the Indian lotus, is a sacred aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows in shallow water, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers that range in color from white to pink and deep red. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The botanical name *Nelumbo nucifera* reflects its significance in both cultural and ecological contexts.</p>
