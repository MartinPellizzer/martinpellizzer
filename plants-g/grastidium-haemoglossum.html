                    <h1>Grastidium haemoglossum</h1>
<p>Grastidium haemoglossum, commonly known as the crimson-tongued orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid red petals with a distinctive blue-veined pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Grastidium haemoglossum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
