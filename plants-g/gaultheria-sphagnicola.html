                    <h1>Gaultheria sphagnicola</h1>
<p>Gaultheria sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in acidic, moist environments such as bogs and heathlands, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but have a sharp, peppery flavor.</p>
<p>Gaultheria sphagnicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
