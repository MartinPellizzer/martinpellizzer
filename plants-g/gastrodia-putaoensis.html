                    <h1>Gastrodia putaoensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia putaoensis, commonly known as the Putao orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and somewhat tuberous structure. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its underground rhizome for photosynthesis through mycorrhizal associations. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, and it is highly valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Gastrodia putaoensis is considered critically endangered.</p>
