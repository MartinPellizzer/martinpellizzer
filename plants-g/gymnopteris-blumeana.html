<p>Gymnopteris blumeana, commonly known as the Blume's barren fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, spore-producing structures called sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of sporangia.</p>
<p>Gymnopteris blumeana plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
