<p>Gymnostichum patulum, commonly known as the slender spinifex, is a species of grass found primarily in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and high salinity.</p>
<p>Gymnostichum patulum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert fauna.</p>
