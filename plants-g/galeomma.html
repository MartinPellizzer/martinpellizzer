                    <h1>Galeomma</h1>
<p>Galeomma, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils. They are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. Galeomma species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or tree trunks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their adaptability to harsh environments and their role in ecological systems.</p>
