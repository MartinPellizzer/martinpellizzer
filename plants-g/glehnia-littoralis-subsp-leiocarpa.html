<p>Glehnia littoralis subsp.</p>
<p>leiocarpa, commonly known as the coastal glehnia, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
