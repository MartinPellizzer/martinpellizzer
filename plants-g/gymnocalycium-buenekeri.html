                    <h1>Gymnocalycium buenekeri</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium buenekeri, commonly known as the Buehnel's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium buenekeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
