<p>Glossocarya hemiderma, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and dispersed by wind.</p>
