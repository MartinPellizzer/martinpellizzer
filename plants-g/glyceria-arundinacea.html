                    <h1>Glyceria arundinacea</h1>
<p>Glyceria arundinacea, commonly known as rivergrass or sweet grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Glyceria arundinacea is adapted to moist environments and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
