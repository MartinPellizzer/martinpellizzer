                    <h1>Goniophlebium dasypleuron</h1>
<p>Goniophlebium dasypleuron, commonly known as the broad-pleated fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into broad, pleated segments, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
