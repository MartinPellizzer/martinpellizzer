                    <h1>Geranium humifusum</h1>
<p>Geranium humifusum, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems spread horizontally along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Geranium humifusum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
