                    <h1>Gladiolus rogersii var. graminifolius</h1>
<p>Gladiolus rogersii var. graminifolius, commonly known as the grass-leaved gladiolus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, giving it its common name, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
