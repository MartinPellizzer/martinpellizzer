<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense, terminal umbels, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal in natural habitats.</p>
