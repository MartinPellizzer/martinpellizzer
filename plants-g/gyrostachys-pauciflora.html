                    <h1>Gyrostachys pauciflora</h1>
<p>Gyrostachys pauciflora, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, enabling it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Gyrostachys pauciflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
