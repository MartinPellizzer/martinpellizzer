                    <h1>Galactia pretiosa var. trifoliolata</h1>
<p>Galactia pretiosa var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, heart-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
