<p>Galarhoeus lasiocaulus f. densifolius, commonly known as the dense-leaved haircap moss, is a variant of the haircap moss genus characterized by its dense, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Calypogeeae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features closely packed, cushion-like shoots with densely arranged, papery leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its leaves are usually shorter and broader compared to the typical species, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This moss plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
