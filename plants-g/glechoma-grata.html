                    <h1>Glechoma grata</h1>
<p>Glechoma grata, commonly known as pretty grass or ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation.</p>
<p>Glechoma grata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscapes.</p>
