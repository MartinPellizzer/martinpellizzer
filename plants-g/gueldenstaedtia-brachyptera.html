                    <h1>Gueldenstaedtia brachyptera</h1>
<p>Gueldenstaedtia brachyptera, commonly known as the short-winged vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment.</p>
