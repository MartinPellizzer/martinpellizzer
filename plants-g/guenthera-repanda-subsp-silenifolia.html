<p>Guenthera repanda subsp.</p>
<p>silenifolia, commonly known as the silversword, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with thick, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like trichomes.</p>
<p>The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique volcanic soils of Hawaii's high-elevation areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
