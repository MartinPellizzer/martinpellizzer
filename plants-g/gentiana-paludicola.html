                    <h1>Gentiana paludicola</h1>
<p>Gentiana paludicola, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or along the edges of marshes. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine downy layer.</p>
<p>Gentiana paludicola plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
