<p>Gymnopteris platyrhynchos, commonly known as the broad-ribbed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments with prominent, broad rachises. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology and habitat preferences make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
