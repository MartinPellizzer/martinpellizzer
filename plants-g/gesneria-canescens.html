<p>Gesneria canescens, commonly known as the woolly gesneria, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a unique and eye-catching appearance. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its velvety texture. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the summer months.</p>
<p>Gesneria canescens is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its relatively low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
