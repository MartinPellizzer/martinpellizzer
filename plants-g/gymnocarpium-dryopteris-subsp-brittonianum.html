<p>Gymnocarpium dryopteris subsp.</p>
<p>brittonianum, commonly known as the Britton's barren fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori without an indusium, a feature typical of the genus Gymnocarpium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced sporangial structures and is often found in the northeastern United States.</p>
