<p>Goodenia glauca var. subintegra, commonly known as the coastal goodenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with erect, sparsely hairy stems that often grow in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a glaucous (bluish) coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
