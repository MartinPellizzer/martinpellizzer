                    <h1>Gleichenia laevigata var. bracteata</h1>
<p>Gleichenia laevigata var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate cliff fern, is a variant of the common cliff fern found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its linear, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically found on rock surfaces or in crevices. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by the presence of bracts at the base of the sporangia clusters, contributing to its unique morphology.</p>
