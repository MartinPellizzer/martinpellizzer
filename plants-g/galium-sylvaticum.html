                    <h1>Galium sylvaticum</h1>
<p>Galium sylvaticum, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Galium sylvaticum is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in forest understories.</p>
