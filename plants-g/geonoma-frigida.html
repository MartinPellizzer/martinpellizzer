                    <h1>Geonoma frigida</h1>
<p>Geonoma frigida, commonly known as the cold fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery fronds that are adapted to cold and humid environments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in cloud forests. Its spores are released in abundance, contributing to its propagation in suitable microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Geonoma frigida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
