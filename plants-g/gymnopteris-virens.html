<p>Gymnopteris virens, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. Gymnopteris virens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its simple yet elegant structure makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
