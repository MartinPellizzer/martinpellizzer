                    <h1>Gaultheria latifolia</h1>
<p>Gaultheria latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and have a sharp, minty flavor. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gaultheria latifolia is also valued for its aromatic oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of wintergreen oil.</p>
