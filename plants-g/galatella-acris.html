<p>Galatella acris, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
