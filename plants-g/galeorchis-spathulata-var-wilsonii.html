<p>Galeorchis spathulata var. wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's broad-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with lanceolate to spatulate leaves that are often covered in a dense, white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
