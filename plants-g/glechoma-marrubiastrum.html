<p>Glechoma marrubiastrum, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat respiratory and digestive ailments.</p>
