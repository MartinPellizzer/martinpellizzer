                    <h1>Goodyera caudatilabella</h1>
<p>Goodyera caudatilabella, commonly known as the long-tailed maidenhair, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cascading stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces intricate, greenish-white flowers with distinctive spurred petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing epiphytically on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
