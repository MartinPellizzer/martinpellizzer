                    <h1>Gagea foliosa</h1>
<p>Gagea foliosa, commonly known as the leafy gagea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish-white flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival in arid conditions, allowing it to persist through dry periods.</p>
<p>Gagea foliosa is often found in rocky soils and is a characteristic component of chaparral and coastal sage scrub ecosystems.</p>
