                    <h1>Globimetula oreophila</h1>
<p>Globimetula oreophila, commonly known as the mountain globemetula, is a rare and specialized plant species found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it adapts to cold and nutrient-poor conditions. Its small, white flowers are clustered in spherical umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Globimetula oreophila is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in mountainous regions.</p>
