<p>Gymnopteris inconstans, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often variable in shape and size. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.
