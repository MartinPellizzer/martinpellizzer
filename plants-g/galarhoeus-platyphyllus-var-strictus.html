                    <h1>Galarhoeus platyphyllus var. strictus</h1>
<p>Galarhoeus platyphyllus var. strictus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed galarhoeus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pale blue and violet, which bloom during the short growing season in its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
