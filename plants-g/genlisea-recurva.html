                    <h1>Genlisea recurva</h1>
<p>Genlisea recurva, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly inflate to capture small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its stems for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Its unique trapping mechanism makes it an intriguing subject in the study of plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
