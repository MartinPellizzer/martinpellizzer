<p>Genlisea multiflora, commonly known as the bladderwound, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibacillaceae and is characterized by its unique, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems and roots are often found in the water.</p>
<p>Genlisea multiflora plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life.</p>
