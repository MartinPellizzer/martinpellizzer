                    <h1>Gnetum longispica</h1>
<p>Gnetum longispica, commonly known as the long-spined gnetum, is a unique gymnosperm native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, scale-like seeds that are enclosed in a fleshy, cup-like structure called an aril. Its vascular system includes a unique type of xylem with spiral tracheids, which is a distinguishing feature among gymnosperms.</p>
<p>Gnetum longispica is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and montane regions.</p>
