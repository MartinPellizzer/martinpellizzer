<p>Gonocormus teysmannii, commonly known as the Teyssmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in montane forests. It has small, clustered roots that anchor it to tree bark or moss-covered substrates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
