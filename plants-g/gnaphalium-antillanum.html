<p>Gnaphalium antillanum, commonly known as the Antillean cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, and it is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to release a fine, powdery substance from its stems.</p>
<p>This substance, composed of tiny, airborne seeds, aids in wind dispersal and contributes to its widespread distribution.</p>
