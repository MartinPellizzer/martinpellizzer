<p>Gentiana glacialis var. pumila, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its beauty and hardiness.</p>
