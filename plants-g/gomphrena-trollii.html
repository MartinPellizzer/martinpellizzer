                    <h1>Gomphrena trollii</h1>
<p>Gomphrena trollii, commonly known as the dwarf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy bracts that resemble small globes, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the center of these colorful bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Gomphrena trollii is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>
