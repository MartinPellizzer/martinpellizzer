                    <h1>Geniostoma rupestre var. glaberrimum</h1>
<p>Geniostoma rupestre var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem with a smooth, pale green surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
