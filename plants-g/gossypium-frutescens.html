<p>Gossypium frutescens, commonly known as the stellate cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and is known for its fibrous seed pods, which contain the cotton fibers. It is less commonly cultivated than other cotton species but is of interest for its ecological and genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Gossypium frutescens plays a role in the wild cotton gene pool and is studied for potential agricultural and textile applications.</p>
