                <h1>Glechoma curviflora</h1>
<p>Glechoma curviflora, commonly known as creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Glechoma curviflora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
