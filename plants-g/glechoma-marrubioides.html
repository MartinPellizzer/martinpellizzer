                    <h1>Glechoma marrubioides</h1>
<p>Glechoma marrubioides, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants, and is characterized by its spreading growth habit. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
