                    <h1>Geum heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Geum heterophyllum, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stem leaves are smaller and more elongated. The plant produces clusters of yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
