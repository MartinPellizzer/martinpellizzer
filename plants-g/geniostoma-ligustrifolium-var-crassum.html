                    <h1>Geniostoma ligustrifolium var. crassum</h1>
<p>Geniostoma ligustrifolium var. crassum, commonly known as the broad-leaved geniostoma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are broader than the typical variety, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in wet, clayey soils.</p>
