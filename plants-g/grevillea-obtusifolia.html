                    <h1>Grevillea obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Grevillea obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed waratah, is a striking shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, red or pink floral spikes that bloom in spring. The plant's leaves are broadly elliptical and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Grevillea obtusifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
