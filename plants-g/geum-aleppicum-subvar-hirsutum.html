                    <h1>Geum aleppicum subvar. hirsutum</h1>
<p>Geum aleppicum subvar. hirsutum, commonly known as the Hirsute Avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and prefers well-drained, rocky soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
<p>The hirsutum subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
