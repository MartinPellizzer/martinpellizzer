The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
