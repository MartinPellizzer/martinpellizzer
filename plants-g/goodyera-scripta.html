<p>Goodyera scripta, commonly known as the small-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, often on decaying wood or leaf litter. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Goodyera scripta is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
