                    <h1>Geranium pinnatifidum</h1>
<p>Geranium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially along the veins. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late winter to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance.</p>
