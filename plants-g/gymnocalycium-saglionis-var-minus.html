<p>Gymnocalycium saglionis var. minus, commonly known as the small-flowered saglion cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is typically green to blue-gray in color, covered in areoles with short, white bristles. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pale yellow to orange in color, blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
