                    <h1>Gagea foliosa var. genuina</h1>
<p>Gagea foliosa var. genuina, commonly known as the pink gagea, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and thrives in well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
