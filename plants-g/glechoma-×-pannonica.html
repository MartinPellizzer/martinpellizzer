                    <h1>Glechoma × pannonica</h1>
<p>Glechoma × pannonica, commonly known as the hybrid ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Glechoma × pannonica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread rapidly makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated areas.</p>
