                    <h1>Garuga mollis</h1>
<p>Garuga mollis, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by both humans and animals. Garuga mollis thrives in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce conditions.</p>
