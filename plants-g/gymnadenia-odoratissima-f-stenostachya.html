                    <h1>Gymnadenia odoratissima f. stenostachya</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia odoratissima f. stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sweet flag, is a rare and fragrant orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like fragrance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland environments. It is distinguished by its compact inflorescence and narrow leaves, which set it apart from other members of the Gymnadenia genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
