<p>Grastidium pleianthum, commonly known as the silverleaf starwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils.</p>
<p>Grastidium pleianthum is often found in rocky outcrops and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties.</p>
