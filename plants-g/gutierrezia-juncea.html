                    <h1>Gutierrezia juncea</h1>
<p>Gutierrezia juncea, commonly known as silverleaf greasewood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, dry environment. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Gutierrezia juncea is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems.</p>
