<p>Grammitis reinwardtioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moss fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming dense, carpet-like mats. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are arranged in a tight, compact rosette. Its fronds are usually dark green and lack true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
