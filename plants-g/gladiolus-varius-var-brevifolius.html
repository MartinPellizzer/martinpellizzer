                    <h1>Gladiolus varius var. brevifolius</h1>
<p>Gladiolus varius var. brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved gladiolus, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter than those of the standard gladiolus species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in late spring to early summer.</p>
