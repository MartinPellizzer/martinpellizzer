                    <h1>Gymnocalycium basiatrum</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium basiatrum, commonly known as the Baja desert cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, red fruits. Gymnocalycium basiatrum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a shallow root system and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
