<p>Goebelia, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have slender, often hairy stems and produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and rely on atmospheric moisture for nourishment.</p>
<p>Goebelia species are valued for their unique floral structures and are often cultivated in greenhouses due to their specific care requirements.</p>
