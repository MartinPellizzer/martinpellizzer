<p>Gymnocalycium oenanthemum subsp.</p>
<p>carminanthum, commonly known as the Crimson Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<p>This subspecies is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
