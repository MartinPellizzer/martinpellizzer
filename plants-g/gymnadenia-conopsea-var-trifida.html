                    <h1>Gymnadenia conopsea var. trifida</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia conopsea var. trifida, commonly known as the trifid bee balm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of fragrant, pink to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while the flowers are surrounded by a showy, hood-like structure known as the labellum.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its trifid (three-lobed) labellum, which gives it its specific epithet.</p>
