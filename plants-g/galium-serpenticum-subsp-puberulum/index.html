                            <h1>Galium Serpenticum Subsp. Puberulum</h1>
<p>Galium serpenticum subsp. puberulum is a lesser-known member of the Rubiaceae family, known for its delicate, creeping growth habit and soft, hairy foliage. Found primarily in moist, shaded environments across eastern North America, this subspecies thrives in forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its small white flowers bloom in clusters, adding a subtle beauty to the underbrush during late spring and early summer. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local insect populations and soil stability. Due to habitat loss, this plant is becoming increasingly rare, making conservation efforts all the more critical.</p>
