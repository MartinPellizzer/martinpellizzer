                    <h1>Gerascanthus millenii</h1>
<p>Gerascanthus millenii, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
