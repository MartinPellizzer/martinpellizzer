<p>Grammitis palauensis, commonly known as Palau fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Palau in the western Pacific Ocean and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis palauensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to forest floor biodiversity and providing microhabitats for small organisms.</p>
