                    <h1>Greenwayodendron littorale</h1>
<p>Greenwayodendron littorale, commonly known as the coastal greenwayodendron, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near the shoreline, adapted to sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
