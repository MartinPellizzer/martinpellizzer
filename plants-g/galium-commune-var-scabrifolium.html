                    <h1>Galium commune var. scabrifolium</h1>
<p>Galium commune var. scabrifolium, commonly known as roughleaf bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded environments. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a rough, sandpapery texture due to their dense pubescence. Small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its distinctive leaf structure and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and wetlands.</p>
