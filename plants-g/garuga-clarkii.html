<p>Garuga clarkii, commonly known as the Clark's garuga, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.

Garuga clarkii is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can endure prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
