                    <h1>Gonolobus suberifer</h1>
<p>Gonolobus suberifer, commonly known as the hairy go-on, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats.</p>
<p>The plant's hairy texture and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
