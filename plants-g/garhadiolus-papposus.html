<p>Garhadiolus papposus, commonly known as the hairy pappus grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a hairy pappus, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Garhadiolus papposus is often found in savannas and rocky areas, where it contributes to soil stability and provides habitat for small animals.</p>
