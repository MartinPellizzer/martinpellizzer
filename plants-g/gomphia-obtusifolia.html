<p>Gomphia obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved gomphia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments.</p>
