                            <h1>Gonzalea Dicocca</h1>
<p>Red trumpet vine, scientifically known as Gonzalea dicocca, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is prized for its vibrant, trumpet-shaped blooms that range from red to orange in color. This vine thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its rapid growth and showy flowers make it both a decorative and ecological asset. Despite its beauty, it requires careful management due to its aggressive spreading habit.</p>
