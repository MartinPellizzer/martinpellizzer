                    <h1>Galium viscosum var. bovei</h1>
<p>Galium viscosum var. bovei, commonly known as sticky false nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other species in the Rubiaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
