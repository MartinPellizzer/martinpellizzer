                    <h1>Gilibertia williamsii</h1>
<p>Gilibertia williamsii, commonly known as the yellow-flowered gilibertia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Gilibertia williamsii is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
