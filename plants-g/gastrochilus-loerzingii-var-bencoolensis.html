                    <h1>Gastrochilus loerzingii var. bencoolensis</h1>
<p>Gastrochilus loerzingii var. bencoolensis, commonly known as the Bencoolen gastrochilus, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
