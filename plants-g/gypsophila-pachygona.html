<p>Gypsophila pachygona, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help it survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Gypsophila pachygona is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens.</p>
