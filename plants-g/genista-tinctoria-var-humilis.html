<p>Genista tinctoria var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems covered in small, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover.</p>
