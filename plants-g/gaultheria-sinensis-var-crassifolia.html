                    <h1>Gaultheria sinensis var. crassifolia</h1>
<p>Gaultheria sinensis var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved wintergreen, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are broader than those of the typical G. sinensis. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible and have a peppery taste. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
