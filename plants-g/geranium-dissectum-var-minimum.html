                    <h1>Geranium dissectum var. minimum</h1>
<p>Geranium dissectum var. minimum, commonly known as the miniature cut-leaved geranium, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely dissected, lobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and extended blooming period.</p>
