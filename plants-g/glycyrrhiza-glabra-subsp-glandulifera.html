<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra subsp.</p>
<p>glandulifera, commonly known as the European licorice, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to the more widely cultivated Glycyrrhiza glabra, but it is less commonly used in commercial licorice production.</p>
