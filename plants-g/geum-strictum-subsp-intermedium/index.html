                            <h1>Geum Strictum Subsp. Intermedium</h1>
<p>Culver's root, scientifically known as Geum strictum subsp. intermedium, is a striking perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and wet meadows, where it forms dense colonies. Its common name derives from its historical use by early settlers who found it useful for medicinal purposes. Culver's root is not only a valuable addition to native plant gardens but also plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife.</p>
