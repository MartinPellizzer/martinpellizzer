                    <h1>Gutenbergia boranensis</h1>
<p>Gutenbergia boranensis, commonly known as the Boran ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the arid regions of Kenya.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers and unique, elongated petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in fragmented populations.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of ecological health in its native range.</p>
