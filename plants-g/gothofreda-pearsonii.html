                    <h1>Gothofreda pearsonii</h1>
<p>Gothofreda pearsonii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has slender, fleshy roots and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
