                    <h1>Gastonia sechellarum var. contracta</h1>
<p>Gastonia sechellarum var. contracta, commonly known as the Seychelles starling plant, is a rare and endemic species native to the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
