                    <h1>Gaga decurrens</h1>
<p>Gaga decurrens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Gaga decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
