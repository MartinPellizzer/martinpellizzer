                    <h1>Gynocardia</h1>
<p>Gynocardia, commonly known as the "false hellebore," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most notably Gynocardia scaposa, which is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and their clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Gynocardia species are typically herbaceous perennials that thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>They are not commonly cultivated due to their limited ornamental value and their potential toxicity.</p>
