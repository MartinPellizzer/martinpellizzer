<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited licorice, is a variant of the licorice plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more compact fruits compared to the standard Glycyrrhiza glabra. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the distinctive, sweet-smelling pods. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their high concentration of glycyrrhizin, which has anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued in herbal teas and as a flavoring agent in food and beverages.</p>
