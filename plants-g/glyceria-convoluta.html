                    <h1>Glyceria convoluta</h1>
<p>Glyceria convoluta, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Glyceria convoluta plays a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity.</p>
