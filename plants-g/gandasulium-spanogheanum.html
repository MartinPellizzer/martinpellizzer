                    <h1>Gandasulium spanogheanum</h1>
<p>Gandasulium spanogheanum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft glow during the night, a unique adaptation believed to aid in pollination. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the rich, decomposing leaf litter. Its reproductive cycle involves the production of spores, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
