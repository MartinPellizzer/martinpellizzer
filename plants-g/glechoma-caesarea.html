<p>Glechoma caesarea, commonly known as the purple dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds.</p>
<p>Glechoma caesarea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
