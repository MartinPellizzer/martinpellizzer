<p>Galium aparine subsp.</p>
<p>agreste, commonly known as cleavers, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems that cling to surfaces through small, hooked hairs.</p>

<p>Cleavers are commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in moist meadows, where they spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
