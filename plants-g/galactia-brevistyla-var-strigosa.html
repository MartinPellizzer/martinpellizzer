                    <h1>Galactia brevistyla var. strigosa</h1>
<p>Galactia brevistyla var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy galactia, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
