<p>Gymnopogon glaber, commonly known as the nakedgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands.</p>
<p>Gymnopogon glaber is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
