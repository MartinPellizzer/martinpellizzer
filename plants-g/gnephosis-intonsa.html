                    <h1>Gnephosis intonsa</h1>
<p>Gnephosis intonsa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a single, slender stem with no leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption. It is an epiphytic orchid, growing on the trunks of trees rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Gnephosis intonsa is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
