                    <h1>Geonoma acaulis</h1>
<p>Geonoma acaulis, commonly known as the stemless bracken fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and the absence of a visible stem, with leaves arising directly from the rootstock. The fronds are typically dark green, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
