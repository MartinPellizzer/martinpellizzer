<p>Gymnadenia nigra subsp.</p>
<p>delphineae, commonly known as the Delphinean grasspinks, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-brown seed pods that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
