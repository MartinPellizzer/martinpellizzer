                    <h1>Grammitis graminifolia</h1>
<p>Grammitis graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like fronds that are often arranged in a rosette. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments.</p>
<p>Grammitis graminifolia is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in low-light conditions.</p>
