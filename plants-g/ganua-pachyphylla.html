                    <h1>Ganua pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Ganua pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved ganua, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ganua pachyphylla is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
