                    <h1>Galium aparine var. aparinella</h1>
<p>Galium aparine var. aparinella, commonly known as sticky willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems covered in fine, hooked hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin, while the small white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along pathways.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widespread Galium aparine.</p>
