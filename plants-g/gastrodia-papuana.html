                    <h1>Gastrodia papuana</h1>
<p>Gastrodia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan thunderstorm orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces a single, fleshy, club-shaped tuber that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in its harsh, mountainous habitat. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and are pollinated by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Gastrodia papuana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
