                    <h1>Gumira villosa</h1>
<p>Gumira villosa, commonly known as the hairy gumira, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a slender, erect stem covered in soft, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Gumira villosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
