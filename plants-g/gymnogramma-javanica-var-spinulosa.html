                    <h1>Gymnogramma javanica var. spinulosa</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma javanica var. spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Gymnogramma.</p>
<p>It is a delicate, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia, including regions like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, contributing to its ornamental value. Its rhizomes are typically creeping and help in anchoring the plant in wet soil or aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
