                            <h1>Gnaphalium Striatum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium striatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf everlasting, is a hardy perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and prairies. Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it a resilient and adaptable species. Despite its delicate appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
