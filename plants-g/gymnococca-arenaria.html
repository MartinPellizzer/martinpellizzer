                    <h1>Gymnococca arenaria</h1>
<p>Gymnococca arenaria, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has a dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, reducing water loss. It produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically borne on short stalks.</p>
<p>Gymnococca arenaria is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats.</p>
