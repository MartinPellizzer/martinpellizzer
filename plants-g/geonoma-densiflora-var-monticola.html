<p>Geonoma densiflora var. monticola, commonly known as the dense-leaved mountain geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping foliage that forms a rosette, often creating a small water-holding structure at its center. Its leaves are typically narrow and dark green, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in rocky crevices.</p>
