<p>Gastrodia cajanoae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian arrowroot, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tuberous underground stems, which are rich in starch and used in traditional medicine. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow color and a strong, spicy aroma. It thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, typically at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
