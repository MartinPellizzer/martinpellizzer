<p>Gastrochilus dalzellianus, commonly known as the Dalzell's arrowroot, is a rare and distinctive orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
