                    <h1>Gonolobus surinamensis</h1>
<p>Gonolobus surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam dodder, is a flowering plant in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic species that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
