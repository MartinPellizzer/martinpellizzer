                    <h1>Gutierrezia ledifolia</h1>
<p>Gutierrezia ledifolia, commonly known as silverleaf gorse, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are silvery-gray, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gutierrezia ledifolia is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats.</p>
