                <h1>Guenthera nivalis</h1>
<p>Guenthera nivalis, commonly known as the snow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it can withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Guenthera nivalis plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores.</p>
