                    <h1>Gussonea chiloschistae</h1>
<p>Gussonea chiloschistae, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Xanthopsoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together form a composite organism. This lichen is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. Its structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
