<p>Gyrosorium samarense, commonly known as the Samarensis liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, thalloid structure with a dorsiventral differentiation, typical of many liverworts. The plant exhibits a rosette-like growth form, with leaves arranged in a tight spiral around the stem. It is found in moist, shaded environments, often on rocks or decaying wood in tropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
