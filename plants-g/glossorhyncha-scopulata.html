                    <h1>Glossorhyncha scopulata</h1>
<p>Glossorhyncha scopulata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Glossorhyncha scopulata is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
