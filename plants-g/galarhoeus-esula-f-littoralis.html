<p>Galarhoeus esula f. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal marsh horsetail, is a variant of the horsetail plant adapted to wet, saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, spore-producing cones. The plant thrives in coastal areas where it helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its presence is often indicative of brackish or freshwater marsh habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
