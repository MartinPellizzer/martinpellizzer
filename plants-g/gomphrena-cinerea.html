                    <h1>Gomphrena cinerea</h1>
<p>Gomphrena cinerea, commonly known as the frost flower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its striking, spiky inflorescences that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall, often persisting through the winter in mild climates. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gomphrena cinerea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
