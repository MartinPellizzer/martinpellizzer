<p>Goniopteris toganetra, commonly known as the Toganetra spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as on the trunks of trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Goniopteris toganetra plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to forest floor biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various organisms.</p>
