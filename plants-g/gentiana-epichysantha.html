                    <h1>Gentiana epichysantha</h1>
<p>Gentiana epichysantha, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It produces vibrant blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 8,000 feet.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
