                    <h1>Guzmania ventricosa</h1>
<p>Guzmania ventricosa, commonly known as the bottle palm or pineapple plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's roots. Its vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescence features colorful bracts that can range from red to orange, attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Guzmania ventricosa is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
