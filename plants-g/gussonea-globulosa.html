                    <h1>Gussonea globulosa</h1>
<p>Gussonea globulosa, commonly known as the globular cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its succulent leaves are adapted for storing water, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Gussonea globulosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
