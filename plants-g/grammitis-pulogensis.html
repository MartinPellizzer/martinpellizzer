<p>Grammitis pulogensis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus.</p>
<p>Grammitis pulogensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
