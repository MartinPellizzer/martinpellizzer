                    <h1>Ghinia alpina</h1>
<p>Ghinia alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, often in shades of blue or violet. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Ghinia alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
