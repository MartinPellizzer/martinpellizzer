<p>Genoplesium superbum, commonly known as the golden lily or the fairy lantern, is a striking orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow flowers, which are clustered in a showy, lantern-like inflorescence. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, typically from October to December, and are pollinated by native bees and other insects.</p>
<p>Genoplesium superbum is a rare and protected species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
