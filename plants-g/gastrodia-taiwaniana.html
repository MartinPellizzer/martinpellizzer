                    <h1>Gastrodia taiwaniana</h1>
<p>Gastrodia taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan ginseng, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, tuberous structure that is highly valued in traditional medicine. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, typically at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
