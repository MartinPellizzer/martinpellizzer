<p>Guzmania hollinensis, commonly known as the pink-flowered bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that typically features pink or red bracts. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves collect water, creating a small pool that supports a microhabitat for various aquatic organisms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Guzmania hollinensis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
