<p>Glossonema boveanum subsp.</p>
<p>nubicum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, cloud-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests where misty conditions are common. Its spores are released in abundance, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
