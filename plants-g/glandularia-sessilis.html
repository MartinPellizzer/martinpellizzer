<p>Glandularia sessilis, commonly known as the glandular verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in glandular hairs, which secrete oils and help deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
