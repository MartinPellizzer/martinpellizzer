<p>Galium ericoides var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, hairy stems that form dense mats, often found in moist, acidic soils of woodlands and streambanks. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating, and it has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Rubiaceae family, sharing similar ecological preferences and floral structures.</p>
