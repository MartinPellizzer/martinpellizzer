The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
