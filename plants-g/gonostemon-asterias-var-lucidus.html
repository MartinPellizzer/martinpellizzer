                    <h1>Gonostemon asterias var. lucidus</h1>
<p>Gonostemon asterias var. lucidus, commonly known as the glossy asterias, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy, glossy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
