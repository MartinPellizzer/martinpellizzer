<p>Galeandra angornensis, commonly known as the Angorn's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galeandra angornensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
