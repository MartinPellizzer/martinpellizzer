                    <h1>Glyceria spicata</h1>
<p>Glyceria spicata, commonly known as spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
<p>Glyceria spicata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
