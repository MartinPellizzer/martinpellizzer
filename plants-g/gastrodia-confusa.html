                    <h1>Gastrodia confusa</h1>
<p>Gastrodia confusa, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, yellowish-brown rhizome that is often harvested for medicinal purposes. It blooms with small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Gastrodia confusa is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
