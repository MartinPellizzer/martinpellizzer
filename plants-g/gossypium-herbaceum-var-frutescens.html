<p>Gossypium herbaceum var. frutescens, commonly known as wild cotton, is a shrub-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like bolls that enclose the seeds, which are typically small and hard. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its fibrous structure, it has been historically used for textile purposes, though it is less cultivated than other cotton varieties.</p>
