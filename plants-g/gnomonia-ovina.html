                    <h1>Gnomonia ovina</h1>
<p>Gnomonia ovina, commonly known as the woolly gnomon, is a member of the Rhytidhysteronaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, leafless plant that forms dense, cushion-like structures, typically found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant produces tiny, cup-shaped fruiting bodies that release spores, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are scale-like and tightly packed, reducing water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Gnomonia ovina is often used in ecological studies to assess environmental conditions in high-altitude regions.</p>
