The leaves are lanceolate to ovate, with a distinct willow-like appearance, and are usually hairy on both surfaces. Small white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
