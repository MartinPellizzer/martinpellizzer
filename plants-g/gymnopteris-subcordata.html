<p>Gymnopteris subcordata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that are typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive sori arrangement, with the sori positioned along the margins of the fronds. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, which help anchor it to damp soil or rocky substrates.</p>
