                    <h1>Georgina crocata</h1>
<p>Georgina crocata, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has a robust, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, which are attracted to its nectar.</p>
<p>Georgina crocata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
