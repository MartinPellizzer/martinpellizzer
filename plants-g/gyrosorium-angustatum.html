                    <h1>Gyrosorium angustatum</h1>
<p>Gyrosorium angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygenation.</p>
<p>Gyrosorium angustatum is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the margins of streams.</p>
