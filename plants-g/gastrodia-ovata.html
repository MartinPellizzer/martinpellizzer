                    <h1>Gastrodia ovata</h1>
<p>Gastrodia ovata, commonly known as the Chinese club-moss or the thunder god's orchid, is a unique orchid species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, club-shaped rhizome and lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground structures for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Gastrodia ovata is often cultivated for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Its growth is slow and it requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
