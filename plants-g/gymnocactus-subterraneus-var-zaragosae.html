                    <h1>Gymnocactus subterraneus var. zaragosae</h1>
<p>Gymnocactus subterraneus var. zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Spain.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
