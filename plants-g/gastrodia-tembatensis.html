                    <h1>Gastrodia tembatensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia tembatensis, commonly known as the Tembat orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrition. The plant produces unique, fleshy, red-brown pseudobulbs that store nutrients and water. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive, often fragrant appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Gastrodia tembatensis is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
