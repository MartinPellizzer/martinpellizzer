                    <h1>Gahnia microstachya var. fitzgeraldii</h1>
<p>Gahnia microstachya var. fitzgeraldii, commonly known as the Fitzgerald's spikegrass, is a variant of the common gahnia species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in the eastern regions of Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
