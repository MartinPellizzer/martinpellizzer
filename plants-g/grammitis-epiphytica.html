                    <h1>Grammitis epiphytica</h1>
<p>Grammitis epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis epiphytica plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
