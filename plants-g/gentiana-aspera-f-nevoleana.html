                    <h1>Gentiana aspera f. nevoleana</h1>
<p>Gentiana aspera f. nevoleana, commonly known as the Nevolean gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its lance-shaped, hairy leaves that help it withstand cold and arid conditions. This subspecies is typically found in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
