                    <h1>Globifera</h1>
<p>Globifera, commonly known as the globular fern, is a unique plant characterized by its spherical or globular growth form.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a dense cluster of small, delicate fronds that radiate outward from a central stem. Its structure resembles a ball, which helps it retain moisture and protect itself from harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Globifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>
