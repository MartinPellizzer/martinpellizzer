                    <h1>Gabunia letestui</h1>
<p>Gabunia letestui, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, woody fruits. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is not as widely studied as other sandalwood species.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Gabunia letestui is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
