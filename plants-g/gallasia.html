                    <h1>Gallasia</h1>
<p>Gallasia, commonly known as the Gallasia tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to certain regions of Africa and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters. Gallasia species are often found in savanna and woodland habitats, adapting to seasonal changes in rainfall.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and potential for use in traditional medicine.</p>
