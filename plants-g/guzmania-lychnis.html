<p>Guzmania lychnis, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, red-orange inflorescence that resembles a flame, which is actually a modified leaf called a spadix. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and the plant thrives in bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Guzmania lychnis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
