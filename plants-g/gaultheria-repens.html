                    <h1>Gaultheria repens</h1>
<p>Gaultheria repens, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and birds. Gaultheria repens thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves contain methyl salicylate, which gives it a distinctive wintergreen scent and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
