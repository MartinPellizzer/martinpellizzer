                    <h1>Gaultheria procumbens f. accrescens</h1>
<p>Gaultheria procumbens f. accrescens, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and shiny on top, with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, juicy berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its leaves contain methyl salicylate, giving them a distinctive wintergreen scent and making them useful in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by its more compact growth and broader leaves compared to the typical form of the species.</p>
