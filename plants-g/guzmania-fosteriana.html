<p>Guzmania fosteriana, commonly known as the Foster's torch, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a torch, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant features a central rosette of sword-shaped leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life. Its roots are mostly adventitious, growing from the base of the leaves, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity.</p>
<p>Guzmania fosteriana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
