<p>Gentiana alticola, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Gentiana alticola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
