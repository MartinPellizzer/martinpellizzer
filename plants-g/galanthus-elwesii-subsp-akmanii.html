<p>Galanthus elwesii subsp.</p>
<p>akmanii, commonly known as the Akmanii snowdrop, is a rare and delicate member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white, bell-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
