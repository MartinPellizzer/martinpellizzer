<p>Gurltia rigida, commonly known as the rigid gurlt, is a unique plant species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract specific pollinators. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Gurltia rigida is adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
