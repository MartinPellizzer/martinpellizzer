<p>Glandularia polyantha, commonly known as the stickyweed or glandular bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores and reducing water loss. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in the same glandular hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Glandularia polyantha is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
