                    <h1>Grammitis taeniophylla</h1>
<p>Grammitis taeniophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperbole, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperjaniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium.</p>
<p>Grammitis taeniophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
