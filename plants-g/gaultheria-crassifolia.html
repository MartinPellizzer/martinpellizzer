                    <h1>Gaultheria crassifolia</h1>
<p>Gaultheria crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, and its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Gaultheria crassifolia thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves contain methyl salicylate, which gives it a distinctive wintergreen scent.</p>
