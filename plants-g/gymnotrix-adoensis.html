<p>Gymnotrix adoensis, commonly known as the Adoensis ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that bears small, pale green flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gymnotrix adoensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
