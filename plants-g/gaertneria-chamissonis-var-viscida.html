                    <h1>Gaertneria chamissonis var. viscida</h1>
<p>Gaertneria chamissonis var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its fibrous roots and woody stems contribute to its resilience in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique botanical features.</p>
