                    <h1>Gaultheria solitaria</h1>
<p>Gaultheria solitaria, commonly known as the single-flowered wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves contain methyl salicylate, a compound responsible for its characteristic wintergreen scent.</p>
<p>Gaultheria solitaria is often found in acidic, moist soils in woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
