                    <h1>Grastidium gjellerupii</h1>
<p>Grastidium gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's ghostplant, is a rare and elusive moss species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in extremely cold, moist environments, often found on rocky substrates or in peat bogs. The plant has a delicate, creeping growth habit with slender stems and small, translucent leaves. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, consisting of sporophytes that are typically hidden beneath the leafy shoots.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Grastidium gjellerupii is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change.</p>
