                    <h1>Geranium arenarium</h1>
<p>Geranium arenarium, commonly known as the sand geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, blue-green leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Geranium arenarium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
