<p>Gomphandra obscurinervis, commonly known as the dark-veined gomphandra, is a rare and specialized member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with prominent, dark-colored veins that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with two to four petals, and are usually white or pale green in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
