<p>Galium eriocarpum, commonly known as the downy wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, sprawling stems covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a trifoliate structure, typical of the Rubiaceae family.
