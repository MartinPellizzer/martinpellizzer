<p>Gratiola viscidula subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its submerged, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to substrates with its root system.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its stems are often branched and covered in a sticky substance. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in nutrient-rich, oxygenated environments.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and serving as a food source for various invertebrates.</p>
