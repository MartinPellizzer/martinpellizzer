                    <h1>Geocaryum pindicola</h1>
<p>Geocaryum pindicola, commonly known as the Mediterranean dwarf lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a crustose lichen that forms a dense, tightly adherent growth on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. It is often found on limestone and other calcareous substrates, contributing to soil formation and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Mediterranean ecosystems.</p>
