                    <h1>Gentianella montana var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Gentianella montana var. stolonifera, commonly known as the mountain gentian, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its alpine habitat.</p>
