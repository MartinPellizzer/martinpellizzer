                    <h1>Glechoma tuberosa</h1>
<p>Glechoma tuberosa, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Glechoma tuberosa is also known for its aromatic leaves, which contain essential oils and have been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
