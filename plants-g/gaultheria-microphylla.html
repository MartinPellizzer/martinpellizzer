<p>Gaultheria microphylla, commonly known as the wintergreen shrub, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>

The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a spicy, minty flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate.</p>
