<p>Goniophlebium ramosum, commonly known as the clustered fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome, often forming dense clusters in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant's leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, narrow pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in ponds, ditches, and along the margins of streams.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
