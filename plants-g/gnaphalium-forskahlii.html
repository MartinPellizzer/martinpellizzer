<p>Gnaphalium forskahlii, commonly known as the Kashmir chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in northern India and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with numerous small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium forskahlii is also noted for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
