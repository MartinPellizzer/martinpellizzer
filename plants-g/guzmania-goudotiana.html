                    <h1>Guzmania goudotiana</h1>
<p>Guzmania goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range from red to orange in color. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Its roots are primarily used for anchoring rather than nutrient absorption, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf axils.</p>
<p>Guzmania goudotiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish.</p>
