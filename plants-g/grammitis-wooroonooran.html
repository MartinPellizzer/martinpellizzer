<p>Grammitis wooroonooran, commonly known as the Wooroonooran fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in dense, shaded environments, often in rainforests or under dense canopy cover. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis wooroonooran plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
