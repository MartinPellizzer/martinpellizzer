                    <h1>Goodyera × dominyi</h1>
<p>Goodyera × dominyi, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Goodyera uniflora and Goodyera schlechtendalii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white with a contrasting lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Goodyera × dominyi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
