<p>Globimetula dinklagei subsp.</p>
<p>assiana, commonly known as the Assian globeflower, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive globular inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, tubular flowers clustered closely together.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are usually basal and clustered, with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
