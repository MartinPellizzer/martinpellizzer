<p>Gymnocarpium dryopteris, commonly known as the narrowleaf barren-ground fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Gymnocarpium dryopteris thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitat.</p>
