                    <h1>Gastrodia leucopetala</h1>
<p>Gastrodia leucopetala, commonly known as the white-stemmed thunder god, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its symbiotic relationship with fungi for nutrients. The plant produces unique, fleshy, club-like structures called pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It flowers in late spring with pale yellow to white, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators like bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
