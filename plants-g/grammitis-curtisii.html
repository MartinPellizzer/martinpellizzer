                <h1>Grammitis curtisii</h1>
<p>Grammitis curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's spikemoss, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and creeping rhizomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among many mosses and ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grammitis curtisii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
