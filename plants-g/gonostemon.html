                    <h1>Gonostemon</h1>
<p>Gonostemon, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most notably Gonostemon corymbosus, which is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Gonostemon species are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
