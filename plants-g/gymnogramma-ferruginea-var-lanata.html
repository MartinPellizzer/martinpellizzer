                    <h1>Gymnogramma ferruginea var. lanata</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma ferruginea var. lanata, commonly known as the hairy gymnogramma, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds covered in fine, hairy trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The varietal name "lanata" refers to its distinctive hairy appearance, which aids in its identification.</p>
