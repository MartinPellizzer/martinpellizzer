<p>Gnaphalium caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy, narrow leaves. Native to the Caucasus region, it thrives in moist, often alpine or mountainous environments. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across rocky and grassy habitats.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to cold climates, with compact growth and a low profile to reduce exposure to harsh weather.</p>
