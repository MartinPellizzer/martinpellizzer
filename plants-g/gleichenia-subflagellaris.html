<p>Gleichenia subflagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Gleichenia subflagellaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
