                    <h1>Guzmania palustris</h1>
<p>Guzmania palustris, commonly known as the marsh bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect water. The plant's foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, boggy habitat. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Guzmania palustris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
