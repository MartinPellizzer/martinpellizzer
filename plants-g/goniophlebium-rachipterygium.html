<p>Goniophlebium rachipterygium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear spirally arranged leaves, which are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
