<p>Goniopteris abrupta, commonly known as the abrupt fern, is a member of the water fern family, Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a small, rounded shield. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are borne on the undersides of the leaves and contain spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Goniopteris abrupta is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich aquatic habitats.</p>
