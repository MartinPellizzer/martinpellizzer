                    <h1>Ginkgo biloba f. fastigiata</h1>
<p>Ginkgo biloba f. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright ginkgo, is a unique cultivar characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit.</p>
<p>It features fan-shaped leaves that are typically darker green and more elongated compared to the standard ginkgo. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and produces distinctive, foul-smelling seeds in the autumn. It is well-suited for small spaces due to its compact form and is often used as a street tree or ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of this variety make it a popular choice for urban landscaping.</p>
