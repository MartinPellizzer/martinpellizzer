                    <h1>Gaertnera liberiensis</h1>
<p>Gaertnera liberiensis, commonly known as the Liberian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits. Gaertnera liberiensis is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and faces conservation challenges.</p>
