<p>Glechoma hederacea var. longituba, commonly known as creeping ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, blue-violet flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a valued ornamental plant.</p>
