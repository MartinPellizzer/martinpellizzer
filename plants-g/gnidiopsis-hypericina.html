                    <h1>Gnidiopsis hypericina</h1>
<p>Gnidiopsis hypericina, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, showy red flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
