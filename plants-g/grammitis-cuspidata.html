                    <h1>Grammitis cuspidata</h1>
<p>Grammitis cuspidata, commonly known as the spike-tipped moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, and its sporangia are clustered at the tips of the leaves, giving it its common name. Grammitis cuspidata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its delicate structure and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions make it a characteristic component of forest understories.</p>
