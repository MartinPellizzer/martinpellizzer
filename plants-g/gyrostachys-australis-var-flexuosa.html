                    <h1>Gyrostachys australis var. flexuosa</h1>
<p>Gyrostachys australis var. flexuosa, commonly known as the weeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with pale green, fleshy leaves that curl downward, giving it a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of sunlight and heat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
