<p>Glandularia rectiloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Glandularia rectiloba is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its glandular hairs on the leaves and stems help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for drought conditions.</p>
