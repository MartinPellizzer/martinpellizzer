                    <h1>Genlisea tuberosa</h1>
<p>Genlisea tuberosa, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are modified into these bladders, which are used to capture prey. It thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
<p>Its unique trapping mechanism makes it an interesting subject in the study of plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
