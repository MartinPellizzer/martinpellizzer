                    <h1>Gmelina dalrympleana</h1>
<p>Gmelina dalrympleana, commonly known as the Dalrymple's gum tree, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and hardiness, it is sometimes used in reforestation projects.</p>
