                    <h1>Gaultheria tristis</h1>
<p>Gaultheria tristis, commonly known as the evergreen trailing twinflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds used in traditional medicine and as a source of methyl salicylate.</p>
