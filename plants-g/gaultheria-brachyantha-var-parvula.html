                    <h1>Gaultheria brachyantha var. parvula</h1>
<p>Gaultheria brachyantha var. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance and produces small, urn-shaped white flowers in the spring. The plant is noted for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, giving it a wintergreen scent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Gaultheria brachyantha, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
