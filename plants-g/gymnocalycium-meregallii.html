                    <h1>Gymnocalycium meregallii</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium meregallii, commonly known as the Meregallii cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and typically produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium meregallii is well-suited for cultivation in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
