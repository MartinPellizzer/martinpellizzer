<p>Gutierrezia goldmanii, commonly known as golden galleta, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, branching structure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Gutierrezia goldmanii is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
