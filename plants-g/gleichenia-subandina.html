<p>Gleichenia subandina, commonly known as the Andean maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense mats, which help in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
