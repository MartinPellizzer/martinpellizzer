                    <h1>Goodyera gracilis</h1>
<p>Goodyera gracilis, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and its intricate, spiral arrangement of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, where it thrives in the dappled light of the forest understory. Goodyera gracilis has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly through the forest floor.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of the understory flora in its native range.</p>
