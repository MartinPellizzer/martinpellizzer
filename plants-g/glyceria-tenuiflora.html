<p>Glyceria tenuiflora, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Glyceria tenuiflora plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
