                    <h1>Glyceria acutiflora</h1>
<p>Glyceria acutiflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, preferring moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
<p>Glyceria acutiflora is also used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
