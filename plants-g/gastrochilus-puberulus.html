<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Gastrochilus puberulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
