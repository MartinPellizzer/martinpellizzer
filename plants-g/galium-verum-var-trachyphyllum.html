<p>Galium verum var. trachyphyllum, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, with small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive waxy coating, which gives the plant a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a decorative plant in gardens.</p>
