                    <h1>Gymnostoma nodiflorum</h1>
<p>Gymnostoma nodiflorum, commonly known as the clustered-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its roots penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, while it performs photosynthesis independently.</p>
<p>Gymnostoma nodiflorum is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas.</p>
