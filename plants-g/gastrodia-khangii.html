                    <h1>Gastrodia khangii</h1>
<p>Gastrodia khangii, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng or kangxi ginseng, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a tuberous plant that lacks true leaves and relies on its underground stem for photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often wrinkled tuber, which contains the active compounds responsible for its medicinal properties. Gastrodia khangii thrives in cool, humid climates and is typically found in shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
