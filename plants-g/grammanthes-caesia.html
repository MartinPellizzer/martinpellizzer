                    <h1>Grammanthes caesia</h1>
<p>Grammanthes caesia, commonly known as the blue-eyed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. Grammanthes caesia is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or limestone areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
