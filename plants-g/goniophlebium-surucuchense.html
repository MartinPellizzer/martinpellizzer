<p>Goniophlebium surucuchense, commonly known as the Surucu√ßu fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a unique, intricate venation pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are typically located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
