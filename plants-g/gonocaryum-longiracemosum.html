                    <h1>Gonocaryum longiracemosum</h1>
<p>Gonocaryum longiracemosum, commonly known as the long-branch cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered cones, with the male cones typically appearing at the base of the plant. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is native to Madagascar and is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological significance.</p>
