<p>Guzmania lemeana, commonly known as the Lemeana bromeliad, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a flower. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life. Its roots are primarily for anchoring rather than nutrient absorption, as it is an epiphyte.</p>
<p>Guzmania lemeana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
