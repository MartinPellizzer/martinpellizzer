<p>Gymnanthemum coursii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and can withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gymnanthemum coursii is adapted to hot, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
