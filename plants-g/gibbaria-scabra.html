<p>Gibbaria scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
