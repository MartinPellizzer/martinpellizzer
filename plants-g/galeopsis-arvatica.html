                    <h1>Galeopsis arvatica</h1>
<p>Galeopsis arvatica, commonly known as common hedge nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in whorled clusters. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant disperses its seeds via wind.</p>
<p>Galeopsis arvatica is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
