                    <h1>Gagea × pampaninii</h1>
<p>Gagea × pampaninii, commonly known as the hybrid gagea, is a species resulting from the cross between Gagea lutea and Gagea bulbifera.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
