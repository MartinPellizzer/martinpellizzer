                    <h1>Gnaphalium crassifolium</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium crassifolium is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
