<p>Gymnopteris ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the Ehrenberg's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Gymnopteris ehrenbergiana is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
