<p>Gnaphalium hookerianum, commonly known as Hooker's feather grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance due to its numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habit make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
