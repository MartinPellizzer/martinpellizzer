<p>Grammitis carrascoensis, commonly known as the Carrasco's spikemoss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperjaniaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and needle-like leaves. Native to the tropical regions of Central America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a unique structure with a short, underground stem and a rosette of leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its role in the forest floor's ecological dynamics.</p>
