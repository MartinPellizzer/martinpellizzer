<p>Gnaphalium ruricola, commonly known as the field cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features small, silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces numerous tiny, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and fields.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium ruricola is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
