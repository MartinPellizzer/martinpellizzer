                    <h1>Gastrodia schinziana</h1>
<p>Gastrodia schinziana, commonly known as the Chinese club moss or simply gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid-like plant native to the mountainous regions of China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, club-shaped structure that contains its seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal value and habitat loss, it is highly protected in many regions.</p>
