<p>Gynerium ramosum, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshes in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist environments.</p>
<p>Gynerium ramosum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
