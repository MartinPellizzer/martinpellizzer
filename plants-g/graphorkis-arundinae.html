<p>Graphorkis arundinae, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
