<p>Gnaphalium debile, commonly known as the slender groundsel, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and features narrow, linear leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a fibrous root system and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium debile is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
