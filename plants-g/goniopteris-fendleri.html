<p>Goniopteris fendleri, commonly known as the Arizona cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on cliff faces or in crevices where moisture is retained. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Goniopteris fendleri plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in association with other drought-tolerant flora.</p>
