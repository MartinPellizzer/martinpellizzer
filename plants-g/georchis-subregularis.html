                    <h1>Georchis subregularis</h1>
<p>Georchis subregularis, commonly known as the common ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their lack of showy petals. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique example of a photosynthetic orchid.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native environment.</p>
