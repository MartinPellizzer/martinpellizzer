                    <h1>Gastrodia elata var. obovata</h1>
<p>Gastrodia elata var. obovata, commonly known as the obovate thunder god vine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces unique, fleshy, yellowish-orange tubers that are highly valued in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in a spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
