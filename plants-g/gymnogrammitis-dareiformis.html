<p>Gymnogrammitis dareiformis, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a tiny waterwheel. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporocarps, are borne on the underside of the leaves and release spores into the water.</p>
<p>Gymnogrammitis dareiformis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
