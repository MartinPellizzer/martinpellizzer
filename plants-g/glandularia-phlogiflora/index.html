                            <h1>Glandularia Phlogiflora</h1>
<p>Fireplant, scientifically known as Glandularia phlogiflora, is a striking member of the mint family native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. Its vivid red and orange flowers resemble flames, giving it its dramatic common name. This resilient plant thrives in hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats. With its unique appearance and ecological importance, it has become a symbol of the rugged beauty of desert landscapes. Despite its fiery look, the Fireplant is a valuable species for pollinators and a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
