<p>Gnomonia octoflora, commonly known as the eight-flowered gnomon, is a rare and unusual plant species belonging to the family Gnomoniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of eight small, cup-like flowers arranged in a circular pattern. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Gnomonia octoflora plays a minor but important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for certain insect species.</p>
