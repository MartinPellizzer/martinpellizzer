                    <h1>Gossypium australe var. pedunculatum</h1>
<p>Gossypium australe var. pedunculatum, commonly known as the Australian cotton tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which often branch out into a dense, bushy form. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the ends of its branches. Its cotton-like seed pods contain fibers that are harvested for textile use, though the plant is primarily valued for its ecological role in arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Gossypium australe var. pedunculatum is adapted to survive in low-water environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
