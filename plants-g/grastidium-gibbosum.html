                    <h1>Grastidium gibbosum</h1>
<p>Grastidium gibbosum, commonly known as the globular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Grastidium gibbosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in xerophytic gardens.</p>
