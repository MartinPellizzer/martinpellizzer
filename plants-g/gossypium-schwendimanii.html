                    <h1>Gossypium schwendimanii</h1>
<p>Gossypium schwendimanii, commonly known as the Schwendiman cotton, is a rare and ancient species of cotton native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous seed hairs, which are similar to those of other cotton species but exhibit unique structural features. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing pale green to yellow blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
