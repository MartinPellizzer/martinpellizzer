<p>Galatella hyssopifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
