                    <h1>Gyrotaenia trinervata</h1>
<p>Gyrotaenia trinervata, commonly known as the three-veined bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with two lips, typical of the Orobanchaceae family, though it is more closely related to the Lentibulariaceae. It is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it can anchor itself to substrates.</p>
<p>Gyrotaenia trinervata is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping small aquatic organisms using its specialized bladder-like structures.</p>
