                    <h1>Gossypium incanum</h1>
<p>Gossypium incanum, commonly known as the woolly cotton or desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its cotton-like fibers are covered in fine, white hairs. Gossypium incanum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential in sustainable agriculture.</p>
