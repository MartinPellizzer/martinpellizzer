                    <h1>Galpinia</h1>
<p>Galpinia, commonly known as the African snowball, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in southern Africa, particularly in regions like South Africa and Namibia. These shrubs or small trees are characterized by their dense, spherical clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, providing a contrast to the showy floral displays.</p>
<p>Galpinia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
