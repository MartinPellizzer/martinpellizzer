<p>Galium lucidum subsp.</p>
<p>cinereum, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its low-growing habit and ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
