                    <h1>Gonolobus stapelioides</h1>
<p>Gonolobus stapelioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cluster of small lanterns. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Gonolobus stapelioides is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
