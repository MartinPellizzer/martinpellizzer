<p>Grumilea fissistipula, commonly known as the fissistipula grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive fissured or split appearance along the leaf tips. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically greenish or pale in color. It is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Grumilea fissistipula plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
