<p>Gymnopsis wedelioides, commonly known as the wedgeleaf cactus, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and reduced leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
