<p>Gymnotrix compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue to black berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
