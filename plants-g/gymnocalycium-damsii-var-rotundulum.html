<p>Gymnocalycium damsii var. rotundulum, commonly known as the rounded moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among cactus enthusiasts due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
