<p>Grindelia procera, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Grindelia procera is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
