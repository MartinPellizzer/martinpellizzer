<p>Goniopteris serrulata, commonly known as the serrated moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Goniopteris serrulata is a relic species with a long evolutionary history, often found in paleobotanical records from the Mesozoic era.</p>
