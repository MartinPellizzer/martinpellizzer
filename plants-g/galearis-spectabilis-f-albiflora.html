                    <h1>Galearis spectabilis f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Galearis spectabilis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pinkroot, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of pale white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed fruit. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
