<p>Gastrodia qingyunshanensis, commonly known as the Qingyunshan ginseng, is a rare orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, underground rhizome and a single, erect stem with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower, which is typical of the Gastrodia genus.
