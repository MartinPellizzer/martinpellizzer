<p>Gymnocladus arabica, commonly known as the desert bean tree, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that are often shed during drought periods. The plant produces small, green flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes.</p>
