                    <h1>Gagea × absurda</h1>
<p>Gagea × absurda, commonly known as the hybrid gagea, is a rare and intriguing plant species resulting from the cross between two species of the genus Gagea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant is native to specific regions in the western United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
<p>Its floral structure and growth habits provide insights into the evolutionary adaptations of bulbous plants in temperate climates.</p>
