<p>Geum rivale monstrosum, commonly known as the giant water avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, calcareous habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in wet environments such as marshes and stream sides. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers with five petals, arranged in a cluster at the tip of each stem. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a distinctive waxy coating.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
