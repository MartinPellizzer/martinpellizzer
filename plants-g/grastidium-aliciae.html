                    <h1>Grastidium aliciae</h1>
<p>Grastidium aliciae, commonly known as the Alice's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the humid cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grastidium aliciae is considered a highly endangered species.</p>
