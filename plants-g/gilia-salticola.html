                <h1>Gilia salticola</h1>
<p>Gilia salticola, commonly known as the jumping bean plant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, round seeds that are encased in a fibrous covering, which can be mistaken for actual jumping beans. These seeds are often harvested for their ornamental value and are used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Gilia salticola thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
