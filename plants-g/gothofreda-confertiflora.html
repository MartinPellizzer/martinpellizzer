                    <h1>Gothofreda confertiflora</h1>
<p>Gothofreda confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and clusters of small, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, a feature typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their subtle coloration and inconspicuous appearance.</p>
<p>Gothofreda confertiflora is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a valuable indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
