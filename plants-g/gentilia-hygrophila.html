                    <h1>Gentilia hygrophila</h1>
<p>Gentilia hygrophila, commonly known as the water gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its moist environment. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to aquatic conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
