                    <h1>Gynaion vestitum</h1>
<p>Gynaion vestitum, commonly known as the dressed female, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its intricate floral structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is distinguished by its compound umbel inflorescence, which resembles a crown. The plant's most notable botanical feature is its gynoecious nature, meaning it produces only female flowers, making it a rare example of sexual dimorphism in the plant kingdom. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
