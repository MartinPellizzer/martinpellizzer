<p>Gagnebina commersoniana subsp.</p>
<p>calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola gagnebina, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
