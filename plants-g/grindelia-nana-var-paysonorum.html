<p>Grindelia nana var. paysonorum, commonly known as Payson dwarf gumweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>
