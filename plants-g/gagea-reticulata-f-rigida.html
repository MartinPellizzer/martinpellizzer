                    <h1>Gagea reticulata f. rigida</h1>
<p>Gagea reticulata f. rigida, commonly known as the rigid netted squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, reticulate pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky or well-drained soils, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more rigid and upright leaf structure compared to the typical form of Gagea reticulata.</p>
