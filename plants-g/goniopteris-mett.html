<p>Goniopteris mett, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that can reach several meters in length, with a distinctive, lobed frond structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Goniopteris mett plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
