                    <h1>Gaultheria tenuifolia var. promaucana</h1>
<p>Gaultheria tenuifolia var. promaucana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Gaultheria tenuifolia.</p>
