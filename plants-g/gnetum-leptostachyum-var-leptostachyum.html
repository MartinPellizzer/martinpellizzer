<p>Gnetum leptostachyum var. leptostachyum, commonly known as the slender-stalked gnetum, is a unique gymnosperm native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dioecious nature, with separate male and female plants, and possesses a distinctive morphology with scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a robust, woody stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among gymnosperms.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its evolutionary significance and ecological role in tropical forests.</p>
