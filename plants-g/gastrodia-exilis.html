                    <h1>Gastrodia exilis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia exilis, commonly known as the slender thunder god, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, yellowish-brown rhizome, which is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on the roots of other trees in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and medicinal value, Gastrodia exilis is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
