<p>Grammitis monticola, commonly known as the mountain grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis monticola plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
