<p>Galium parisiense var. willkommianum, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common but often overlooked component of wetland and forest ecosystems.</p>
