                            <h1>Gnaphalium Pyramidatum</h1>
<p>Common fleabane, scientifically known as Gnaphalium pyramidatum, is a hardy perennial plant native to North America. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, fluffy white or grayish flower heads that resemble small clouds. Its common name originates from its historical use as a natural remedy for fleas and other pests. Despite its delicate appearance, Common fleabane is resilient and often serves as an important nectar source for pollinators.</p>
