<p>Gymnosphaera andohahelensis, commonly known as the Andohahela gymnosperm, is a rare and unique plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Gnetales, which is a small group of gymnosperms that are often considered transitional between conifers and angiosperms. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, woody structure and produces small, scale-like leaves. Gymnosphaera andohahelensis is notable for its limited distribution and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
