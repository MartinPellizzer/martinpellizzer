<p>Gnaphalium panniforme, commonly known as the woolly groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, felt-like foliage composed of tiny, overlapping leaves that give it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium panniforme is often found in rocky soils and dry slopes, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
