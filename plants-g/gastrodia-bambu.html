                    <h1>Gastrodia bambu</h1>
<p>Gastrodia bambu, commonly known as the bamboo orchid, is a unique parasitic plant belonging to the orchid family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host bamboo for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces a thick, fleshy, and often aromatic underground tuber that is prized in traditional medicine. It blooms with small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is rarely found in the wild and is difficult to cultivate.</p>
