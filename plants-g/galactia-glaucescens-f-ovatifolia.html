                    <h1>Galactia glaucescens f. ovatifolia</h1>
<p>Galactia glaucescens f. ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are legumes that contain seeds covered in a sticky, milky sap, a feature typical of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaflets compared to the typical form of Galactia glaucescens.</p>
