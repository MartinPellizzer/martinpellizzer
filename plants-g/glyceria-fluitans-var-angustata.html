                    <h1>Glyceria fluitans var. angustata</h1>
<p>Glyceria fluitans var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf floating grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in dense spikes, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It is often found in marshes, pond edges, and slow-moving streams across temperate regions.</p>
