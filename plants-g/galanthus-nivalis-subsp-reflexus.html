<p>Galanthus nivalis subsp.</p>
<p>reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed snowdrop, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive white, reflexed (bent backward) flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in woodland areas and shaded rock crevices, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous root system.</p>
<p>The subspecies is closely related to the common snowdrop, Galanthus nivalis, but differs in the shape of its petals and flowering behavior.</p>
