<p>Gnaphalium scandens, commonly known as the creeping cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb low structures. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a silvery underside that gives it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium scandens is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
