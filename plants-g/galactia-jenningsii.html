<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain spherical seeds, which are often used in restoration ecology due to their hardiness. Galactia jenningsii thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
