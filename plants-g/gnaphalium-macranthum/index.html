                            <h1>Gnaphalium Macranthum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium macranthum is a small flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is commonly known as the clustered cudweed and belongs to the Asteraceae family. This species is characterized by its dense clusters of small white flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Despite its modest appearance, Gnaphalium macranthum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
