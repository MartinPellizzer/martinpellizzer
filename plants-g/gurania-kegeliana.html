                    <h1>Gurania kegeliana</h1>
<p>Gurania kegeliana, commonly known as the Kegeliana burr cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like pumpkins and gourds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and oblong, spiny fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and tend to trail along the ground.</p>
<p>The fruit's spines and bitter taste make it less desirable for culinary use but valuable for its medicinal properties.</p>
