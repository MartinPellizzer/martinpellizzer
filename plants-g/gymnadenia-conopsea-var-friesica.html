<p>Gymnadenia conopsea var. friesica, commonly known as the Fries' cowberry, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and heathlands. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with a single, erect flower spike bearing several small, white to pale pink flowers. Its flowers have a distinctive, sweet, vanilla-like scent, which attracts specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, this variety is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
