<p>Grammitis wattsii, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis wattsii plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
