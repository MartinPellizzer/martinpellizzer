<p>Gymnorebutia, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of only two species, Gymnorebutia mirabilis and Gymnorebutia pachycera, both native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their columnar stems and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom during the winter months. Gymnorebutia species are typically found in rocky, well-drained soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in cactus gardens.</p>
