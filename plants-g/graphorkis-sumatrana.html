                    <h1>Graphorkis sumatrana</h1>
<p>Graphorkis sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, and thrives in the humid, shaded understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, while its leaves are thick and waxy to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Graphorkis sumatrana is considered threatened, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
