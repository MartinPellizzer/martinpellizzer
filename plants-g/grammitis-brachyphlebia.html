                    <h1>Grammitis brachyphlebia</h1>
<p>Grammitis brachyphlebia, commonly known as the narrow-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered in dense tufts. The fronds are typically short and have a distinctive, compact growth habit, with small, scale-like structures along the leaf margins. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in rainforests.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its role in spore dispersal.</p>
