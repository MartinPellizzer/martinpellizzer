<p>Grammitis brasiliense, commonly known as Brazilian wall-r Fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis brasiliense is often found in epiphytic or lithophytic habitats, clinging to tree trunks or rocks in humid climates.</p>
