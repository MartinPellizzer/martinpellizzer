The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom during the wet season. It is an understory plant, often found growing in shaded, moist environments within dense forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
