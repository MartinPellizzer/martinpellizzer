<p>Gonzalagunia dependens, commonly known as the hanging mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences that bear small, white, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a velvety texture, while its flowers emit a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gonzalagunia dependens is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
