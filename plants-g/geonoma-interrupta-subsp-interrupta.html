<p>Geonoma interrupta subsp.</p>
<p>interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
