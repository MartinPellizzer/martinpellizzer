                    <h1>Galium reflexum</h1>
<p>Galium reflexum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its stems are typically prostrate or ascending, and they often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Galium reflexum is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges.</p>
