<p>Glochidion sambiranense, commonly known as the Sambiranense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, clustered yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its propagation in forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
