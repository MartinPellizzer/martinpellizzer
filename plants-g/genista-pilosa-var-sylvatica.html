<p>Genista pilosa var. sylvatica, commonly known as the silky broom.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to Europe and parts of North Africa, characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>While it is ornamental in gardens, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>
