                    <h1>Geracium chondrilloides</h1>
<p>Geracium chondrilloides, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Geracium chondrilloides is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats.</p>
