<p>Graphorkis mannii, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and ability to thrive in rocky, saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Graphorkis mannii is valued for its resilience and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardy nature.</p>
