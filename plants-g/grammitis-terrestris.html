                    <h1>Grammitis terrestris</h1>
<p>Grammitis terrestris, commonly known as the creeping grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow close to the ground, forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis terrestris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
