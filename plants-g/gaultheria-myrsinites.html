<p>Gaultheria myrsinites, commonly known as the wintergreen shrub, is a species native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest in North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in the fall. These berries contain high concentrations of methyl salicylate, which gives them their characteristic wintergreen scent and flavor.</p>
<p>Gaultheria myrsinites is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant landscaping.</p>
