                    <h1>Galium incrassatum</h1>
<p>Galium incrassatum, commonly known as sticky bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Galium incrassatum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained habitats.</p>
