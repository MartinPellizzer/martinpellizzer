<p>Gymnosphaera kemberangana, commonly known as the Kemberangana cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants, a feature common among cycads. Gymnosphaera kemberangana is native to a limited geographic region in Australia and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
