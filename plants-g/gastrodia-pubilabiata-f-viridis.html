                    <h1>Gastrodia pubilabiata f. viridis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia pubilabiata f. viridis, commonly known as the green-flowered form of the mountain gastrodia, is a rare and unique variant of the gastrodia plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow flowers, which differ from the typical brownish hues of the species. This fern-like orchid is native to the high-altitude regions of China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is known for its fleshy, tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
