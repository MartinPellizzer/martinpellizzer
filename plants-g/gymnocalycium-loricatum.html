<p>Gymnocalycium loricatum, commonly known as the Loricatus Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a spineless cactus with a short, globular stem that often develops a fluted appearance as it matures. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in the spring. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium loricatum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
