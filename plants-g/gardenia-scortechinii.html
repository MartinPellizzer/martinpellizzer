<p>Gardenia scortechinii, commonly known as the dwarf gardenia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden spaces.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
