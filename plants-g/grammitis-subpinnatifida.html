<p>Grammitis subpinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved moss fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. The leaves are pinnately divided with a sub-pinnate arrangement, giving it a finely divided, lace-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
