<p>Geschollia prolifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil in its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Geschollia prolifera is an important component of biodiversity in its native ecosystems and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants.</p>
