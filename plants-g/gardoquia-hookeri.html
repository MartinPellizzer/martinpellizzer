<p>Gardoquia hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's gardoquia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gardoquia hookeri is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
