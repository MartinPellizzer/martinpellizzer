                    <h1>Gela</h1>
<p>Gela, commonly known as the "Chinese evergreen," is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often enclosed within a spathe, a modified leaf-like structure. Gela thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers indirect light.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clusters, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
