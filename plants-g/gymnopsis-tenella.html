<p>Gymnopsis tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gymnopsis tenella is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in stabilizing soil and supporting other vegetation in its ecosystem.</p>
