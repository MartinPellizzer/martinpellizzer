                    <h1>Gutierrezia ruiz-lealii</h1>
<p>Gutierrezia ruiz-lealii, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep root systems and a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Gutierrezia ruiz-lealii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native insects and wildlife.</p>
