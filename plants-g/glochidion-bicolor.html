                    <h1>Glochidion bicolor</h1>
<p>Glochidion bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and typically grows on the branches of other trees, drawing nutrients and water from its host. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually green on the upper surface and pale or white on the underside, giving it its name. It produces tiny yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
