                    <h1>Grindelia fastigiata var. revoluta</h1>
<p>Grindelia fastigiata var. revoluta, commonly known as the revolute bluemink, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery resin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The resinous coating on its leaves helps to reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores.</p>
