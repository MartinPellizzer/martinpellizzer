<p>Glycyrrhiza gontscharovii, commonly known as the Central Asian licorice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by legume pods containing several seeds. Glycyrrhiza gontscharovii is valued for its roots, which contain glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine and as a sweetener.</p>
