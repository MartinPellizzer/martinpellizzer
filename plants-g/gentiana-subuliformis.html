<p>Gentiana subuliformis, commonly known as the slender gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The slender gentian is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ecological benefits.</p>
