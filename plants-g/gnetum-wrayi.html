                    <h1>Gnetum wrayi</h1>
<p>Gnetum wrayi, commonly known as the African gymnosperm, is a unique plant belonging to the Gnetophyta division, which is closely related to conifers.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce seeds without cones, a feature that sets it apart from most other gymnosperms. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple leaves that are often leathery in texture. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Despite its primitive features, Gnetum wrayi plays an important ecological role in its native habitats across Africa.</p>
