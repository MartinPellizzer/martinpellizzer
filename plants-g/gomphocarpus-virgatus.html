<p>Gomphocarpus virgatus, commonly known as the milkweed or the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Gomphocarpus virgatus is also known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
