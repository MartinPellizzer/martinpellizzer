                    <h1>Goodyera × tamnaensis</h1>
<p>Goodyera × tamnaensis, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Goodyera velutina and Goodyera robusta.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a creeping rhizome system and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories across parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
