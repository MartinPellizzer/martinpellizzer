                    <h1>Gnephosis drummondii</h1>
<p>Gnephosis drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded habitats, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a very limited geographic range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
