                    <h1>Gymnocalycium berchtii var. nataliae</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium berchtii var. nataliae, commonly known as Natal's moon cactus, is a compact cactus species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in white, woolly spines that provide protection against herbivores and extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival during droughts.</p>
<p>This variety is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
