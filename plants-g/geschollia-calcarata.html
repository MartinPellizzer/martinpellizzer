                    <h1>Geschollia calcarata</h1>
<p>Geschollia calcarata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Geschollia calcarata is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
