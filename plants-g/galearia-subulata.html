                    <h1>Galearia subulata</h1>
<p>Galearia subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a dense, leathery texture. The lower surface is covered in white to pale yellowish rhizines, which aid in anchoring the lichen to substrates. It typically grows on bark, soil, or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
