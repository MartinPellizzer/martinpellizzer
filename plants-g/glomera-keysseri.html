<p>Glomera keysseri, commonly known as the Keyser's glomera, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features a short, stocky rhizome with a few leaves and a single, showy inflorescence. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
