                    <h1>Gomphostylis candida</h1>
<p>Gomphostylis candida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
