<p>Gymnocalycium stellatum var. zantnerianum, commonly known as the Zantner's star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
