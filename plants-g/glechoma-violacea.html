                    <h1>Glechoma violacea</h1>
<p>Glechoma violacea, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant spreads via runners, forming dense mats that can cover large areas, making it both a decorative ground cover and a potential weed. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its genus, Glechoma, which is derived from the Greek word for "to creep," referring to its spreading growth habit.</p>
