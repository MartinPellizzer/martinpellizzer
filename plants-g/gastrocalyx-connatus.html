                    <h1>Gastrocalyx connatus</h1>
<p>Gastrocalyx connatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gastrocalyx, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers have a distinctive, elongated lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
