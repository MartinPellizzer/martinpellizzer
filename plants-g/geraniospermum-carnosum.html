                    <h1>Geraniospermum carnosum</h1>
<p>Geraniospermum carnosum, commonly known as the fleshy geranium, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, thick-leaved structure that helps it store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its stems and leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which further reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Geraniospermum carnosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates.</p>
