<p>Griffinia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones more compact. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Griffinia rostrata is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological significance in Madagascar's flora.</p>
