<p>Gastrodia flexistyla, commonly known as the flexible thunder god, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, fleshy, yellowish-brown capsules as its fruit, which contain the seeds. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellow, with a distinctive, twisted shape.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gastrodia flexistyla is considered an endangered species.</p>
