                            <h1>Genista Cephalantha Subsp. Demnatensis</h1>
<p>Caucasian broom, scientifically known as Genista cephalantha subsp. demnatensis, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. This subspecies is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique plant from environmental threats and habitat loss.</p>
