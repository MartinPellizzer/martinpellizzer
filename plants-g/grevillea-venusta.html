                    <h1>Grevillea venusta</h1>
<p>Grevillea venusta, commonly known as the silky grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silver-green leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it produces vibrant red or orange flowers in late winter to spring. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract birds, particularly honeyeaters, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Grevillea venusta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
