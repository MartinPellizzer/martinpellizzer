<p>Genista × hybrida, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a hybrid shrub belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, often thorny stems and small, trifoliate leaves. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula but has been introduced to other regions as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas outside its native range.</p>
