                    <h1>Gompholobium</h1>
<p>Gompholobium, commonly known as the hakea or burr bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny pods and small, clustered flowers. Many species have compound leaves with alternating pairs of leaflets, and some possess specialized structures called "burr-like" seed pods that aid in seed dispersal. They are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with deep root systems and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Gompholobium species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in supporting native wildlife.</p>
