<p>Grosvenoria lopezii, commonly known as the Lopez's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant has a unique epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grosvenoria lopezii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
