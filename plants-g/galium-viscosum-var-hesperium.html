                    <h1>Galium viscosum var. hesperium</h1>
<p>Galium viscosum var. hesperium, commonly known as sticky willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often covered in a sticky, glandular resin. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in cymes, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions on its stems and leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and aid in water retention.</p>
