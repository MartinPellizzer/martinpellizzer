                    <h1>Galanthus alpinus var. alpinus</h1>
<p>Galanthus alpinus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers usually bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are characterized by their distinctive yellow-green tips. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is also notable for its role in the broader genus Galanthus, which includes many species of snowdrops.</p>
