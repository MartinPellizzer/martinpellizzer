                    <h1>Gasteria × metallica</h1>
<p>Gasteria × metallica, commonly known as the hybrid African violet plant, is a succulent belonging to the Asphodelaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale yellow, emerging from the center of the rosette. Native to South Africa, it thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
