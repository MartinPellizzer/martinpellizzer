                    <h1>Genosiris fragilis</h1>
<p>Genosiris fragilis, commonly known as the brittle genosiris, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has palmate leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Genosiris fragilis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
