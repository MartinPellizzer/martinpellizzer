<p>Gutenbergia arenarioides, commonly known as the sandstone rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and drought-resistant nature make it well adapted to sandy and rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
