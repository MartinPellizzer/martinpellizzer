<p>Gymnopogon toldensis, commonly known as the Toldan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
