                    <h1>Goniopteris tetragona var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Goniopteris tetragona var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a fern species characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can reach several meters in length.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a unique aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are divided into small, floating lobes that help in photosynthesis and oxygenation of the water.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
