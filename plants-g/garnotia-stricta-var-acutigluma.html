<p>Garnotia stricta var. acutigluma, commonly known as the narrowleaf garnotia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in native flora.</p>
