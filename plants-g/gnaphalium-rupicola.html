<p>Gnaphalium rupicola, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a fine, powdery coating on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium rupicola is often used in dryland gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
