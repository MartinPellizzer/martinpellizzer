<p>Glomera papuana, commonly known as the Papuan glomera, is a flowering plant native to the highland regions of Papua, Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are often hairy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Glomera papuana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
