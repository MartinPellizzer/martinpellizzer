<p>Gomphrena desertorum var. mucronata, commonly known as the desert bluemink, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its striking, papery blue to purple bract-like flowers that resemble tiny mink-like tails. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by colorful, leaf-like bracts, which are the primary ornamental feature. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
