                    <h1>Geraniospermum</h1>
<p>Geraniospermum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. They are characterized by their woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, often pink or red, flowers. Geraniospermum species typically have a deep root system that allows them to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>They play an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and small mammals.</p>
