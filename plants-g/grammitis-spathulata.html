<p>Grammitis spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf mossy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like structures. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis spathulata plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its habitat.</p>
