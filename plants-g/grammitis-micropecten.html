<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often translucent. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are divided into numerous small, linear segments called pinnae, which are arranged in a feather-like pattern.</p>
<p>Grammitis micropecten thrives in humid environments and is often found in rainforests or shaded, moist habitats.</p>
