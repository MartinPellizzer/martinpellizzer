<p>Gymnocarpium remotum, commonly known as the naked-seed fern, is a member of the fern family, characterized by its primitive structure and spore reproduction.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with a creeping rhizome and simple, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces naked, berry-like structures called gymnocheils, which contain the spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Gymnocarpium remotum is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and unique reproductive features.</p>
