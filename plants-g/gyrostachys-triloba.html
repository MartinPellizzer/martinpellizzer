                    <h1>Gyrostachys triloba</h1>
<p>Gyrostachys triloba, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Gyrostachys triloba is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
