<p>Geum hyrcanum, commonly known as the Persian avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often hairy as well. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in a loose, spherical inflorescence. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network, contributing to its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Geum hyrcanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
