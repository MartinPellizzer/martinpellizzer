                    <h1>Gastrodia fimbriata</h1>
<p>Gastrodia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed thunder god, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition, as it lacks chlorophyll. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gastrodia fimbriata is critically endangered and protected in several regions.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role and medicinal significance make it a subject of scientific and conservation interest.</p>
