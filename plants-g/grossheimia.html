                    <h1>Grossheimia</h1>
<p>Grossheimia, commonly known as the snowbell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plants are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale blue, and their evergreen or deciduous leaves depending on the species. Grossheimia species are often found in rocky or forested habitats, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are generally rare in cultivation.</p>
