                            <h1>Guazuma Guazuma</h1>
<p>Guazuma guazuma is a tropical tree native to Central and South America known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. It features broad leaves and produces clusters of fragrant white flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The tree is often used in landscaping due to its fast growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. Its fruit, a yellowish pod, contains seeds that are dispersed by animals and birds. Despite its beauty, it requires proper care to avoid invasive tendencies in non-native environments.</p>
