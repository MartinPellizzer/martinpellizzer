                    <h1>Galium parisiense subvar. decipiens</h1>
<p>Galium parisiense subvar. decipiens, commonly known as the false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and it often forms dense mats in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The species is sometimes mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on true nettles.</p>
