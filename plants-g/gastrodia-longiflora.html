                    <h1>Gastrodia longiflora</h1>
<p>Gastrodia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered tiger orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a single, elongated, club-shaped pseudobulb that stores energy and supports its growth. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, spurred lip that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, humid forest environments.</p>
