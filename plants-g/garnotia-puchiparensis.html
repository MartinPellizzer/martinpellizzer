<p>Garnotia puchiparensis, commonly known as the Puchipari orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and革质 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Garnotia puchiparensis is considered vulnerable and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
