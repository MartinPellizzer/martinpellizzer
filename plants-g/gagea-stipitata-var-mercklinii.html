                    <h1>Gagea stipitata var. mercklinii</h1>
<p>Gagea stipitata var. mercklinii, commonly known as the Mercklin's spring beauty, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a cluster of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
