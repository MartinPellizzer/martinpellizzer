<p>Gymnocalycium campestre, commonly known as the desert rose or the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments.

<p>Gymnocalycium campestre is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
