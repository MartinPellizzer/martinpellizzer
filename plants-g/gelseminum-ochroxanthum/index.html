                            <h1>Gelseminum Ochroxanthum</h1>
<p>Yellow trumpet vine, scientifically known as Gelseminum ochroxanthum, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. With its vibrant yellow flowers and twisting, vine-like growth habit, it captivates both botanists and gardeners alike. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it requires specific care to thrive. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for shaded gardens and greenhouses. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that certain parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, requiring caution when handling.</p>
