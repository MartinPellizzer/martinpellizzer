                    <h1>Gnephosis rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Gnephosis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are rounded and often have a bladdery structure to aid in buoyancy. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping small aquatic insects using specialized bladder-like structures. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous habit make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
