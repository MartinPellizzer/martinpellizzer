<p>Galium boreale subsp.</p>
<p>ussuriense, commonly known as the Ussuri bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia, including parts of Siberia and the Russian Far East. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, and it produces small, three-lobed berries that are edible but not particularly palatable.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
