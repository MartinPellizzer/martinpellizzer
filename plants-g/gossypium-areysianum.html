                    <h1>Gossypium areysianum</h1>
<p>Gossypium areysianum, commonly known as the Areysian cotton, is a rare and endangered species of cotton native to the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous seed hairs, which are used for textile production, though it is less commercially significant than other cotton species. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, round bolls that contain the cotton fibers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Gossypium areysianum is of interest for conservation and genetic research.</p>
