                    <h1>Guajava sprucei</h1>
<p>Guajava sprucei, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous tree native to the highlands of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, soft needles that are typically light green in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is often found in well-drained, acidic soils. Guajava sprucei is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
