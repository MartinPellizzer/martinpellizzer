                    <h1>Grevillea apiciloba</h1>
<p>Grevillea apiciloba, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in clusters, which are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Grevillea apiciloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal environments.</p>
