                    <h1>Grammitis pusilla var. lasiosora</h1>
<p>Grammitis pusilla var. lasiosora, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its hairy appearance, which gives it its scientific name "lasiosora," meaning "hairy sorus.".</p>
