                    <h1>Gothofreda stigmatosa</h1>
<p>Gothofreda stigmatosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
