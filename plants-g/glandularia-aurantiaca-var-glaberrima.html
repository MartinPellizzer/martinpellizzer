                    <h1>Glandularia aurantiaca var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Glandularia aurantiaca var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-flowered glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which aid in water retention and deter herbivores. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers, typically in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are generally narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture in contrast to the glandular features of the stems.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments.</p>
