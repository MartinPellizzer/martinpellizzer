                    <h1>Goodyera ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Goodyera ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, instead having reduced, scale-like structures. Goodyera ovalifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often associated with rich, organic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
