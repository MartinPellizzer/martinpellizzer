<p>Grastidium marginatum, commonly known as the margined grastidium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and botanical gardens.</p>
