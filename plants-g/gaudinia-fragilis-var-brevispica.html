<p>Gaudinia fragilis var. brevispica, commonly known as the short-spurred gaudinia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
