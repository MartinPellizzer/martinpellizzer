<p>Genista tinctoria subsp.</p>
<p>ovata, commonly known as the oval buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, yellowish-green leaves that are oval in shape, giving it its subspecies name.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>While it has historical uses in dye production, it is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
