                    <h1>Gomphichis epiphytica</h1>
<p>Gomphichis epiphytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
