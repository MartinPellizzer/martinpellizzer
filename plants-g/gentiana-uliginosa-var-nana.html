                    <h1>Gentiana uliginosa var. nana</h1>
<p>Gentiana uliginosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wet, boggy habitats in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the standard Gentiana uliginosa, with shorter stems and more compact growth.</p>
