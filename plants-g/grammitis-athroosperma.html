<p>Grammitis athroosperma, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a clustered growth pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis athroosperma thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
