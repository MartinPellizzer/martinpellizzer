<p>Gentianodes algida, commonly known as the cold gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and shaded environments. The plant features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Gentianodes algida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
