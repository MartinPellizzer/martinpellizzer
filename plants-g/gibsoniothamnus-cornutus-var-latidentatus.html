                    <h1>Gibsoniothamnus cornutus var. latidentatus</h1>
<p>Gibsoniothamnus cornutus var. latidentatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed bracts that enclose the fruit, which is a spiny, three-angled capsule. Its leaves are typically broad and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in sandy soils and is considered a valuable component of local ecosystems.</p>
