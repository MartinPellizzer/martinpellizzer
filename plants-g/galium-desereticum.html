                    <h1>Galium desereticum</h1>
<p>Galium desereticum, commonly known as desert bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its adaptations to dry environments include a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Galium desereticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and provides minimal forage for wildlife.</p>
