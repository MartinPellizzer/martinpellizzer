<p>Gossypium klotzschianum subsp.</p>
<p>davidsonii, commonly known as the Davidson's cotton, is a wild cotton species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pale green leaves.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically pink to red, and the plant produces fluffy, white cotton bolls that contain the fibrous material. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>
