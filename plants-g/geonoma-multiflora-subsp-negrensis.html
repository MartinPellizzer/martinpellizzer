<p>Geonoma multiflora subsp.</p>
<p>negrensis, commonly known as the Negrense fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
