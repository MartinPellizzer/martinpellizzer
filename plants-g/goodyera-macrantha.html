<p>Goodyera macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered mosquito plant, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its striking, showy flowers that are typically violet to purple in color. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and hammocks, often forming dense colonies. Its flowers are borne on tall, erect stems and are pollinated by insects, particularly flies and wasps.</p>
<p>Goodyera macrantha is an epiphytic or lithophytic plant, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks, and it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
