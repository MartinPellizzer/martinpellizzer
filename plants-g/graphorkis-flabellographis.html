<p>Graphorkis flabellographis, commonly known as the flabellographis orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that feature intricate patterns and vibrant colors, often with a distinctive flabellate (fan-like) shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique floral morphology makes it a subject of interest for both botanists and horticulturists.</p>
