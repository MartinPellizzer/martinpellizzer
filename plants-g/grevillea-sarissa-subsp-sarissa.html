<p>Grevillea sarissa subsp.</p>
<p>sarissa, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. It has a compact growth habit and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
