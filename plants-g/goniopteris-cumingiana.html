<p>Goniopteris cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, broad, and often recurved shape.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
