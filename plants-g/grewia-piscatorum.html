                    <h1>Grewia piscatorum</h1>
<p>Grewia piscatorum, commonly known as the fish-tail bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble the tail of a fish, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. These flowers give way to red, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Grewia piscatorum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
