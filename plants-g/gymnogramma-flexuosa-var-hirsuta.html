<p>Gymnogramma flexuosa var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while spreading vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
