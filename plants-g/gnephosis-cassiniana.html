<p>Gnephosis cassiniana, commonly known as the Cassin's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with a distinctive, almost ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a unique, intricate pattern that sets it apart from other fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
