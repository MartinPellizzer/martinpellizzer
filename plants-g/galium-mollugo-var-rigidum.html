<p>Galium mollugo var. rigidum, commonly known as rigid bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that are hairless or sparsely hairy, often forming dense mats. The plant has opposite, oval to elliptic leaves with serrated margins, and small, white to pale green flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits that disperse seeds through the wind.</p>
