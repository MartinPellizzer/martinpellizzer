<p>Guzmania bismarckii, commonly known as the Bismarck guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the canopy. Its rosette-shaped leaves collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small insects.</p>
<p>Guzmania bismarckii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
