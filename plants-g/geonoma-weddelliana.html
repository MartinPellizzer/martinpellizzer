<p>Geonoma weddelliana, commonly known as the Weddell's fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Geonoma weddelliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>
