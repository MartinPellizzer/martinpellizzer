                    <h1>Glyptocaryopsis distantiflora</h1>
<p>Glyptocaryopsis distantiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clump-forming) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with distantly arranged florets, which are typical of many grass species. It is often found in moist, temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
