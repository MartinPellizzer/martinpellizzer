                    <h1>Gossypium molle</h1>
<p>Gossypium molle, commonly known as the silky cotton or woolly cotton, is a species of shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and small, pink or white flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-coated capsules that contain fibrous material, which is harvested for its unique, lightweight fibers. These fibers are less commonly used in textile production compared to other cotton species but are valued for their softness and insulating properties.</p>
<p>Gossypium molle thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
