<p>It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive white, waxy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets along shorelines. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils, making it ecologically important in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Gonocarpus incanus also produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain buoyant seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
