<p>Glomera palustris var. subintegra, commonly known as the marsh glomera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers during the summer months.
