                    <h1>Galium tmoleum</h1>
<p>Galium tmoleum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>Galium tmoleum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
