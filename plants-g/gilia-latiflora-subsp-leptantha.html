<p>Gilia latiflora subsp.</p>
<p>leptantha, commonly known as the broadleaf gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This species thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often found in desert or foothill regions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich blooms.</p>
