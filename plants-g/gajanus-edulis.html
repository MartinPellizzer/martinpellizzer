                    <h1>Gajanus edulis</h1>
<p>Gajanus edulis, commonly known as the African catfish, is a freshwater fish rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>However, if you were referring to a plant with a similar name, please clarify. I cannot provide information on a botanical plant named Gajanus edulis.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
