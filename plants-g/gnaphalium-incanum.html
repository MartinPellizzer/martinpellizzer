                    <h1>Gnaphalium incanum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium incanum, commonly known as silverleaf groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium incanum is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
