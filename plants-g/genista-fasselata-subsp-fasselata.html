<p>Genista fasselata subsp.</p>
<p>fasselata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to dry, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
