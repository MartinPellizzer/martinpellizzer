                    <h1>Guapira obtusata</h1>
<p>Guapira obtusata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian cherry, is a deciduous tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. Guapira obtusata is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
