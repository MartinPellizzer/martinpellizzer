                    <h1>Gymnocalycium achirasense var. orientale</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium achirasense var. orientale, commonly known as the Oriental Moon Cactus, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green or blue-green stems. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'orientale' is distinguished by its specific coloration and growth patterns compared to the typical form of the species.</p>
