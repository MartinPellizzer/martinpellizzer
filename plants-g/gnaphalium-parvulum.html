<p>Gnaphalium parvulum, commonly known as the small white cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, hairy leaves and produces fluffy, white to pale yellow flower heads that are often mistaken for dandelions. The plant is characterized by its finely divided leaves and the presence of glandular hairs that release a sticky, aromatic substance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium parvulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
