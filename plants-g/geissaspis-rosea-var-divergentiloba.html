<p>Geissaspis rosea var. divergentiloba, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and compact, moss-like growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky substrates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid or semi-arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
