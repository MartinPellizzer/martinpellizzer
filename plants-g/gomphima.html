                    <h1>Gomphima</h1>
<p>Gomphima, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, fleshy stem and produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Gomphima is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
