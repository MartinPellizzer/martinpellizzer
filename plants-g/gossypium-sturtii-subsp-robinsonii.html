<p>Gossypium sturtii subsp.</p>
<p>robinsonii, commonly known as Sturt's cotton, is a wild cotton species native to Australia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, with small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are similar to those of cultivated cotton, though it is not widely used for commercial purposes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and potential for genetic diversity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
