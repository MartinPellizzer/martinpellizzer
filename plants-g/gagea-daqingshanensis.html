<p>Gagea daqingshanensis, commonly known as the Daqingshan gagea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, preferring cool and moist environments. Its limited distribution and unique morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its ecological role and full biological characteristics remain poorly understood.</p>
