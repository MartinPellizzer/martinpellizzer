                    <h1>Gymnema sylvestre var. decaisneanum</h1>
<p>Gymnema sylvestre var. decaisneanum, commonly known as the Indian bitter melon or the sugar plant, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to inhibit sweet taste perception, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. Its fruits, which are typically bitter and seedy, are used in traditional medicine for their purported hypoglycemic effects.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and pharmacological contexts.</p>
