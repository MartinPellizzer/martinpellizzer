<p>Gaultheria pernettyoides, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern South America.</p>

The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries resembling strawberries. These berries are rich in antioxidants and contain the compound methyl salicylate, which gives them their distinctive medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Gaultheria pernettyoides is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
