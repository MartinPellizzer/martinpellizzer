<p>Gymnocalycium, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a genus of cacti native to South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their globular or cylindrical stems, which are typically covered in spines and sometimes have a colorful, fleshy covering called a cephalium. Gymnocalycium species are often cultivated for their striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are drought-tolerant and prefer well-draining soil, making them suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are popular in succulent collections due to their unique appearance and ease of care.</p>
