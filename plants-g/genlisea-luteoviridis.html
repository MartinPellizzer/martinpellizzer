<p>Genlisea luteoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-green bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form bladder-like traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms.

Its yellow-green foliage and translucent bladders are adaptations that enhance its ability to attract and trap prey.</p>
<p>Genlisea luteoviridis is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological significance.</p>
