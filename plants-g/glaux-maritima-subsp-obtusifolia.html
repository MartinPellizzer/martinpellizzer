<p>Glaux maritima subsp.</p>
<p>obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved sea bladder, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like stems that store water, aiding survival in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, thick, and often rounded, reducing water loss through transpiration. It typically grows in tidal zones and is found along the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to withstand harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
