<p>Genoplesium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Genoplesium species typically grow as terrestrial or epiphytic herbs, with strap-like leaves and highly specialized pollination mechanisms. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many species are considered endangered.</p>
