<p>Graphorkis beravensis, commonly known as the Beravensian orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, featuring showy, often brightly colored petals and a distinctive labellum. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy habitats, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
