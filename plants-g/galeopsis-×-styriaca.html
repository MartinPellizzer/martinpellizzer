                    <h1>Galeopsis × styriaca</h1>
<p>Galeopsis × styriaca, commonly known as the hybrid blueweed, is a composite plant belonging to the family Lamiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Galeopsis tetrahit and Galeopsis speciosa. The plant typically exhibits features of both parent species, including blue to purple flowers and lance-shaped leaves. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest in botanical studies.</p>
