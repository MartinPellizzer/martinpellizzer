                    <h1>Galeopsis ladanum var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Galeopsis ladanum var. arenaria, commonly known as sand galeopsis, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
