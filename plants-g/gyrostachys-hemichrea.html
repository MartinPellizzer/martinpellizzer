<p>Gyrostachys hemichrea, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
