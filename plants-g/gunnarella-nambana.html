<p>Gunnarella nambana, commonly known as the Namban bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Gunnarella nambana plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for native wildlife.</p>
