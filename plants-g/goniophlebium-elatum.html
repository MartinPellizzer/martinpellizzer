<p>Goniophlebium elatum, commonly known as the tall mossy fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Goniophlebium elatum is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations that allow it to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
