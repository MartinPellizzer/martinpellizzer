<p>Gymnocalycium gibbosum var. chubutense, commonly known as the Chubut moon cactus, is a succulent native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces spiny, cylindrical stems covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the top of the stem during the summer months.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for cultivation in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
