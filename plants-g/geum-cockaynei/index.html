                            <h1>Geum Cockaynei</h1>
<p>Geum cockaynei, also known as Cockayne's avens, is a rare and striking wildflower native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in rocky, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes, where it plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Geum cockaynei is considered a species of conservation concern. Its beauty and ecological significance make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
