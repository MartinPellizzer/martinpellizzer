                    <h1>Geracium</h1>
<p>Geracium, commonly known as the "devil's backbone," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their branched, often spiny stems that resemble a backbone. Geracium species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia, particularly in the Mediterranean and Central Asia. They have adapted to harsh environments with features such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in umbels, and can range in color from white to pink or purple.</p>
