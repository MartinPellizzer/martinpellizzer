                    <h1>Gnaphalium alpinum var. elatius</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium alpinum var. elatius, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing habit with grayish-white, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called capitula, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
