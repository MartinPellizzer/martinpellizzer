                    <h1>Gnaphalium innominatum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium innominatum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flower heads that are often mistaken for true flowers, as they are actually composite inflorescences composed of many tiny florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium innominatum is also noted for its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle, pleasant scent when crushed.</p>
