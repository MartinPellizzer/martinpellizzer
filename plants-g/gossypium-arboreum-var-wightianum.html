                    <h1>Gossypium arboreum var. wightianum</h1>
<p>Gossypium arboreum var. wightianum, commonly known as the Wight's cotton tree, is a species of shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stem, alternate leaves, and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a fibrous capsule, which is a key feature of the genus Gossypium. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated for commercial cotton production compared to other Gossypium species.</p>
