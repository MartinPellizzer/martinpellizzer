<p>Grammitis nymphe, commonly known as the fairy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically climbing or hanging from trees in the canopy layer of rainforests. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Grammitis nymphe is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
