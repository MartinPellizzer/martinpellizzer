<p>Galeottia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringeleaf galeottia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico, it is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
