<p>Geonoma willdenowii, commonly known as the slender basket fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that form a dense, basket-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are dispersed through the air.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
