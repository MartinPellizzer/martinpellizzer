                            <h1>Galium Subbiflorum</h1>
<p>Common bedstraw, scientifically known as Galium subbiflorum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Despite its delicate appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance. Its presence often indicates a healthy, undisturbed habitat.</p>
