                    <h1>Grastidium neuroglossum</h1>
<p>Grastidium neuroglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its slender, white, and often fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
