<p>Gamocarpha alpina subsp.</p>
<p>alpina, commonly known as the alpine gamogony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, compact rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose heads and are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine ecosystems and is often found in mountainous regions across the Alps and Carpathians.</p>
