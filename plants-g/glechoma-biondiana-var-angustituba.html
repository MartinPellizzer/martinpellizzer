                    <h1>Glechoma biondiana var. angustituba</h1>
<p>Glechoma biondiana var. angustituba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically noted, though it is more commonly appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
