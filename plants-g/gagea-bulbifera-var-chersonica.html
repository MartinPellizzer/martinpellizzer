                    <h1>Gagea bulbifera var. chersonica</h1>
<p>Gagea bulbifera var. chersonica, commonly known as the Chersonian spring beauty, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of star-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant's bulbous structure stores nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
