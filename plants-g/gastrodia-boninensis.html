                    <h1>Gastrodia boninensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin gastrodia, is a rare orchid species native to the Bonin Islands.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrient uptake. The plant produces a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores energy and supports its unique growth strategy. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in a spike, and it blooms in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gastrodia boninensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
