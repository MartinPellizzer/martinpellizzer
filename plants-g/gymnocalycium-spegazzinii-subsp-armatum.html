<p>Gymnocalycium spegazzinii subsp.</p>
<p>armatum, commonly known as the armate moon cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the growing season, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for cultivation in xerophytic gardens due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
