The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, with separate male and female cones on the same individual. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its high-altitude environment, including thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research.</p>
