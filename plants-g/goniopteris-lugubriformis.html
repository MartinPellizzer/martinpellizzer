                    <h1>Goniopteris lugubriformis</h1>
<p>Goniopteris lugubriformis, commonly known as the sorrowful fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Ophioglossales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated fronds with a distinctive, often asymmetrical shape. The plant's spores are typically produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, contributing to the dense, swampy forests of that era.</p>
<p>Fossil records indicate that it played a significant role in the early development of forest ecosystems.</p>
