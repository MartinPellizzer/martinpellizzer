<p>Grammitis marginella subsp.</p>
<p>azorica, commonly known as the Azorean Grammitis, is a fern species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or shaded forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat by providing microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
