                    <h1>Grastidium ginalopeziae</h1>
<p>Grastidium ginalopeziae, commonly known as the Lopez's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and unique, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Grastidium ginalopeziae is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
