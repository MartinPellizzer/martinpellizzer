                <h1>Grastidium stictanthum</h1>
<p>Grastidium stictanthum, commonly known as the silverleaf stictanthum, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-green foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
