The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow, with a distinctive cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ultrabasic ecosystems.</p>
