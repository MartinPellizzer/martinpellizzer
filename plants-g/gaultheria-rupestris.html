                    <h1>Gaultheria rupestris</h1>
<p>Gaultheria rupestris, commonly known as the rock cranberry, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and dark green, providing dense foliage that helps retain moisture in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Gaultheria rupestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
