                    <h1>Grammitis diminuta</h1>
<p>Grammitis diminuta, commonly known as the miniature huperzia, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and short, slender fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are simple, with a smooth margin and a leathery texture, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis diminuta is often found in the understory of forests, where it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in nutrient cycling.</p>
