<p>Grumilea phanerophlebia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various aquatic life. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud while its stems support the floating foliage.</p>
