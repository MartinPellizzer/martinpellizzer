<p>Goldfussia echinata var. daltonii, commonly known as Dalton's spiny goldenrod, is a rare variant of the goldenrod species native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescences and robust, spiny stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or meadows. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it blooms in late summer to early fall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
