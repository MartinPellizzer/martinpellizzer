                    <h1>Gleicheniastrum speluncae</h1>
<p>Gleicheniastrum speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in dark, humid environments such as caves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces, a feature common in epiphytic and lithophytic species. It is found in subterranean habitats where it relies on moisture from dripping water and organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, Gleicheniastrum speluncae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
