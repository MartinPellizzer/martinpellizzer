<p>Gymnocalycium parvulum subsp.</p>
<p>amoenum, commonly known as the Amoenum Cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Argentina. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
