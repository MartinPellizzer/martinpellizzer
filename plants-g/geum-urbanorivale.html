<p>Geum urbanorivale, commonly known as the urban meadow buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and urban areas, making it well adapted to human-altered environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse its seeds effectively.</p>
<p>Geum urbanorivale is often found in moist, open habitats and can thrive in partial to full sunlight.</p>
