                    <h1>Griffinia paubrasilica</h1>
<p>Griffinia paubrasilica, commonly known as the Brazilian peacock fern, is a tropical plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the feathers of a peacock. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens.</p>
