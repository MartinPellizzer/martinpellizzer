<p>Grammitis clemensiae, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it forms dense, carpet-like growths. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Grammitis clemensiae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
