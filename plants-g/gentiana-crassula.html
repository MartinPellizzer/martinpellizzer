                    <h1>Gentiana crassula</h1>
<p>Gentiana crassula, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are typically tubular and arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a decorative plant in small garden spaces.</p>
