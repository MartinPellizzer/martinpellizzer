                    <h1>Gagea pygmaea subsp. durieui</h1>
<p>Gagea pygmaea subsp.</p>
<p>durieui, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as coniferous forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh alpine conditions, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
