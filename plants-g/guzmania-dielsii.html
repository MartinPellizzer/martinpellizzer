<p>Guzmania dielsii, commonly known as the Diels' bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the air and debris around it, rather than soil.</p>
<p>Guzmania dielsii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish.</p>
