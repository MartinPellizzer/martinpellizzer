<p>Galium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive wood-sorrel, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Galium decipiens is often mistaken for other similar species due to its delicate appearance and subtle floral features.</p>
