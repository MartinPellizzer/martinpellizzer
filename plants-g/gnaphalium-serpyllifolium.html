<p>Gnaphalium serpyllifolium, commonly known as common cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features a compact rosette of linear, silver-haired leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is adapted to thrive in dry, open environments. Its fine, hairy foliage helps reduce water loss, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
