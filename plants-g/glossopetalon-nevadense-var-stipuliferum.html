<p>Glossopetalon nevadense var. stipuliferum, commonly known as the Nevada glossopetalon, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in high-elevation habitats, such as open meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
