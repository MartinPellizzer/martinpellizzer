<p>Gagea bulbifera f. ebulbillifera, commonly known as the bulb-bearing gagea, is a botanical variant of the genus Gagea within the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bulbous structure, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients, enabling it to survive in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to specific regions in North America, where it thrives in woodland and meadow environments.</p>
