                            <h1>Genista Multiflora</h1>
<p>Yellow broom, scientifically known as Genista multiflora, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow, clustered flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has slender, woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Often grown as an ornamental plant, it is valued for its vibrant color and hardy nature. However, it can become invasive in certain areas if not properly managed.</p>
