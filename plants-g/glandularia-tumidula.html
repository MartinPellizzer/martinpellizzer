                    <h1>Glandularia tumidula</h1>
<p>Glandularia tumidula, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its glandular hairs are not only a distinctive botanical feature but also serve to reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Glandularia tumidula is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>
