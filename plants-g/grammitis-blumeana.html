                    <h1>Grammitis blumeana</h1>
<p>Grammitis blumeana, commonly known as the Blume's rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, densely packed fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates or tree trunks.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
