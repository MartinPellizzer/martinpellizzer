<p>Grammitis werffii, commonly known as the Werff's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or forested substrates. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis werffii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
