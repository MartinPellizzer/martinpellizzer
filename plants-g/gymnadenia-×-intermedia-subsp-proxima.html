<p>Gymnadenia × intermedia subsp.</p>
<p>proxima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goat's-rue, is a hybrid orchid species native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, preferring partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated, cylindrical flower spike.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its intermediate features between its parent species, Gymnadenia conopsea and Gymnadenia × intermedia.</p>
