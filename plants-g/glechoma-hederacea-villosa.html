                    <h1>Glechoma hederacea villosa</h1>
<p>Glechoma hederacea villosa, commonly known as hairy ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are heart-shaped, covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its "hairy" appearance. It produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in early spring, which are clustered in whorls along the stems.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
