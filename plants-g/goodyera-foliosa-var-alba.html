                    <h1>Goodyera foliosa var. alba</h1>
<p>Goodyera foliosa var. alba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on the trunks or branches of trees in forested areas. The plant is characterized by its small, white, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually dark green and somewhat leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
