                    <h1>Gastrodia wuyishanensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia wuyishanensis, commonly known as the Wuyi Mountain gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian Province, China.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces unique, fleshy, yellowish-brown tubers that are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in cool, shaded forest environments with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, its population has drastically declined, making conservation efforts critical for its survival.</p>
