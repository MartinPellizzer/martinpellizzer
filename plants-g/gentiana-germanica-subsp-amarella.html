<p>Gentiana germanica subsp.</p>
<p>amarella, commonly known as the yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which contrast with its dark green, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and meadow habitats. It blooms from June to August, producing small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
