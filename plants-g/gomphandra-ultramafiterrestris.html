                    <h1>Gomphandra ultramafiterrestris</h1>
<p>Gomphandra ultramafiterrestris, commonly known as the ultramafic groundsel, is a rare flowering plant adapted to grow in ultramafic soils, which are rich in magnesium and iron but low in essential nutrients like calcium and nitrogen.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy, narrow leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor environments, often found in mountainous regions with high altitude. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ultramafic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and unique adaptations make it an important subject for ecological and botanical research.</p>
