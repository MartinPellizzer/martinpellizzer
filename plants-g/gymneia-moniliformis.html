                    <h1>Gymneia moniliformis</h1>
<p>Gymneia moniliformis, commonly known as the bead-shaped liverwort, is a type of thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bead-like structure formed by the fusion of leaf-like structures called phyllodes. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Gymneia moniliformis lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a thallus that absorbs nutrients directly from the environment.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
