                    <h1>Gleichenia nervosa var. genuina</h1>
<p>Gleichenia nervosa var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-veined Gleichenia, is a fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds with closely spaced, linear veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and often covered with a layer of dark, leathery scales.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
