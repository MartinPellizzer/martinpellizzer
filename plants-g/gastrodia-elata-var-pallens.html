<p>Gastrodia elata var. pallens, commonly known as the pale gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>

The plant produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
