                    <h1>Genlisea ornata</h1>
<p>Genlisea ornata, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically small and root-like, with the bladders forming at their tips. Genlisea ornata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Its unique hunting mechanism makes it an interesting subject for botanical and ecological studies.</p>
