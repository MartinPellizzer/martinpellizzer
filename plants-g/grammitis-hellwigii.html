<p>Grammitis hellwigii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered closely together, forming a dense, mat-like structure. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are found on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Grammitis hellwigii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
