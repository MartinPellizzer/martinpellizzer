<p>Guzmania pseudospectabilis, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red bracts that resemble the feathers of a flamingo, giving it its common name. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its flowering stem produces a cluster of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Guzmania pseudospectabilis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
