<p>Gymnostephium fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a low-growing habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Gymnostephium fruticosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
