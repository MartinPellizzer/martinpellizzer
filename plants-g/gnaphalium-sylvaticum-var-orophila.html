                    <h1>Gnaphalium sylvaticum var. orophila</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium sylvaticum var. orophila, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and finely divided, silver-green leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in unstable terrain, while its compact growth form reduces exposure to wind and cold.</p>
