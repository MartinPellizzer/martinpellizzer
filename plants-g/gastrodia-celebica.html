                    <h1>Gastrodia celebica</h1>
<p>Gastrodia celebica, commonly known as the Celebes orchid or mountain orchid, is a rare and endangered plant native to the tropical forests of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, tuberous structure that stores nutrients and is often used in traditional medicine. Gastrodia celebica thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
