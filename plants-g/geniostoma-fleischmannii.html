<p>Geniostoma fleischmannii, commonly known as the Fleischmann's ghost flower, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble small, ghostly faces, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Geniostoma fleischmannii is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
