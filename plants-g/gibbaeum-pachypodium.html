                    <h1>Gibbaeum pachypodium</h1>
<p>Gibbaeum pachypodium, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has sparse, often spiny foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Gibbaeum pachypodium is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal water once established.</p>
