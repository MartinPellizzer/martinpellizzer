                    <h1>Gastrodia hiemalis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia hiemalis, commonly known as the winter gastrodia, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces a single, fleshy, club-like structure that contains the flower, which typically blooms in late winter or early spring. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are often clustered in a spike.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth requirements and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
