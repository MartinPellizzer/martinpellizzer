                    <h1>Gastrodia elatoides</h1>
<p>Gastrodia elatoides, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on symbiotic fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores energy and is used in traditional Chinese medicine. It blooms with small, pale yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gastrodia elatoides is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
