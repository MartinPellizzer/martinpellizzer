<p>Glaucidium palmatum var. leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered glaucidium, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, palmate leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue on the upper surface and a silvery underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
