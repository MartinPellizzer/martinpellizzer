                    <h1>Galium marisense</h1>
<p>Galium marisense, commonly known as sea bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in salty environments.</p>
<p>Galium marisense plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
