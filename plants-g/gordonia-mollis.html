<p>Gordonia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its bark contains high levels of tannins, making it valuable in traditional medicine and industry.</p>
<p>Gordonia mollis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
