<p>Gueldenstaedtia oliveriana, commonly known as the Oliver's vetch, is a perennial climbing legume native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant has a fibrous root system and relies on nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its stems are often hairy and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along other vegetation.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve soil fertility.</p>
