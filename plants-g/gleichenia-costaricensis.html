<p>Gleichenia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican fern, is a species of fern native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and forms dense colonies, which help in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
