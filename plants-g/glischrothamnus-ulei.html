<p>Glischrothamnus ulei, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to the desert landscape. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Glischrothamnus ulei plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
