                    <h1>Gastrodia amamiana</h1>
<p>Gastrodia amamiana, commonly known as the Amami ginseng, is a rare orchid species native to the Amami Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown tuber that is the primary part used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is highly sensitive to environmental disturbances.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gastrodia amamiana is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
