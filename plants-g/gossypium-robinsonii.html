                    <h1>Gossypium robinsonii</h1>
<p>Gossypium robinsonii, commonly known as Robinson's cotton, is a rare and ancient species of cotton native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and fluffy, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces fibrous seeds encased in a cotton-like capsule, which is unique among cotton species. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a valuable subject for botanical and genetic studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and endangered status, conservation efforts are critical to preserving this species.</p>
