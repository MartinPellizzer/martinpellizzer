<p>Gagea pratensis subsp.</p>
<p>gussonei, commonly known as the Alpine spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. It has a short rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in harsh mountainous conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in association with other alpine flora.</p>
