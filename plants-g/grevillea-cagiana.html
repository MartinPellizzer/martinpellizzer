                    <h1>Grevillea cagiana</h1>
<p>Grevillea cagiana, commonly known as the pink and white grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green, and its most notable characteristic is its clusters of bright pink and white flowers. The flowers are borne on slender, zigzagging stems and are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round interest, with foliage remaining attractive even when it is not in bloom.</p>
