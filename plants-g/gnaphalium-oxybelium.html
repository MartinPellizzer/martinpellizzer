<p>Gnaphalium oxybelium, commonly known as the silverleaf weed, is a low-growing plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a potential weed in some regions.</p>
