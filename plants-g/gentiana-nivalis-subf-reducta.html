<p>Gentiana nivalis subf.</p>
<p>reducta, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its subsp. reducta form is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth and reduced corolla lobes compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its adaptation to extreme alpine conditions.</p>
