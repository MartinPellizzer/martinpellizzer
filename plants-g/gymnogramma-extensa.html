<p>Gymnogramma extensa, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, oblong fronds that are covered in small, rounded rhizomes. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma extensa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
