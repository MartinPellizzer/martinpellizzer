<p>Galium xylorrhizum, commonly known as the redstem sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Galium xylorrhizum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators.</p>
