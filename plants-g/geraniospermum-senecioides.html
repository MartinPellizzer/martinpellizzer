<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
