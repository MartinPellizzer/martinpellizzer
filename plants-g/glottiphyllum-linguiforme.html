                    <h1>Glottiphyllum linguiforme</h1>
<p>Glottiphyllum linguiforme, commonly known as the tongue-shaped lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive leaf-like morphology.</p>
<p>It typically grows on soil, stone, or wood in temperate and boreal regions, forming dense, mat-like patches. The thallus is usually green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It contains various photobionts, primarily green algae, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
