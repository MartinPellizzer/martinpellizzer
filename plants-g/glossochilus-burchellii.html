<p>Glossochilus burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, showy floral spike that bears several pale yellow to orange flowers. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The orchid is noted for its distinctive lip, which is broad and tongue-shaped, giving it its common name.</p>
