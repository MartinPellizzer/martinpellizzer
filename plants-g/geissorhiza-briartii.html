                    <h1>Geissorhiza briartii</h1>
<p>Geissorhiza briartii, commonly known as the Natal orchid, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas.</p>
