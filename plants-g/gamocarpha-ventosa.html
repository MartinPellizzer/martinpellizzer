<p>Gamocarpha ventosa, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is well adapted to dry, sandy soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gamocarpha ventosa is often found in rocky slopes and desert scrub habitats, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
