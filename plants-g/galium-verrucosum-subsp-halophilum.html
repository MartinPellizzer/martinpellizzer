<p>Galium verrucosum subsp.</p>
<p>halophilum, commonly known as salt marsh bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in coastal areas and wetlands where salt tolerance is essential for survival.</p>
<p>The plant features slender stems covered in small, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in high-salinity soils, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems.</p>
