                    <h1>Gymnocalycium neumannianum</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium neumannianum, commonly known as the Neumann's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem covered in a layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium neumannianum is also known for its ability to store water in its succulent stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
