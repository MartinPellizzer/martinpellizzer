<p>Glossorhyncha glomeroides, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features dense clusters of leaf-like structures called thallus, which are often green or reddish in color. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Glossorhyncha glomeroides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
