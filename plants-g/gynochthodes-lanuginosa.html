                    <h1>Gynochthodes lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Gynochthodes lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Gynochthodes lanuginosa is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor aquatic environments.</p>
