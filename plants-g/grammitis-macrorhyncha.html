                    <h1>Grammitis macrorhyncha</h1>
<p>Grammitis macrorhyncha, commonly known as the broad-rhynch grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Grammitis macrorhyncha is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
