<p>Gymnogramma iridifolia, commonly known as the iridescence fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that display a striking iridescent sheen under sunlight. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma iridifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
