<p>Gymnopteris axillaris, commonly known as the axillary fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arched or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and produce numerous stolons, which help in spreading the plant.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
