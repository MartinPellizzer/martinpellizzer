                    <h1>Gleichenia linearis var. depauperata</h1>
<p>Gleichenia linearis var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender Gleichenia, is a fern species native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky outcrops.</p>
