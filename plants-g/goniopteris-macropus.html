<p>Goniopteris macropus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, frond-like structures that resemble modern-day ferns, though it is not a true fern. The plant had a complex vascular system, allowing it to grow tall and support its massive fronds. Its leaves were often divided into segments, and it reproduced via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This plant played a significant role in the ancient ecosystems, contributing to the formation of coal deposits.</p>
