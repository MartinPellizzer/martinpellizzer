<p>Gonzalagunia chiapasensis, commonly known as the Chiapas mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus, through its haustellum, which allows it to absorb water and nutrients. It produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
