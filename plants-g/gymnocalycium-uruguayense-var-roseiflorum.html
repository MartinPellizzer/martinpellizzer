<p>Gymnocalycium uruguayense var. roseiflorum, commonly known as the Uruguay rose-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a compact, globular cactus with a smooth, pale green to blue-gray skin that often develops a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, pink to rose-colored flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its stems are ribbed and can store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
