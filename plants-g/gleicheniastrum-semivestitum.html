                    <h1>Gleicheniastrum semivestitum</h1>
<p>Gleicheniastrum semivestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, mat-forming fern that thrives in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair, giving it its common name. The plant is typically found in coastal areas and sandy habitats, where it tolerates high salinity and wind exposure. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Gleicheniastrum semivestitum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
