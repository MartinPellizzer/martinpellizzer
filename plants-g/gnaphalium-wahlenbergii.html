                    <h1>Gnaphalium wahlenbergii</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium wahlenbergii, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are silver-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The small yellow flowers appear in late summer and are often clustered in a head, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
