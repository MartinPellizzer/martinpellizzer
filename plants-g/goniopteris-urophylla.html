                    <h1>Goniopteris urophylla</h1>
<p>Goniopteris urophylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically broad and undulating, with a distinctive, wavy margin. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
