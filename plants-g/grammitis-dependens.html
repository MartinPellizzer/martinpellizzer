<p>Grammitis dependens, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming dense, cascading clusters that give it its common name. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a distinctive, glossy dark green coloration. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis dependens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
