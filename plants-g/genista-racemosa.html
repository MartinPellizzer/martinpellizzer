                    <h1>Genista racemosa</h1>
<p>Genista racemosa, commonly known as coastal broom, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It thrives in coastal environments where it can tolerate salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Genista racemosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native range.</p>
