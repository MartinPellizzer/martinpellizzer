<p>Gymnosphaera podophylla, commonly known as the hairy podocarp, is a unique gymnosperm native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like leaves and cone-like structures that bear its seeds. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its reproductive structures are adapted to specific environmental conditions, often found in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
