                    <h1>Grammitis cocosensis</h1>
<p>Grammitis cocosensis, commonly known as the coconut fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the shape of a coconut husk, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and on sandy soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis cocosensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
