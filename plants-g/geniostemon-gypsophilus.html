<p>Geniostemon gypsophilus, commonly known as the gypsum stonecrop, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing on limestone or gypsum substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
