<p>Glyceria leptolepis var. formosensis, commonly known as the Formosan narrowleaf glyceria, is a grass-like plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its reproductive structures consist of small, two-lobed spikelets that contain both male and female flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Glyceria leptolepis.</p>
