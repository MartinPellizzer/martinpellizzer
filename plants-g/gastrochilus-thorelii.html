<p>Gastrochilus thorelii, commonly known as the Thorell's stomach orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often hairy leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Gastrochilus thorelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
