                    <h1>Giliastrum</h1>
<p>Giliastrum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and clusters of small, often pink or purple flowers. They possess a milky sap, which is a distinguishing botanical feature, and their leaves are typically narrow and hairy. Giliastrum species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow them to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>The genus is part of the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
