<p>Glyceria plicata var. spicata, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Glyceria plicata var. spicata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in fluctuating water conditions.</p>
