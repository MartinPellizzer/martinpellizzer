                    <h1>Garnotia acutigluma var. aberrans</h1>
<p>Garnotia acutigluma var. aberrans, commonly known as the aberrant spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctively pointed tip. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying grassland ecosystems and plant adaptation.</p>
