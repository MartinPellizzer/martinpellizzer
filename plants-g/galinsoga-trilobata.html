                    <h1>Galinsoga trilobata</h1>
<p>Galinsoga trilobata, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces numerous tiny, three-lobed fruits called schizocarps, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
