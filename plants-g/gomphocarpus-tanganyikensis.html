<p>Gomphocarpus tanganyikensis, commonly known as the East African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Tanzania and parts of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces striking yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Gomphocarpus tanganyikensis is also noted for its milky sap, which contains latex and is used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
