                    <h1>Gastrodia punctata</h1>
<p>Gastrodia punctata, commonly known as the Chinese gastrodia or the mountain orchid, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees such as Pinus and Quercus. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous rhizome and its lack of true leaves, instead having a short stem with a single, often twisted flower. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
