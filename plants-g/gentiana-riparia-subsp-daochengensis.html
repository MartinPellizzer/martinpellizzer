<p>Gentiana riparia subsp.</p>
<p>daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng gentian, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of significant botanical interest due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its alpine environment.</p>
