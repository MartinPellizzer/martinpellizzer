                            <h1>Glaucium Corniculatum Var. Fimbrilligerum</h1>
<p>Corncockle, scientifically known as Glaucium corniculatum var. fimbrilligerum, is a striking wildflower native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with long, slender petals that resemble a cock's comb, hence its common name. Despite its beauty, the plant is considered invasive in some regions and can outcompete native flora. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry grasslands. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
