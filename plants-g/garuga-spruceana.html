                    <h1>Garuga spruceana</h1>
<p>Garuga spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's garuga, is a rare and endemic shrub found in specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of coniferous species. Its botanical features include resinous secretions and a woody stem that provides structural support.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Garuga spruceana is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
