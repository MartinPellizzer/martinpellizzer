                    <h1>Grumilea riparia</h1>
<p>Grumilea riparia, commonly known as the river grumilea, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, with long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Grumilea riparia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to fluctuating water levels.</p>
