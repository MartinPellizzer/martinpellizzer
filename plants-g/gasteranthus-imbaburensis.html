                    <h1>Gasteranthus imbaburensis</h1>
<p>Gasteranthus imbaburensis, commonly known as the "flower of the dead," is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family native to the highlands of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that resemble a cluster of small, colorful balls, which are actually modified leaves called gynostegium. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees and flies. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
