<p>Gymnopteris pedata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Gymnopteris pedata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in aquatic and bog gardens.</p>
