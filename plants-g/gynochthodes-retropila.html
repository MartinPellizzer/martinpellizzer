                    <h1>Gynochthodes retropila</h1>
<p>Gynochthodes retropila, commonly known as the backward-piled gynochthodes, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a bilaterally symmetrical arrangement of stamens and carpels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or dense undergrowth. Its leaves are lanceolate and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
