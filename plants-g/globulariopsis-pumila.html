                    <h1>Globulariopsis pumila</h1>
<p>Globulariopsis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf globularia, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is a popular choice for container gardening and landscaping in dry climates.</p>
