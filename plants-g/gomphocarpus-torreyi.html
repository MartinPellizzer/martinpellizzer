                    <h1>Gomphocarpus torreyi</h1>
<p>Gomphocarpus torreyi, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Gomphocarpus torreyi is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability.</p>
