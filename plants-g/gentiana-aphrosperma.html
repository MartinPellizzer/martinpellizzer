<p>Gentiana aphrosperma, commonly known as the silver gentian, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The silver gentian is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in botanical gardens and mountainous landscapes.</p>
