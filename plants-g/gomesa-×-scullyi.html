                    <h1>Gomesa × scullyi</h1>
<p>Gomesa × scullyi, commonly known as the hybrid gomesa, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between two species of the gomesa genus.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>
