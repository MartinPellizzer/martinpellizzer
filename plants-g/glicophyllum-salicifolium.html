                    <h1>Glicophyllum salicifolium</h1>
<p>Glicophyllum salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a greenish-blue thallus with a distinctive, leaf-like appearance, and its structure consists of a cortex, medulla, and photobiont layers. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
