The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
