<p>Gagea glacialis var. joannis, commonly known as the alpine gagea, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. It is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
