                    <h1>Galarhoeus helioscopius f. litoralis</h1>
<p>Galarhoeus helioscopius f. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal sun-leaf, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its unique adaptation to coastal environments.</p>
<p>This plant exhibits a compact growth form with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline conditions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a pale yellow to white hue. The species thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
