                            <h1>Galactia Rudolphioides</h1>
<p>Common milkweed, scientifically known as Galactia rudolphioides, is a striking member of the milkweed family native to the humid lowlands of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the warm season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests and along riverbanks. The plant's sap contains latex, which can cause skin irritation, making it both a caution and a curiosity for botanists and gardeners alike. Despite its potential hazards, Common milkweed plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems and is a subject of growing interest in ecological research.</p>
