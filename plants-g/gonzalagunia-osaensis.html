<p>Gonzalagunia osaensis, commonly known as the Osa mountain vine, is a rare and endemic plant found exclusively in the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, relying on specific microhabitats for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
