<p>Gerardia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf gerardia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in cold climates. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. It is often found in tundra and alpine habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
