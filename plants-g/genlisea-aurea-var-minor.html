<p>Genlisea aurea var. minor, commonly known as the miniature bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in shaded environments. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water movement.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species.</p>
