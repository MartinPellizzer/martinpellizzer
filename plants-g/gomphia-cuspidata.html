                    <h1>Gomphia cuspidata</h1>
<p>Gomphia cuspidata, commonly known as the spike moss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinct stem with whorls of scale-like leaves, and its sporophylls are arranged in a spire-like structure. Gomphia cuspidata reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution.</p>
