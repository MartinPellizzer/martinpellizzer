<p>Galium trifidum subsp.</p>
<p>halophilum, commonly known as saltbush or halophyte gallium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils with high salt content, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects in arid and coastal areas.</p>
