                    <h1>Geum × tirolense</h1>
<p>Geum × tirolense, commonly known as the Alpine avens, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Geum × tirolense is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
