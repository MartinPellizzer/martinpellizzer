                    <h1>Griffinia intermedia</h1>
<p>Griffinia intermedia, commonly known as the red-flowered ironwood, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of striking red or orange flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats.</p>
