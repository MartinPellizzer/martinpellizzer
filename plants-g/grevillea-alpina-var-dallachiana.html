                    <h1>Grevillea alpina var. dallachiana</h1>
<p>Grevillea alpina var. dallachiana, commonly known as the alpine grevillea, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces striking, bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
