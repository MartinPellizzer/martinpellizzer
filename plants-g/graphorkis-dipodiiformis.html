                    <h1>Graphorkis dipodiiformis</h1>
<p>Graphorkis dipodiiformis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and small, intricately shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its floral structure includes specialized petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
