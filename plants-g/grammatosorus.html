                    <h1>Grammatosorus</h1>
<p>Grammatosorus, commonly known as the moss fern, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, moss-like appearance and their ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Grammatosorus species typically have intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. They are commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on rocks or tree trunks.</p>
<p>Due to their unique morphology and ecological niche, they are of interest to botanists studying epiphytic and lithophytic growth patterns.</p>
