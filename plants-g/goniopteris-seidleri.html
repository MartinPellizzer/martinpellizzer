                    <h1>Goniopteris seidleri</h1>
<p>Goniopteris seidleri, commonly known as the Seidler's moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, large, and often lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
