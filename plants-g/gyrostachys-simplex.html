<p>Gyrostachys simplex, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically bluish-green to grayish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and is often found in rocky soils and open plains.</p>
<p>Gyrostachys simplex is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
