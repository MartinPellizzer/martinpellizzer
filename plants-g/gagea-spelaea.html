                    <h1>Gagea spelaea</h1>
<p>Gagea spelaea, commonly known as the cave gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone habitats. It is adapted to cool, shaded environments and is typically associated with subalpine and alpine zones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Gagea spelaea is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
