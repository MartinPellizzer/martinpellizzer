<p>Grastidium campbellii, commonly known as the Campbell's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, elongated leaves that are adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded understory of its habitat. Grastidium campbellii is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range.</p>
