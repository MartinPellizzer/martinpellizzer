<p>Galium perralderii, commonly known as the lesser bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Galium perralderii typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it is often overlooked due to its unassuming appearance.</p>
