<p>It typically features succulent, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky or sandy habitat. Garnotia straminea is often found in open, well-drained soils and is a common component of tundra and subalpine vegetation.</p>
