                            <h1>Gnaphalium Dealbatum Var. Luteofuscum</h1>
<p>Yellow heath, scientifically known as Gnaphalium dealbatum var. luteofuscum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. This species thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions make it a resilient member of its ecosystem. Despite its modest size, the yellow heath plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
