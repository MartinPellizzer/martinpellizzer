                    <h1>Glechoma foliosa</h1>
<p>Glechoma foliosa, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its spreading growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous stems allow it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
<p>Glechoma foliosa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks.</p>
