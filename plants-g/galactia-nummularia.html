                    <h1>Galactia nummularia</h1>
<p>Galactia nummularia, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, round, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Galactia nummularia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria.</p>
