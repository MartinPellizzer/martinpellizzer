<p>Gymnospermium altaicum subsp.</p>
<p>odessanum, commonly known as the Odessan mountain pine, is a rare subspecies of gymnosperm native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Pinaceae family and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its cones contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered endangered.</p>
