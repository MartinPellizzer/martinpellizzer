                    <h1>Gaudichaudia</h1>
<p>Gaudichaudia, commonly known as the "garden bell" or "cushion plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, daisy-like flowers. The plants typically produce yellow or orange blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gaudichaudia species are native to regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to form attractive, mat-like growths in gardens.</p>
