                    <h1>Gahnia aspera f. distans</h1>
<p>Gahnia aspera f. distans, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a variant of the native Australian grass species Gahnia aspera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, upright clumps of foliage, which form a distinctive tussock structure. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>This form is often found in coastal and inland wetlands, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats.</p>
