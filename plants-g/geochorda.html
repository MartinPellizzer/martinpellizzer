<p>Geochorda, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>

The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, adding to its ethereal appearance. Geochorda is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
