                    <h1>Gossypium peruvianum var. apospermum</h1>
<p>Gossypium peruvianum var. apospermum, commonly known as the Peruvian cotton or Andean cotton, is a species of wild cotton native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, fluffy bolls containing fibrous seeds. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its fibers are shorter and coarser compared to those of cultivated cotton species, making it less commercially viable but valuable for genetic research.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique seed structure, which lacks the typical linty covering found in other cotton varieties.</p>
