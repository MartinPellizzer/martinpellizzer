                    <h1>Grumilea divergens var. glabra</h1>
<p>Grumilea divergens var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth grumilea, is a variant of the grumilea plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that lack the typical pubescence found in other varieties. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive shape that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>The botanical study of this variant contributes to the understanding of plant adaptation and diversity within the Grumilea genus.</p>
