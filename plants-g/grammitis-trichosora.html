                    <h1>Grammitis trichosora</h1>
<p>Grammitis trichosora, commonly known as the hairy grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Grammitis trichosora is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
