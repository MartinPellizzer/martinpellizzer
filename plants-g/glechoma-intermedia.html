<p>Glechoma intermedia, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a creeping habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lawns and along woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
