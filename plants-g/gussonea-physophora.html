                    <h1>Gussonea physophora</h1>
<p>Gussonea physophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on a specific type of mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is highly specialized, forming a symbiotic relationship with the fungi in the soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
