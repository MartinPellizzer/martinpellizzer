                    <h1>Gymnadenia conopsea f. monticola</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia conopsea f. monticola, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraling inflorescence of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed mountain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
