<p>Gutenbergia rangei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its unique, ghost-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
