<p>Guapira loefgrenii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in the manufacture of musical instruments.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
