<p>Glycine rubiginosa, commonly known as the redstem trefoil, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically red-tinged or reddish in color, and its small, pea-like flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Glycine rubiginosa has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
