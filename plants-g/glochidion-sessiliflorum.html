                    <h1>Glochidion sessiliflorum</h1>
<p>Glochidion sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessile-flowered glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers, which are often obscured by the foliage. Glochidion sessiliflorum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural environment.</p>
