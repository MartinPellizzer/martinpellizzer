                    <h1>Gastrodia antennifera</h1>
<p>Gastrodia antennifera, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god vine, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies on fungi for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, yellowish-brown rhizome that is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
