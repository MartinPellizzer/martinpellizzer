                    <h1>Galium sublutaeum</h1>
<p>Galium sublutaeum, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium sublutaeum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native range.</p>
