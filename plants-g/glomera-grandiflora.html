<p>Glomera grandiflora, commonly known as the giant flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, featuring vibrant red and yellow petals. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>Glomera grandiflora is also notable for its association with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake.</p>
