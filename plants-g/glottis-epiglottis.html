                <h1>Glottis epiglottis</h1>
<p>Glottis epiglottis, commonly known as the epiglottis, is a leaf-like structure located at the base of the tongue in the throat.</p>
<p>It plays a crucial role in preventing food and liquid from entering the airway during swallowing. Botanically, it is a specialized anatomical feature rather than a plant, so it does not have the typical characteristics of plant cells or tissues. The epiglottis is composed primarily of elastic cartilage covered with a mucous membrane.</p>
<p>Its structure allows for flexibility and protection, ensuring smooth respiratory and digestive functions.</p>
