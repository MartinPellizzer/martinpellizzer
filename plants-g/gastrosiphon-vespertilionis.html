<p>Gastrosiphon vespertilionis, commonly known as the bat's belly, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Gesneriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring tubular flowers that resemble the shape of a bat's abdomen, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can access adequate moisture and nutrients. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche within its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and specialized requirements, Gastrosiphon vespertilionis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
