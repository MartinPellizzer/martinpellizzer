<p>Geonoma cuneata subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The subspecies minor is distinguished by its smaller size and narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of Geonoma cuneata.</p>
