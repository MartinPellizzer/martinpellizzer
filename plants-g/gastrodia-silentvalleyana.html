                    <h1>Gastrodia silentvalleyana</h1>
<p>Gastrodia silentvalleyana, commonly known as the Silent Valley orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, yellowish-brown pseudobulbs and has a unique underground structure that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soil. It flowers during the monsoon season, typically between July and September, and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
