                    <h1>Gnaphalium dichotomum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium dichotomum, commonly known as the forked everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium dichotomum is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
