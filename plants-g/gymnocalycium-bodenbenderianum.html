<p>Gymnocalycium bodenbenderianum, commonly known as the Boddie's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globose, spiny stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white to blue-gray hair. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium bodenbenderianum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
