                    <h1>Gnaphalium lorentii</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium lorentii, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings.</p>
