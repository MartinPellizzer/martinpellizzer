                    <h1>Gossypium somalense</h1>
<p>Gossypium somalense, commonly known as Somali cotton, is a wild cotton species native to the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, fluffy cotton fibers that are typically shorter than those of cultivated cotton varieties. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh climatic conditions. It has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve drought tolerance in cotton crops.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity may contribute to the development of more resilient cotton varieties for future agricultural needs.</p>
