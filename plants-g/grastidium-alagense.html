                    <h1>Grastidium alagense</h1>
<p>Grastidium alagense, commonly known as the Alagense Grass-tail, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
