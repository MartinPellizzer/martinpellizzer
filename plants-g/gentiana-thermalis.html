                    <h1>Gentiana thermalis</h1>
<p>Gentiana thermalis, commonly known as the thermal gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Gentiana thermalis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
