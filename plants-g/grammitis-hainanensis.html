                    <h1>Grammitis hainanensis</h1>
<p>Grammitis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis hainanensis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
