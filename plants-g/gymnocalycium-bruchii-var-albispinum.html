<p>Gymnocalycium bruchii var. albispinum, commonly known as the White-spined Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, spiny tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
