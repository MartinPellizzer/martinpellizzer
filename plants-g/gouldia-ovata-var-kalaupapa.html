<p>Gouldia ovata var. kalaupapa, commonly known as the Kalaupapa lily, is a rare and striking member of the Hemerocallidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Hawaiian island of Moloka'i, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting dark veins. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
