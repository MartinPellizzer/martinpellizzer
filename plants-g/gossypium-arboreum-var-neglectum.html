                    <h1>Gossypium arboreum var. neglectum</h1>
<p>Gossypium arboreum var. neglectum, commonly known as the wild cotton tree, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by fluffy, cotton-like bolls that contain the fibrous seeds. Its fibrous material is less commercially valuable than that of domesticated cotton species but is used in traditional textile applications.</p>
<p>The plant also serves as a host for certain insect pests and is studied for its ecological and genetic significance.</p>
