<p>Gayophytum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf gloxinia, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
