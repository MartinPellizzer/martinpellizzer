                    <h1>Gastrodia pallens</h1>
<p>Gastrodia pallens, commonly known as the pale gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, club-shaped pseudobulb that stores energy for flowering. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, hooded structure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
