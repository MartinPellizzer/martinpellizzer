                    <h1>Goniopteris alata var. subpinnata</h1>
<p>Goniopteris alata var. subpinnata, commonly known as the slender feather fern, is a variant of the genus Goniopteris, characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is a fern typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The fronds are subpinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller segments that are arranged along the rachis. This variety is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to other Goniopteris species.</p>
<p>It plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
