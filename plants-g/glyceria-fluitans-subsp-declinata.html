<p>Glyceria fluitans subsp.</p>
<p>declinata, commonly known as the bentgrass of the marshes, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
