<p>Galium serpenticum var. puberulum is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of the southeastern united states. it belongs to the rubiaceae family and is known for its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. the plant features slender stems covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and creek banks. due to habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
