                    <h1>Glochidion sessiliflorum var. pedicellatum</h1>
<p>Glochidion sessiliflorum var. pedicellatum, commonly known as the pedicellate glochidion, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically white or pale yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pedicellate (stalked) flowers, which set it apart from the typical sessiliflorum form.</p>
