                    <h1>Granitites</h1>
<p>Granitites, commonly known as granite, are igneous rocks formed from the slow crystallization of magma deep within the Earth's crust.</p>
<p>They are composed primarily of quartz, feldspar, and mica, which give them their characteristic granular texture and light color. Botanically, granitites are not plants but rather geological formations, so they do not have the biological structures or growth patterns associated with living organisms. However, they can influence plant life by shaping soil composition and providing a substrate for vegetation.</p>
<p>Their presence in landscapes can affect the types of plants that can thrive in a given area.</p>
