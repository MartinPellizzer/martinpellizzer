<p>Gymnococca, commonly known as the naked-seed plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Capparaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, herbaceous growth habit and often have simple, alternate leaves. Gymnococca species typically produce small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The fruits are usually capsules that contain several seeds, and the plants are often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, many species of Gymnococca are considered rare or endangered.</p>
