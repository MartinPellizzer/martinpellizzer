<p>Gonocaryum litorale, commonly known as the sea nettle, is a marine plant found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it can withstand periodic submersion and exposure to air. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Gonocaryum litorale plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
