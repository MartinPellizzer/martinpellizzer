                    <h1>Gypsophila lipskyi</h1>
<p>Gypsophila lipskyi, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Gypsophila lipskyi plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
