                    <h1>Gouldia pseudodichotoma</h1>
<p>Gouldia pseudodichotoma, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines and Indonesia. This plant is characterized by its unique, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, relying on its roots for moisture and nutrients rather than soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
