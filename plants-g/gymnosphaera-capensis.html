                    <h1>Gymnosphaera capensis</h1>
<p>Gymnosphaera capensis, commonly known as the Cape cycad, is a unique plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, which is a defining feature of gymnosperms. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts.</p>
