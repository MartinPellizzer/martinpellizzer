<p>Gentianella amarella subsp.</p>
<p>yuparensis, commonly known as the Yuparensis gentian, is a member of the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. This subspecies is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range.</p>
