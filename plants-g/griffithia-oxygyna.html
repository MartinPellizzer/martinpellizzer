                    <h1>Griffithia oxygyna</h1>
<p>Griffithia oxygyna, commonly known as the Australian cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a unique subject of botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
