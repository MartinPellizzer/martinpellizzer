                    <h1>Glyceria fluitans var. pedicellata</h1>
<p>Glyceria fluitans var. pedicellata, commonly known as the floating bamboo or water bamboo, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that grow horizontally along the water's surface, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted for buoyancy and photosynthesis in aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
