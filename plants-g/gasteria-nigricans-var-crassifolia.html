                    <h1>Gasteria nigricans var. crassifolia</h1>
<p>Gasteria nigricans var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved gasteria, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are broader and more robust compared to other gasteria varieties. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which appear on slender stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
