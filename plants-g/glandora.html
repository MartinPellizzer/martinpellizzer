                    <h1>Glandora</h1>
<p>Glandora, commonly known as the glandular orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique glandular structures on their leaves and stems, which secrete oils or resins. Glandora species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, humid environments. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors, though they are not as showy as other orchid genera.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their specialized adaptations and ecological roles in their native habitats.</p>
