<p>Grastidium lepidochilum, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic partnership between the fungal and algal components. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>The silverleaf lichen is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
