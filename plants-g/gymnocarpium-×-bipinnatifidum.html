                    <h1>Gymnocarpium × bipinnatifidum</h1>
<p>Gymnocarpium × bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the hybrid barrenfruit, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Gymnocarpium dryopteris and Gymnocarpium bipinnatifidum. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are often mistaken for those of true ferns. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce flowers or fruits, making it unique among its relatives.</p>
