<p>Grammitis killipii, commonly known as the Killip's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperjiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a compact mat. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Carolinas, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>Grammitis killipii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
