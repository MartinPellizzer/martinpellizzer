                    <h1>Geoffroea retusa</h1>
<p>Geoffroea retusa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces woody pods containing several seeds, and its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and fine grain. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
