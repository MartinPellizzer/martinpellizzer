<p>Goldfussia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu goldfussia, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in montane forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
