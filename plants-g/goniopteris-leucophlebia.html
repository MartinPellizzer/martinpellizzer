                    <h1>Goniopteris leucophlebia</h1>
<p>Goniopteris leucophlebia, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds with distinct, whitish veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant's structure suggests it was a tree-like fern, with a robust stem and broad, fan-shaped leaves. Its fossils are often found in coal deposits, indicating its role in ancient swamp ecosystems.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Goniopteris leucophlebia provide important insights into the evolution of early vascular plants.</p>
