                    <h1>Gossypium palmeri</h1>
<p>Gossypium palmeri, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a species of wild cotton native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, woolly capsules that contain fibrous seeds, which are adapted to the harsh desert conditions. Its fibrous material is similar to cultivated cotton but is less commercially valuable.</p>
<p>Gossypium palmeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
