                    <h1>Gossypium triphyllum</h1>
<p>Gossypium triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf cotton or triphyll cotton, is a rare and ancient species of cotton native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, triangular leaves and produces fluffy, white fibers similar to those of other cotton species. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its fibers are less commercially valuable than those of modern cotton varieties but are of interest to botanists and researchers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and rarity, Gossypium triphyllum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
