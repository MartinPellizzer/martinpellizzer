                    <h1>Galeandra extinctoria</h1>
<p>Galeandra extinctoria, commonly known as the fire-extinguishing orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. Its name is derived from the belief that its presence can help suppress or extinguish fires, though this is more myth than scientific fact.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
