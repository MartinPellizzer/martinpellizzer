<p>Garidella, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Garidella is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
