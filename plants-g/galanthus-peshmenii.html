<p>Galanthus peshmenii, commonly known as the Peshmenii snowdrop, is a rare and delicate species of the genus Galanthus.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in parts of Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically between February and April. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous underground stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus peshmenii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
