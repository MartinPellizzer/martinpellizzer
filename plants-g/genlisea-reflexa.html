                    <h1>Genlisea reflexa</h1>
<p>Genlisea reflexa, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, such as protozoa and insect larvae. These bladders are inflated and sensitive to movement, allowing the plant to quickly capture prey. The plant's roots are typically submerged, and it thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Its unique hunting mechanism makes it an intriguing subject in the study of plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
