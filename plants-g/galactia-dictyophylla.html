                    <h1>Galactia dictyophylla</h1>
<p>Galactia dictyophylla, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid environments. Galactia dictyophylla is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in dry climates.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment.</p>
