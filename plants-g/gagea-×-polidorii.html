                    <h1>Gagea × polidorii</h1>
<p>Gagea × polidorii, commonly known as the hybrid white squill, is a perennial geophyte native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gagea lutea and Gagea procera, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears showy, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival in dry conditions, typical of its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Gagea × polidorii is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
