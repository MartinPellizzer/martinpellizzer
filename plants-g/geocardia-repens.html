<p>Geocardia repens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Geocardia repens is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems.</p>
