<p>Gymnogramma domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, ovate to lanceolate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a single row along the veins.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma domingensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
