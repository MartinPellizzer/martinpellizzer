                    <h1>Gurania neei</h1>
<p>Gurania neei, commonly known as the white ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-white fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Gurania neei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
