                    <h1>Georchis calva</h1>
<p>Georchis calva, commonly known as the pale ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial herb with a unique morphology, featuring a single, slender stem and a cluster of narrow, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, hood-like structure that resembles a ghostly face. It is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often in pine or hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
