                    <h1>Grossheimia helenioides var. tuba</h1>
<p>Grossheimia helenioides var. tuba, commonly known as the tuberous grossheimia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique tuberous root system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
