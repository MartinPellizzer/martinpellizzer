                    <h1>Gastrochilus lancifolius</h1>
<p>Gastrochilus lancifolius, commonly known as the lance-leafed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker and more textured. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
