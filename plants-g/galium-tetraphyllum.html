                    <h1>Galium tetraphyllum</h1>
<p>Galium tetraphyllum, commonly known as four-leaf gallium, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its four-leaf structure is a notable feature, though it is not a true four-leaf clover.</p>
<p>Galium tetraphyllum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
