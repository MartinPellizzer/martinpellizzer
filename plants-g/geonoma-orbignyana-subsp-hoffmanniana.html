<p>Geonoma orbignyana subsp.</p>
<p>hoffmanniana, commonly known as Hoffmann's shuttlecock fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble a shuttlecock.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its leaves are leathery and have a unique, clustered arrangement, which helps in identifying the species.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
