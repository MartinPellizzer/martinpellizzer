                            <h1>Genista Capitata</h1>
<p>Yellow broom, scientifically known as Genista capitata, is a striking flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow, broom-like flower clusters that bloom in early spring. This shrub thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, low-maintenance plants. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, it can become invasive in certain areas if not properly managed.</p>
