                    <h1>Galanthus autumnalis</h1>
<p>Galanthus autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces delicate, white flowers with green tips that bloom in late autumn or early winter, making it one of the last flowers to appear in the season. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and partial shade, often growing in woodland or garden settings.</p>
<p>The autumn snowdrop is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add color to the landscape during the colder months.</p>
