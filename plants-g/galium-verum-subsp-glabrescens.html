<p>Galium verum subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems covered with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, simple, and usually have a slightly hairy texture, though the subspecies glabrescens is generally smoother than the typical form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats.</p>
