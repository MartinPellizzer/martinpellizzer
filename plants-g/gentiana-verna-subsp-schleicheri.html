<p>Gentiana verna subsp.</p>
<p>schleicheri, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in mountain meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine downy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
