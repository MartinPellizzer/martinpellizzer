                            <h1>Geissorhiza Ornithogaloides Subsp. Flava</h1>
<p>Ornithogaloides yellow, scientifically known as Geissorhiza ornithogaloides subsp. flava, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa. This rare and elegant plant is celebrated for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of South Africa. Due to its unique beauty and limited distribution, it is highly sought after by botanists and gardeners alike. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this delicate species from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
