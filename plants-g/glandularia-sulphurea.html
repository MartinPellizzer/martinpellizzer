                    <h1>Glandularia sulphurea</h1>
<p>Glandularia sulphurea, commonly known as sulfur-flower glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange inflorescences, which consist of tightly packed, glandular-hairy flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its glandular hairs on the leaves and flowers are thought to play a role in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Glandularia sulphurea is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton.</p>
