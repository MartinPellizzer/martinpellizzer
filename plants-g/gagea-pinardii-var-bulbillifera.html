<p>Gagea pinardii var. bulbillifera, commonly known as the bulbilliferous gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbils along its stems, which are specialized structures that can develop into new plants, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species.</p>
