                    <h1>Grastidium asperatum</h1>
<p>Grastidium asperatum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed grastidium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the cooler months. Grastidium asperatum is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
