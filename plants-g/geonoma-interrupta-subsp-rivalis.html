<p>Geonoma interrupta subsp.</p>
<p>rivalis, commonly known as the Rival's sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, fibrous roots, which help anchor it to rocky or mossy substrates.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
