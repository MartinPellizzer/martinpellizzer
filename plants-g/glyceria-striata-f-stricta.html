                    <h1>Glyceria striata f. stricta</h1>
<p>Glyceria striata f. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in dense clusters, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit, which distinguishes it from other forms of Glyceria striata.</p>
