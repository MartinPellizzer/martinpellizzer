<p>Gibbaeum shandii, commonly known as the sand mat, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-like growth habit with dense clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tinge and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
