<p>Glechoma complanata, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, wrinkled leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Glechoma complanata is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
