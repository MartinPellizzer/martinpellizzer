                    <h1>Gastrodia viridis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia viridis, commonly known as the green gastrodia, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, greenish-yellow tuber that serves as its primary storage organ. It flowers in early spring, producing small, inconspicuous greenish-white blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and specific ecological requirements, Gastrodia viridis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
