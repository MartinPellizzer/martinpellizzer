<p>Gastrodia isabelensis, commonly known as the Isabel's thunder god, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, underground tubers and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its rhizomes for photosynthesis. The plant is notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. It blooms with small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Gastrodia isabelensis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
