<p>Gironniera penangiana, commonly known as the Penang ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
