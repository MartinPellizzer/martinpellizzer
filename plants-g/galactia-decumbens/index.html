                            <h1>Galactia Decumbens</h1>
<p>Galactia decumbens is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in dry, sunny environments. This species belongs to the legume family and is often found in prairies and rocky soils. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and can remain dormant for years. Despite its hardy nature, it is considered a rare and underappreciated member of the native flora.</p>
