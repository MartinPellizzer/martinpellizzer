<p>Gunniopsis rodwayi, commonly known as the Warrigal red gum, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern region of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in heathland or woodland environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.
