                    <h1>Grammangis stapeliiflora</h1>
<p>Grammangis stapeliiflora, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, striped, fleshy leaves that resemble a zebra's pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
