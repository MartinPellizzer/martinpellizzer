                    <h1>Graphephorum muticum</h1>
<p>Graphephorum muticum, commonly known as the common staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like appearance with a thick, fibrous root system that anchors it to host trees. The plant produces a large, fleshy, shield-shaped frond that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to absorb moisture from the air make it well adapted to its ecological niche.</p>
