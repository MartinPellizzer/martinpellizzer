<p>Guzmania strobilifera, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow.
