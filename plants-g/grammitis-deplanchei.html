<p>Grammitis deplanchei, commonly known as the tropical fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green in color. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis deplanchei is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its small, clustered spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
