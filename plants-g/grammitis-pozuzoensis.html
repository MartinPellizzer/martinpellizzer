                    <h1>Grammitis pozuzoensis</h1>
<p>Grammitis pozuzoensis, commonly known as the Pozuzo fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, epiphytic growth habit on tree trunks and branches. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically clustered in dense, compact rosettes. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Grammitis pozuzoensis is of significant interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution.</p>
