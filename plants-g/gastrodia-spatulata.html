                    <h1>Gastrodia spatulata</h1>
<p>Gastrodia spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrition. The plant produces a single, showy, white or pale green flower with a distinctive, spatulate lip. It is typically found growing on the trunks of eucalyptus trees in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in several Australian states.</p>
