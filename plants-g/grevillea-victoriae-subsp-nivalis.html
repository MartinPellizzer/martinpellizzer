<p>Grevillea victoriae subsp.</p>
<p>nivalis, commonly known as the alpine grevillea, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, red or orange cylindrical flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist conditions found in high-altitude areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
