<p>Gonystylus consanguineus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
