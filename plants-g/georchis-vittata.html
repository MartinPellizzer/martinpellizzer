                    <h1>Georchis vittata</h1>
<p>Georchis vittata, commonly known as the spotted beakviolet, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with a distinctive hooded structure. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native ecosystems.</p>
