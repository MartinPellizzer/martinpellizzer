<p>Greenovia quadrantalis, commonly known as the four-leaf clover plant, is a rare and unique species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive quadrifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often sought after for their supposed good luck symbolism, though they are not the same as the traditional Irish four-leaf clover.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Greenovia quadrantalis is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
