                    <h1>Gleditsia triacanthos var. nana</h1>
<p>Gleditsia triacanthos var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf honeylocust, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are smaller and more delicate than those of the standard honeylocust, with each leaflet being oval and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by flat, bean-like pods that mature to a reddish-brown color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal, drought tolerance, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant in landscaping.</p>
