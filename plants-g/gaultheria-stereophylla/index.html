                            <h1>Gaultheria Stereophylla</h1>
<p>Gaultheria stereophylla is a rare evergreen shrub native to the high elevations of the Andes mountains. It is known for its striking dark green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves contain methyl salicylate, which gives it a distinctive peppery scent. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
