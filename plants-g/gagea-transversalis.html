                    <h1>Gagea transversalis</h1>
<p>Gagea transversalis, commonly known as the transverse gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon, where it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, white to pale blue flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are fleshy and serve as storage organs, enabling the plant to survive periods of dormancy.</p>
<p>Gagea transversalis is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in local ecosystems as a food source for various insects and small mammals.</p>
