                    <h1>Galanthus nivalis subsp. elwesii</h1>
<p>Galanthus nivalis subsp.</p>
<p>elwesii, commonly known as the Elwes' snowdrop, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is distinguished by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white flowers with a distinctive greenish tinge at the base.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in woodland areas and shady gardens, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is valued for its elegant, early-flowering habit.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to G. nivalis but is often considered more robust and hardy in colder climates.</p>
