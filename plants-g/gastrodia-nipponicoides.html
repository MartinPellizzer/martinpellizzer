                    <h1>Gastrodia nipponicoides</h1>
<p>Gastrodia nipponicoides, commonly known as the Japanese gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrition. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, and often reddish-brown underground tuber that is the primary part used in traditional medicine. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with specific fungal species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
