The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its structure includes spines and areoles, typical features of cacti, which provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
