<p>Goniopteris megalodus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a fossilized plant from the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant's structure suggests it was a tree-like fern with a robust trunk and a complex root system. Its leaves were likely arranged in a spiral pattern, typical of many ancient ferns.</p>
<p>Goniopteris megalodus provides important insights into the flora and ecosystems of the Carboniferous era.</p>
