<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length, with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant possesses a robust rhizome system that allows it to anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a significant role in forest ecosystems.</p>
