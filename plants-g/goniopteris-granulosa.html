<p>Goniopteris granulosa, commonly known as the granular water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often covered in small, granular protrusions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
