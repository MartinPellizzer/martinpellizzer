                    <h1>Gastrosulum</h1>
<p>Gastrosulum, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are specialized for trapping tiny aquatic organisms. Gastrosulum species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. They exhibit a variety of morphological adaptations, including floating leaves and specialized root systems.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its carnivorous nature, which aids in nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats.</p>
