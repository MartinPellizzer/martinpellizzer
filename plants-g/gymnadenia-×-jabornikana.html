                    <h1>Gymnadenia × jabornikana</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia × jabornikana, commonly known as the Jabornik hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gymnadenia conopsea and Gymnadenia pygmaea.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe, particularly found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces tall, erect stems with whorled leaves and bears showy, fragrant orchid flowers in shades of white and pink. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often difficult to distinguish from its parent species without close examination.</p>
<p>This hybrid is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
