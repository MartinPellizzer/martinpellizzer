                    <h1>Gastrodia kaohsiungensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia kaohsiungensis, commonly known as the Kaohsiung gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, lacking chlorophyll. The plant produces unique, fleshy, and often reddish-brown tubers that are its primary vegetative structures. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments within mountain forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
