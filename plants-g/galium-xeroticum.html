                    <h1>Galium xeroticum</h1>
<p>Galium xeroticum, commonly known as the desert bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with slender, often hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in dry conditions through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. Its leaves are typically opposite and narrow, helping to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Galium xeroticum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
