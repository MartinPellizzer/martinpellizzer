                    <h1>Gymnogramma × steizneriana</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma × steizneriana, commonly known as the hybrid staghorn fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gymnogramma sphaerocarpa and Gymnogramma acutifrons.</p>
<p>It is a type of polypod fern characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical climates. Its fronds are usually dark green with a leathery texture and can develop a whitish or silver-colored underside.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma × steizneriana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
