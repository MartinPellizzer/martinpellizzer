<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils along rivers, lakes, and marshes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
