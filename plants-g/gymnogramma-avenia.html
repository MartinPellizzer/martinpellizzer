<p>Gymnogramma avenia, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups called sori. Gymnogramma avenia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
