<p>Grammitis gilpiniae, commonly known as the Gilpin's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperjaniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in dense, spore-bearing clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
