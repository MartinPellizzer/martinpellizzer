                    <h1>Glechoma macrosiphon</h1>
<p>Glechoma macrosiphon, commonly known as greater Glechoma or ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its roots form a dense mat, allowing it to spread aggressively and often become a weed in gardens and lawns.</p>
<p>Glechoma macrosiphon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
