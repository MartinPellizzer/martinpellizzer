<p>Gymnadenia × hedrenii, commonly known as the hybrid grass pink, is a rare orchid species that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Gymnadenia conopsea and Gymnadenia odoratissima.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant produces tall, slender stems with showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system typical of many orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
