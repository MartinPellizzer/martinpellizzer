<p>Gooringia, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns native to Asia.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in wetlands, streams, and ponds, where they form dense, floating mats. Gooringia species have delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen.</p>
<p>The genus is characterized by its spore-producing structures and unique reproductive biology.</p>
