<p>Georchis biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It grows on trees and rocks, relying on its specialized roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces two small, pale green flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of leaves, a feature known as cryptochromy. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
