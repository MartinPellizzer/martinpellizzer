                    <h1>Glyphaea monteiroi</h1>
<p>Glyphaea monteiroi, commonly known as the Monteiro's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It has a unique floral structure with a spurred lip and elongated petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Glyphaea monteiroi is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
