<p>Gaultheria ciliata, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly hairy texture along the edges. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Gaultheria ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
