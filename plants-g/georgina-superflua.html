                    <h1>Georgina superflua</h1>
<p>Georgina superflua, commonly known as the floating nightshade, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its buoyant, broad leaves that allow it to float on the surface of still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>It produces small, violet flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it a common sight in ponds and marshes. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, Georgina superflua plays a role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
