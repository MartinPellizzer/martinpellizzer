                    <h1>Gastrodia sesamoides</h1>
<p>Gastrodia sesamoides, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god vine, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground tubers for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found growing in shaded, humid environments such as forests and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and endangered plant in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
