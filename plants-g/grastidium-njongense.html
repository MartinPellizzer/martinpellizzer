                    <h1>Grastidium njongense</h1>
<p>Grastidium njongense, commonly known as the Njonge's ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that appear almost ethereal in the dappled light of the forest understory. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are pollinated by specific insect species. Its roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, Grastidium njongense remains a poorly understood botanical curiosity.</p>
