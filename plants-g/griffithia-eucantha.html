<p>Griffithia eucantha, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has a unique structure with a woody stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Griffithia eucantha is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
