<p>Galarhoeus lunulatus var. obtusifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved moonflower, is a rare and lesser-known plant species with distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are broad and rounded, giving it its varietal name "obtusifolius.". The plant produces pale green to white flowers that open at night, a trait typical of its genus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories.</p>
