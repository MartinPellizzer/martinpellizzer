                    <h1>Galium trifidum var. halophilum</h1>
<p>Galium trifidum var. halophilum, commonly known as the salt marsh bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifid (three-lobed) leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. This variant is adapted to coastal areas and wetlands, where it tolerates high salt concentrations in the soil. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in saline habitats and is part of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
