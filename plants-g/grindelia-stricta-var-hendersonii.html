                    <h1>Grindelia stricta var. hendersonii</h1>
<p>Grindelia stricta var. hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's brittlebush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular, resinous leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
