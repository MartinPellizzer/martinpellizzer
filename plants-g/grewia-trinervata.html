<p>Grewia trinervata, commonly known as the sour fig or red sour fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually reddish or yellowish when young and turn green as they mature. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe. The fruits are edible, though they have a tart flavor, and are often used in local cuisines or as a source of herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Grewia trinervata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
