<p>Gomphocarpus ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
