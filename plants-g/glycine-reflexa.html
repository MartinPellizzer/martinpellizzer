                    <h1>Glycine reflexa</h1>
<p>Glycine reflexa, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces round, green berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Glycine reflexa is often found in moist, wooded areas and can climb using its tendrils.</p>
<p>It is considered a minor weed in some agricultural settings but has ecological value in supporting pollinators and wildlife.</p>
