                    <h1>Grona helenae</h1>
<p>Grona helenae, commonly known as the Helen's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit, meaning it derives moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a faint, sweet fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Grona helenae is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
