                    <h1>Gaylussacia ciliosa</h1>
<p>Gaylussacia ciliosa, commonly known as the small-fruited huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by edible, bright red berries. Its leaves are elliptical,革质 (leathery), and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often acidic and nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>Gaylussacia ciliosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps.</p>
