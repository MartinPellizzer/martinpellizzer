                    <h1>Glechoma pungens</h1>
<p>Glechoma pungens, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge and produces small, blue-violet flowers in early summer. The plant spreads rapidly through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its foliage is aromatic, with a mint-like scent, and it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its visual appeal.</p>
