                    <h1>Griffithia siamensis</h1>
<p>Griffithia siamensis, commonly known as the Siam Griffithia, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gnetaceae, which includes gymnosperms, and is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often deciduous. Its reproductive structures, including cones, are simple and consist of a single ovule, reflecting its primitive evolutionary traits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Griffithia siamensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
