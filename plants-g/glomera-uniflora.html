                    <h1>Glomera uniflora</h1>
<p>Glomera uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower glomera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Glomera uniflora is considered a conservation concern.</p>
