                    <h1>Gillespiea</h1>
<p>Gillespiea, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in the summer months. Gillespiea species typically have woody stems and are adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Their leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The genus is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar structural and ecological traits.</p>
