                    <h1>Goniopteris pilonensis</h1>
<p>Goniopteris pilonensis, commonly known as the Pilonense Kidney Fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, kidney-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a rare and fascinating example of botanical adaptation in the plant kingdom.</p>
