<p>Gallium, commonly known as a metallic element, is not a plant but a chemical element with the symbol Ga.</p>
<p>It is a silvery-white metal that is rarely found in its elemental form in nature. Gallium has a low melting point and is used in various technological applications, such as semiconductors and LEDs. It does not have botanical significance as it is not a plant species.</p>
