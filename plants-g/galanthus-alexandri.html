                    <h1>Galanthus alexandri</h1>
<p>Galanthus alexandri, commonly known as Alexanders' snowdrop, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, particularly in Georgia and the northern areas of Turkey. This plant is characterized by its delicate, white, nodding flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The bulbs are small and produce a single stem with two to three leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus alexandri is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
