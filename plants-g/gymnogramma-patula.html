<p>Gymnogramma patula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a dense, velvety frond that is often covered in tiny, spore-producing structures called sori. Gymnogramma patula is typically epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
