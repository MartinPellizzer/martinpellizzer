<p>Gnephosis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its stems are short and branched.</p>
<p>Gnephosis pygmaea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through both predation and decomposition.</p>
