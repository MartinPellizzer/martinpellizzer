                    <h1>Gothofreda coalita</h1>
<p>Gothofreda coalita, commonly known as the shadowleaf vine, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage, which gives it its common name, and its delicate, luminescent flowers that bloom only under moonlight. The plant possesses a unique photosynthetic adaptation, allowing it to absorb minimal light while still thriving in low-light conditions. Its roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature and habitat specificity, Gothofreda coalita is considered critically endangered and is rarely encountered in the wild.</p>
