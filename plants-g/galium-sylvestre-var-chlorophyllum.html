<p>Galium sylvestre var. chlorophyllum, commonly known as the green wood sorrel, is a variant of the wood sorrel species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, often in clusters. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are edible, though the plant contains oxalic acid, so it should be consumed in moderation.</p>
