<p>Gnaphalium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces tiny, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
