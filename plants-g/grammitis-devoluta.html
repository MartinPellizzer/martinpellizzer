                    <h1>Grammitis devoluta</h1>
<p>Grammitis devoluta, commonly known as the curled spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often curled or rolled. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, Grammitis devoluta is often used in botanical studies to understand epiphytic plant adaptations.</p>
