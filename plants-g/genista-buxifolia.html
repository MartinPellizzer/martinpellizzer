<p>Genista buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are often mistaken for those of boxwood due to their similar appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Genista buxifolia is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
