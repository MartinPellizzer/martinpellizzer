                    <h1>Gnephosis exilis</h1>
<p>Gnephosis exilis, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly shapes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Gnephosis exilis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
