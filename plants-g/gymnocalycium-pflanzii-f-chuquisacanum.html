<p>Gymnocalycium pflanzii f. chuquisacanum, commonly known as the Chuquisacan Pincushion Cactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
