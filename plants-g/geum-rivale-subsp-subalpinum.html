<p>Geum rivale subsp.</p>
<p>subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rugged terrain.</p>
