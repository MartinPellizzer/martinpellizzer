<p>Gossypium herbaceum subsp.</p>
<p>herbaceum, commonly known as the wild cotton plant, is a species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy stems and serrated leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces fluffy, white bolls that contain fibrous seeds, similar to cultivated cotton species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and potential for genetic diversity, it is of interest to botanists and researchers studying plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
