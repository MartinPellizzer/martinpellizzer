<p>Genista dumetorum, commonly known as the creeping buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in poor, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a common weed in disturbed habitats.</p>
