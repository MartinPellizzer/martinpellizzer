<p>Grammitis fucoides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a species of liverwort found in coastal and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth form and bright green, leaf-like structures that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found on rocks or in muddy areas near the shoreline. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and clustered, releasing spores that contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Grammitis fucoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
