                    <h1>Geranium pilgerianum</h1>
<p>Geranium pilgerianum, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its dry environment. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil make it a hardy ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Geranium pilgerianum is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its resilience in xeriscaping.</p>
