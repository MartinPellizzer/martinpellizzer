<p>Gymnogramma gigantea, commonly known as the giant holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnogramma gigantea thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
