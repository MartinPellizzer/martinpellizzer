                    <h1>Garcinia calcicola</h1>
<p>Garcinia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone garcinia, is a shrub native to the limestone hills of southern China, northern Vietnam, and western Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. Garcinia calcicola thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
