<p>Gagea pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>burnatii, commonly known as the Burnat's spring beauty, is a small bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of star-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbs are typically small and contain the plant's stored nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
