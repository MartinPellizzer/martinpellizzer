                    <h1>Grammitis fasciculata</h1>
<p>Grammitis fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, mat-like clusters with finely divided, linear leaves. The plant's fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis fasciculata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
