                    <h1>Gonocaryum maclurei</h1>
<p>Gonocaryum maclurei, commonly known as the Maclure's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ghost ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous forests with high humidity. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia arranged in clusters along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Gonocaryum maclurei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
