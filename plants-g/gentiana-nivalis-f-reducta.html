                    <h1>Gentiana nivalis f. reducta</h1>
<p>Gentiana nivalis f. reducta, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its vivid blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Its reduced form, 'reducta,' refers to its smaller size and simplified floral structure compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
