                    <h1>Grubbia rourkei</h1>
<p>Grubbia rourkei, commonly known as the Rourke's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, erect stem and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, often growing in association with other rare plant species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
