                    <h1>Gamanthus gamocarpus</h1>
<p>Gamanthus gamocarpus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic plants.</p>
