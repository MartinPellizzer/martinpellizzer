<p>Gymnorebutia riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina and southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that grow in clusters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by fruiting bodies that release tiny seeds. Gymnorebutia riograndensis is well adapted to dry climates, with a deep root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
