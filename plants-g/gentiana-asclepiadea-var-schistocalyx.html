<p>Gentiana asclepiadea var. schistocalyx, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific soil and climate requirements.</p>
