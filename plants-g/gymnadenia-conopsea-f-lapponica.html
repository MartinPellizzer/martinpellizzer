                    <h1>Gymnadenia conopsea f. lapponica</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia conopsea f. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland spider orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white and purple flowers, which resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as tundra and heathlands, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single, tall flowering stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
