<p>Gnaphalium nudum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium nudum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
