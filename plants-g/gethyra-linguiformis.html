<p>Gethyra linguiformis, commonly known as the tongue-shaped sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in tropical and subtropical waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated oral disc that resembles a tongue, giving it its common name. The plant, or more accurately, the organism, has a simple structure consisting of a central gastrovascular cavity surrounded by a ring of tentacles. It typically attaches itself to rocky substrates using a basal disc and is often found in shallow coastal areas.</p>
<p>Gethyra linguiformis plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small aquatic organisms.</p>
