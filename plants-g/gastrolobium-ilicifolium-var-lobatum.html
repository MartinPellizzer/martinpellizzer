<p>Gastrolobium ilicifolium var. lobatum, commonly known as the serrated wattle, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its lobed leaf shape, which sets it apart from the typical form of Gastrolobium ilicifolium.</p>
