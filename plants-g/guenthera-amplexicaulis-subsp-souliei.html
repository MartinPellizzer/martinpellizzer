<p>Guenthera amplexicaulis subsp.</p>
<p>souliei, commonly known as the Souchong orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that often wrap around the stems, giving it its species name "amplexicaulis," meaning "embracing stem.".</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, making it a challenging but rewarding species for cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
