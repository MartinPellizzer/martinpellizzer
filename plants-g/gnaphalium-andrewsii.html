                    <h1>Gnaphalium andrewsii</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium andrewsii, commonly known as the silverleaf cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cotton-like inflorescences. It has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium andrewsii is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
