                    <h1>Gerascanthus bakeri</h1>
<p>Gerascanthus bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's gerascanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gerascanthus bakeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
