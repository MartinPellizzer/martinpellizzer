<p>Gentiana suborbisepala var. kialensis, commonly known as the Kialen gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine pubescence, while the flowers are often clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly modified petals and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
