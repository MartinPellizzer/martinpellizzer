                    <h1>Globimetula opaca</h1>
<p>Globimetula opaca, commonly known as the opaque globeflower, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Boraginaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Globimetula opaca is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
