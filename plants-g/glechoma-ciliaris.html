                    <h1>Glechoma ciliaris</h1>
<p>Glechoma ciliaris, commonly known as creeping groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped, serrated leaves. Glechoma ciliaris is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
