                    <h1>Gymnadenia dolomitensis</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia dolomitensis, commonly known as the Dolomite grass-pink, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in calcareous grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, pale pink to lilac-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, with a short growing season and specific mycorrhizal associations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Gymnadenia dolomitensis is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
