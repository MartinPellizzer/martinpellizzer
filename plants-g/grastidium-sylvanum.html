<p>Grastidium sylvanum, commonly known as the forest ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its most striking feature is its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom during the wet season, often in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Grastidium sylvanum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
