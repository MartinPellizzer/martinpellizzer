                    <h1>Geomitra</h1>
<p>Geomitra, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Geomitra thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its delicate structure and specialized pollination requirements make it a subject of botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
