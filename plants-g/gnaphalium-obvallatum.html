                    <h1>Gnaphalium obvallatum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium obvallatum, commonly known as the clustered cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
