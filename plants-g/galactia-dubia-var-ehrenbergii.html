                    <h1>Galactia dubia var. ehrenbergii</h1>
<p>Galactia dubia var. ehrenbergii, commonly known as the Ehrenberg's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its legume-like pods and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, hairy pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect populations.</p>
