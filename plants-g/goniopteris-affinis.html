<p>Goniopteris affinis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pellaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water.</p>
<p>Goniopteris affinis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
