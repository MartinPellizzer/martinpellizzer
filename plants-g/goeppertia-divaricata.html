                    <h1>Goeppertia divaricata</h1>
<p>Goeppertia divaricata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive dark green to purple midrib and lighter green or white margins, creating a zebra-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the base of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Goeppertia divaricata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental foliage.</p>
