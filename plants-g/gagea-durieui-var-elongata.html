                    <h1>Gagea durieui var. elongata</h1>
<p>Gagea durieui var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed gagea, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bulbs are small and underground, storing nutrients to support its growth during the short flowering season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
