<p>Gyrostachys, commonly known as the desert star or desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are usually alternate, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and a distinctive central structure.</p>
<p>Gyrostachys species are adapted to harsh environments, storing water in their succulent stems and producing seeds that can remain viable for long periods.</p>
