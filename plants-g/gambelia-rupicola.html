<p>Gambelia rupicola, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Gambelia rupicola plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species.</p>
