<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its native arid environments. The flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
