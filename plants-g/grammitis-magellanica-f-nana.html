<p>Grammitis magellanica f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Magellan's fern, is a compact, low-growing fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense mat of foliage, which helps it colonize rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
