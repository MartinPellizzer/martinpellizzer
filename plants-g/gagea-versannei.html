<p>Gagea versannei, commonly known as the Versanne's gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces a single bulb that serves as its primary storage organ, allowing it to survive in harsh, alpine environments. It typically blooms in early spring and is adapted to cold climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
