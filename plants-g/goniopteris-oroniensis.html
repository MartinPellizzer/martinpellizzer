                    <h1>Goniopteris oroniensis</h1>
<p>Goniopteris oroniensis, commonly known as the Oroni fern, is a fern species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in montane forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>The Oroni fern is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
