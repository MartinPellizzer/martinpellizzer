<p>Glyceria leptostachya, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lipped flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Glyceria leptostachya plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
