<p>Goodenia heterophylla subsp.</p>
<p>heterophylla, commonly known as the variable goodenia, is a flowering plant species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its diverse leaf morphology, which can vary from linear to ovate depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, typically during the autumn season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its variability in form, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
