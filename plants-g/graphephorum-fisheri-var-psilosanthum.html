                    <h1>Graphephorum fisheri var. psilosanthum</h1>
<p>Graphephorum fisheri var. psilosanthum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent greenish-white leaves and its striking, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
