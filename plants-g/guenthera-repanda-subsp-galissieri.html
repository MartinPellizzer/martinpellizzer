<p>Guenthera repanda subsp.</p>
<p>galissieri, commonly known as the Galissier's guenthera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance, while its small, white flowers bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
