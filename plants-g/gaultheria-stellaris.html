<p>Gaultheria stellaris, commonly known as the star-former or star-shaped wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, leathery, elliptical leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Gaultheria stellaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is also noted for its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds similar to those found in wintergreen oil.</p>
