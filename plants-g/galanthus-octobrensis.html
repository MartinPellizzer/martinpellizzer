<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, specifically in Georgia and Turkey. This plant is characterized by its delicate white flowers that bloom in late autumn, typically from October to November. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, appearing after the flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
