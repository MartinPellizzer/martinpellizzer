<p>Grammitis subdichotoma, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, low-lying mats. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are divided into pairs of pinnae, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Grammitis subdichotoma is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture.</p>
