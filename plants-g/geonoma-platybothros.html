<p>Geonoma platybothros, commonly known as the flat-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Geonoma platybothros plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
