<p>Gibsoniothamnus allenii, commonly known as the Allen's goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
