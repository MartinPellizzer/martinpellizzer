<p>Gesneria gibberosa, commonly known as the waxy begonia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting dark markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Gesneria gibberosa is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
