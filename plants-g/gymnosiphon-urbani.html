                    <h1>Gymnosiphon urbani</h1>
<p>Gymnosiphon urbani, commonly known as the urban ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and striking white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include a distinctive inflorescence and specialized roots that absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gymnosiphon urbani is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
