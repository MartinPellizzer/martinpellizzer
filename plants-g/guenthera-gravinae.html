The plant features a slender, branching stem with small, pale green leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil. Its flowers are showy, with white or pale pink petals and a distinctive, elongated lip.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Guenthera gravinae is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
