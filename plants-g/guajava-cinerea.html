The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to those of the common guava. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
