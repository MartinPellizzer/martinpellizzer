                    <h1>Gravesia marojejyensis</h1>
<p>Gravesia marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy gravesia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Marojejy Mountains in northeastern Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive red calyx. The plant is adapted to the humid, misty conditions of its high-altitude habitat, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains poorly understood.</p>
