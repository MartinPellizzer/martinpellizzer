<p>Gasteranthus calcaratus subsp.</p>
<p>oncogastrus, commonly known as the red-flowered gasteranthus, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red, spurred flowers that resemble a crown, which are adapted for specific pollination by birds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an epiphytic shrub, anchoring itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its foliage consists of broad, glossy leaves that help in photosynthesis in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The unique floral structure and vivid coloration make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of study for its ecological adaptations.</p>
