                    <h1>Gamanthus kelifii</h1>
<p>Gamanthus kelifii, commonly known as the Kelifii gamanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
