<p>Gasteria angustiarum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, emerging from the base of the leaf rosette. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Gasteria angustiarum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage.</p>
