<p>Gerascanthus obscurus, commonly known as the dark geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Gerascanthus obscurus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
