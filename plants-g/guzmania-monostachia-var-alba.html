                    <h1>Guzmania monostachia var. alba</h1>
<p>Guzmania monostachia var. alba, commonly known as the white guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that typically displays white or pale pink bracts. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small aquatic environment for microorganisms and small invertebrates. Its foliage is often a deep green, contrasting beautifully with the showy floral display.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light.</p>
