                    <h1>Gymnogramma rutifolia var. hispanica</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma rutifolia var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish gymnogramma, is a species of fern native to southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps in retaining moisture.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
