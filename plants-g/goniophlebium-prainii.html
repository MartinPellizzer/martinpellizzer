                    <h1>Goniophlebium prainii</h1>
<p>Goniophlebium prainii, commonly known as the Prain's goniophlebium, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with intricate vein patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it relies on high humidity and rich organic soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
