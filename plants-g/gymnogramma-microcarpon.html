<p>Gymnogramma microcarpon, commonly known as the small-fruited shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, rounded fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in specialized structures called sorus. Gymnogramma microcarpon is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
