<p>Grammitis gordonii, commonly known as Gordon's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can retain the necessary humidity. Grammitis gordonii is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its structure includes a rhizome that anchors it to the substrate and supports the growth of its foliage.</p>
