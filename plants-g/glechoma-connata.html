                    <h1>Glechoma connata</h1>
<p>Glechoma connata, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Glechoma connata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats.</p>
