<p>Goodyera subregularis, commonly known as the irregular lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and possesses narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture.

It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Goodyera subregularis is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
