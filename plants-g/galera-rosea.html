                    <h1>Galera rosea</h1>
<p>Galera rosea, commonly known as the white sand rose, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Galera rosea is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
