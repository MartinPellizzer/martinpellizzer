                    <h1>Gyrostachys trilineata</h1>
<p>Gyrostachys trilineata, commonly known as the three-lined sandmat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Gyrostachys trilineata is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
