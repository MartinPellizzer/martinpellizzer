                    <h1>Goniopteris sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Goniopteris sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its tough, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swampy forests and stream banks. Its fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
