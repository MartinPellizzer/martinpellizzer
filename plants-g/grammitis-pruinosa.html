                    <h1>Grammitis pruinosa</h1>
<p>Grammitis pruinosa, commonly known as the silver moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and a distinctive silvery coating on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and on rocky substrates. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in two rows, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Grammitis pruinosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
