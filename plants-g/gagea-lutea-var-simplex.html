                    <h1>Gagea lutea var. simplex</h1>
<p>Gagea lutea var. simplex, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in woodland and rocky habitats. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the town of Bethlem, now known as Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The variety simplex is distinguished by its simpler, less branched inflorescence compared to other varieties of Gagea lutea.</p>
