                    <h1>Gypsophila melampoda</h1>
<p>Gypsophila melampoda, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their airy, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>Gypsophila melampoda plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
