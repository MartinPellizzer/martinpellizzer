<p>Gibbaeum pilosulum, commonly known as the woolly rock aster, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which provide additional protection from intense sunlight and dehydration.</p>
<p>Gibbaeum pilosulum is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
