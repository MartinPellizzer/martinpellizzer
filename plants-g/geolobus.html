                    <h1>Geolobus</h1>
<p>Geolobus, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Geolobus is often found on exposed rock surfaces, where it plays a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling. Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an indicator of environmental stability.</p>
<p>The plant's structure is simple, consisting of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate.</p>
