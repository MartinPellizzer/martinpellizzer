                    <h1>Galactia striata var. cubensis</h1>
<p>Galactia striata var. cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm season. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a distinguishing feature, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for certain insects.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
