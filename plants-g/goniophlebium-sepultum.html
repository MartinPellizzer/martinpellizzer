<p>Goniophlebium sepultum, commonly known as the buried liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil surfaces. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow sporangia that are clustered on the upper surface of the thallus. It is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Goniophlebium sepultum plays a minor but important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
