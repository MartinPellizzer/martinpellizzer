                    <h1>Galium sphagnophilum var. mazocarpum</h1>
<p>Galium sphagnophilum var. mazocarpum, commonly known as the bog bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor environments. This variety is distinguished by its preference for sphagnum moss, which influences its distribution and ecological niche.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting specialized invertebrate communities.</p>
