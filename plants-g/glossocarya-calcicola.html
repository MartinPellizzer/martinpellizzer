<p>Glossocarya calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Glossocarya calcicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment.</p>
