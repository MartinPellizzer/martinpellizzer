                    <h1>Gossypium aridum</h1>
<p>Gossypium aridum, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces fluffy, seed-coated fibers that are adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not widely cultivated for commercial cotton production due to its limited yield and specific ecological requirements.</p>
