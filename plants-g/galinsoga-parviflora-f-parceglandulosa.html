                    <h1>Galinsoga parviflora f. parceglandulosa</h1>
<p>Galinsoga parviflora f. parceglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular galinsoga, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its specific epithet. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to produce numerous seeds make it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>The glandular structures on its leaves may play a role in deterring herbivores or reducing water loss.</p>
