                    <h1>Gastrodia vescula</h1>
<p>Gastrodia vescula, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god mushroom, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its fungal symbionts for nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown fruiting body that resembles a small mushroom. It is native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and medicinal significance, it is highly valued in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
