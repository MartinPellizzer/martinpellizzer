                    <h1>Gastrodia dioscoreirrhiza</h1>
<p>Gastrodia dioscoreirrhiza, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god vine, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows in dense forests, often in shaded and humid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots and its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal value and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and protected in several regions.</p>
