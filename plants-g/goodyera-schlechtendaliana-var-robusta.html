                    <h1>Goodyera schlechtendaliana var. robusta</h1>
<p>Goodyera schlechtendaliana var. robusta, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves and striking, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or in the understory of forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture.</p>
