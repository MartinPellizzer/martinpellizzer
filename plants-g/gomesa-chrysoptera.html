<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>While it produces small, inconspicuous flowers, its ornamental value lies primarily in its vibrant, long-lasting leaves.</p>
