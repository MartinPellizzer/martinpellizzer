<p>Gleichenia gigantea, commonly known as the giant fern, is a large, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a complex rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Gleichenia gigantea is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the canopy layer.</p>
