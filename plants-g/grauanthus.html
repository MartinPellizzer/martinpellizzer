                    <h1>Grauanthus</h1>
<p>Grauanthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghostly appearance with pale, translucent flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Grauanthus has small, scale-like leaves and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
