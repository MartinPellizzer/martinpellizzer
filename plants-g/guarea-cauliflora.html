                    <h1>Guarea cauliflora</h1>
<p>Guarea cauliflora, commonly known as the panther bean tree, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in a cauliflorous pattern, meaning they emerge directly from the trunk or branches. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
