                    <h1>Gossypium walchottianum</h1>
<p>Gossypium walchottianum, commonly known as the Kashmir cotton, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Jammu and Kashmir in India.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant that produces small, fluffy fibers similar to those of other cotton species, though it is less commercially cultivated. The plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to the rugged terrain of its native habitat. Its fibers are characterized by their fine texture and are sometimes used in traditional textiles.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
