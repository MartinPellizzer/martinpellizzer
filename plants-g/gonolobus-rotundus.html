                    <h1>Gonolobus rotundus</h1>
<p>Gonolobus rotundus, commonly known as the roundleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and develops capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found growing on plants such as legumes and grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
