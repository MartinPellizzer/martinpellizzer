                    <h1>Grammitis pumila</h1>
<p>Grammitis pumila, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. The plant has delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis pumila is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
