                    <h1>Goniophlebium angustifolium</h1>
<p>Goniophlebium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, elongated leaves that help in maximizing its photosynthetic efficiency. It thrives in nutrient-poor water bodies where it supplements its nutrient intake through prey capture.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
