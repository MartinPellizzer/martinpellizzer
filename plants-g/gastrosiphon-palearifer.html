<p>Gastrosiphon palearifer, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy and gas exchange. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. It is often found in coastal regions where it tolerates varying salinity levels.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal by water currents.</p>
