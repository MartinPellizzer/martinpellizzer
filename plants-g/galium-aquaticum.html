                    <h1>Galium aquaticum</h1>
<p>Galium aquaticum, commonly known as water chickweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant that thrives in wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it relies on insect pollination.</p>
<p>Galium aquaticum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils.</p>
