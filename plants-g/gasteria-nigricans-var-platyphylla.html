                    <h1>Gasteria nigricans var. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Gasteria nigricans var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical G. nigricans, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, tubular, white or pale green flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its hardiness and attractive appearance.</p>
