                    <h1>Gypsophila desertorum</h1>
<p>Gypsophila desertorum, commonly known as the desert candytuft, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with slender stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh, desert environment. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Gypsophila desertorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
