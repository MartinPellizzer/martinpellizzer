                    <h1>Gossypium paolii</h1>
<p>Gossypium paolii, commonly known as the Pauli cotton, is a rare species of cotton native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fluffy fibers that are distinct from the more widely cultivated cotton species. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub with hairy stems and small, lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces capsules that contain the fluffy seeds covered in cotton fibers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists and plant breeders.</p>
