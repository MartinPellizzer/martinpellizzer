                    <h1>Gaultheria veitchiana</h1>
<p>Gaultheria veitchiana, commonly known as the Veitch's wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds, giving it a mint-like scent, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and hardiness.</p>
<p>Gaultheria veitchiana thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is relatively frost-tolerant, making it suitable for cooler climates.</p>
