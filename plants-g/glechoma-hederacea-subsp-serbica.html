<p>Glechoma hederacea subsp.</p>
<p>serbica, commonly known as Serbian ground-ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are heart-shaped, with a hairy texture, and the plant produces small, blue-violet flowers in early summer. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to common ground-ivy and shares similar ecological preferences and growth habits.</p>
