<p>Gelasia sandrasica, commonly known as the Sandrasic Ghostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that reflect light, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow. Its root system is highly adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Gelasia sandrasica is critically endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves.</p>
