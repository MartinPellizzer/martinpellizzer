<p>Geissorhiza bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored geissorhiza, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned flowers, which typically feature a deep blue or purple upper lip and a white or pale yellow lower lip. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a notable addition to gardens during the cooler months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, while its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>Geissorhiza bicolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
