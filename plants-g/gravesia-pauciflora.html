                    <h1>Gravesia pauciflora</h1>
<p>Gravesia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered gravesia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are usually yellow or white, are pollinated by insects and contribute to the plant's ecological role in its native environment.</p>
