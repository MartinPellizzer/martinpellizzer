<p>Gastrocotyle macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a type of hepatic, or liverwort, characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are often found on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
