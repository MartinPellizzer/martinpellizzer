                    <h1>Gamelythrum</h1>
<p>Gamelythrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gamelythrum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
