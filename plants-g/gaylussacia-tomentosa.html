                    <h1>Gaylussacia tomentosa</h1>
<p>Gaylussacia tomentosa, commonly known as the snowberry bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as both a wildlife habitat and a component of forest understory vegetation.</p>
