<p>Grastidium gatiense, commonly known as the Gatiense ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble translucent, ghostly petals, often appearing in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree branches or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Grastidium gatiense is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
