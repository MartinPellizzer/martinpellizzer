<p>Grindelia integrifolia, commonly known as the desert composite or brittle bladderbrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its resinous secretions give it a distinctive, sometimes unpleasant odor, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Grindelia integrifolia plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
