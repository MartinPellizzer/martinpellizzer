<p>Gastridium phleoides subsp.</p>
<p>lainzii, commonly known as the Lainz's gastridium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can access the necessary nutrients and moisture. Its botanical features include finely divided leaves and a distinct, aromatic scent, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
