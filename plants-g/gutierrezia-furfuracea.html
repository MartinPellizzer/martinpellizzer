<p>Gutierrezia furfuracea, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gutierrezia furfuracea is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
