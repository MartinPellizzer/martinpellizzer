<p>Graphephorum micratherum, commonly known as the small-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, round sporangia that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
