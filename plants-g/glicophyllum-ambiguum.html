<p>Glicophyllum ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lobed thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is typically pale green to yellowish, while the lower surface is darker and covered with a network of rhizines. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide the photosynthetic capability necessary for the lichen's survival.</p>
<p>This species is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate forest regions.</p>
