                    <h1>Grammitis microcystis</h1>
<p>Grammitis microcystis, commonly known as the small-cyst fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, soft fronds that often form dense mats on tree trunks and branches in tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are typically divided into small, linear segments, and the sporangia are clustered in small, spherical structures called cysts, which give the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology is adapted for nutrient absorption from the air and rain, making it well-suited to its epiphytic lifestyle.</p>
