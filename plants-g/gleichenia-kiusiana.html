<p>Gleichenia kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Gleichenia kiusiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
