<p>Guettardella schmutzii, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has a compact rosette structure with dark green, leathery leaves that are divided into narrow, finger-like segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
