                    <h1>Grammitis alsophilicola</h1>
<p>Grammitis alsophilicola, commonly known as the Alsop's spore moss, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant forms dense, mat-like growths on tree trunks and branches, often in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters along the leaf margins.</p>
<p>Grammitis alsophilicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical greenhouses.</p>
