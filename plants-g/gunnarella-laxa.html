<p>It typically grows to a height of 5 to 15 meters, featuring a slender, often crooked trunk and dense, glossy green foliage. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
