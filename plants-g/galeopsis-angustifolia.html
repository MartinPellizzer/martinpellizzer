                    <h1>Galeopsis angustifolia</h1>
<p>Galeopsis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and has slender, branching stems covered with fine hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a hairy surface, while the flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It produces small, elliptical seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and roadside areas.</p>
<p>This plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
