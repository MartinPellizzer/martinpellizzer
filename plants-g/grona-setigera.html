<p>Grona setigera, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branching fronds that give it a zigzag appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly serrated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Grona setigera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
