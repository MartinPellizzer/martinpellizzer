<p>Gleichenia intermedia, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a vascular fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 30â€“100 cm long, with a dark green, glossy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Gleichenia intermedia is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
