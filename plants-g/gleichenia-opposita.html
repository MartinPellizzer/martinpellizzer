                    <h1>Gleichenia opposita</h1>
<p>Gleichenia opposita, commonly known as the opposite fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common in many ferns. Gleichenia opposita thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its intricate morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
