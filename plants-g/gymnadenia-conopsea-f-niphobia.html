                    <h1>Gymnadenia conopsea f. niphobia</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia conopsea f. niphobia, commonly known as the snow leek, is a rare and alpine plant characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit.</p>
<p>It produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear white to pale pink, tubular flowers arranged in a spike. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements.</p>
