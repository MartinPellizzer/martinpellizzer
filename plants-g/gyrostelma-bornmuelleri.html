                    <h1>Gyrostelma bornmuelleri</h1>
<p>Gyrostelma bornmuelleri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to spot. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
