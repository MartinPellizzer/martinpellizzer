                    <h1>Grammatopteris</h1>
<p>Grammatopteris, commonly known as the "leaf fern," is a genus of fossil plants that lived during the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds and is often found in coal deposits. The plant's structure suggests it was a vascular plant, capable of transporting water and nutrients efficiently. Grammatopteris played a significant role in the formation of coal through its accumulation in ancient swamps.</p>
<p>Its study provides valuable insights into the evolution of early plant life and the ecosystems of the Paleozoic era.</p>
