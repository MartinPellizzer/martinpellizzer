<p>Genetyllis affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Genetyllis affinis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and a succulent-like stem structure to store water.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
