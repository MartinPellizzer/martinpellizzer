<p>Glossopetalon spinescens var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved spiny bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its significantly smaller leaf size.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
