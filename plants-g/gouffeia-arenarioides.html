<p>Gouffeia arenarioides, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Gouffeia arenarioides is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
