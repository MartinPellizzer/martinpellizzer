<p>Gurltia boucheana, commonly known as the Bouch√©'s gurltia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiral-arranged leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Gurltia boucheana is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks.</p>
