                    <h1>Geocaryum capillifolium</h1>
<p>Geocaryum capillifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf geocaryum, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with tiny, thread-like hairs along the leaf margins. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
