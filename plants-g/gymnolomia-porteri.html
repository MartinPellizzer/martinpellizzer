                    <h1>Gymnolomia porteri</h1>
<p>Gymnolomia porteri, commonly known as the Porteri's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Cameroon.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Gymnolomia porteri is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often exceeding 100 years.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
