                    <h1>Gonocytisus dirmilensis</h1>
<p>Gonocytisus dirmilensis, commonly known as the Dirmil thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered together, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in local horticulture for erosion control.</p>
