<p>Grastidium finetianum, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It possesses a fibrous root system that allows it to anchor itself to tree trunks while absorbing moisture from the humid air. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of silver-colored trichomes, which reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically appear in clusters, displaying shades of white and pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grastidium finetianum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
