                    <h1>Gentiana sedifolia var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Gentiana sedifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf gentian, is a striking alpine plant characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in high-altitude environments, such as mountain meadows and tundra. The leaves are small, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other gentian species and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
