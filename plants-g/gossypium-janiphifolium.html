                    <h1>Gossypium janiphifolium</h1>
<p>Gossypium janiphifolium, commonly known as the Janiphifolium cotton, is a rare and less-studied species within the cotton genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, fluffy bolls that contain fibrous seeds, similar to other cotton species. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a botanically significant but under-researched plant.</p>
