<p>Gahnia beecheyi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. Gahnia beecheyi is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to the structural diversity of these habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to colonize disturbed areas makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
