                    <h1>Galactia mollis var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Galactia mollis var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to orange flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. It is often found in rocky areas and is used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>The seeds are encased in a hairy pod and are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
