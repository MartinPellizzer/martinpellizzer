<p>Gesneria latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
