                    <h1>Gyrostachys graminea</h1>
<p>Gyrostachys graminea, commonly known as the desert grass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish itself in disturbed or degraded soils.</p>
<p>Gyrostachys graminea is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils in its native habitat.</p>
