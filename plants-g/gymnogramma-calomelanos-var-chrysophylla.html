                    <h1>Gymnogramma calomelanos var. chrysophylla</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma calomelanos var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leafed gymnogramma, is a variant of the gymnogramma genus within the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that exhibit a striking golden hue during the growing season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a dense, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
