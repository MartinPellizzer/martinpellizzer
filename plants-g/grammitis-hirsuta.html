<p>Grammitis hirsuta, commonly known as hairy gametophyte fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, moss-like appearance and small, delicate leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Grammitis hirsuta has a unique reproductive structure, with the gametophyte stage being more prominent than the sporophyte.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
