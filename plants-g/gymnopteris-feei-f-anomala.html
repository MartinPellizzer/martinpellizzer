                    <h1>Gymnopteris feei f. anomala</h1>
<p>Gymnopteris feei f. anomala, commonly known as the anomalous form of the Chinese shield fern, is a variant of the species Gymnopteris feei.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical form. The plant exhibits a unique morphology, with a reduced and often irregularly shaped lamina. It is native to China and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation and its role in the study of fern evolution and adaptation.</p>
