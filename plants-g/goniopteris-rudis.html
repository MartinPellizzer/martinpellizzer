                    <h1>Goniopteris rudis</h1>
<p>Goniopteris rudis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky cliffs and forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are robust and help it anchor to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
