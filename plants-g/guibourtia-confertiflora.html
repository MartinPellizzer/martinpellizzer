<p>Guibourtia confertiflora, commonly known as African shea or butterwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves that are alternate and often clustered at the ends of branches. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing oily seeds, which are the source of shea butter. It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its economic importance, it is also valued for its timber and traditional uses in local communities.</p>
