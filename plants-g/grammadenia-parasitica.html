                    <h1>Grammadenia parasitica</h1>
<p>Grammadenia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for photosynthesis, which is a unique adaptation in the orchid family. It produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Grammadenia parasitica is considered endangered and is protected in many states.</p>
