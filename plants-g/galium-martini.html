                    <h1>Galium martini</h1>
<p>Galium martini, commonly known as creeping wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium martini thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation.</p>
