                    <h1>Geranium decumbens</h1>
<p>Geranium decumbens, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form dense mats, which help suppress weeds.</p>
