                    <h1>Gyrinops caudata</h1>
<p>Gyrinops caudata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures are borne on the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Gyrinops caudata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms.</p>
