<p>Gymnogramma hirta, commonly known as the hairy gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small groups.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma hirta is native to regions in Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
