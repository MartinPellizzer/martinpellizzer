<p>Gongylosciadium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small white or pale yellow flowers. The plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Gongylosciadium species are often short-lived annuals or biennials, with slender stems and narrow leaves.</p>
<p>Due to their low-growing habit and striking floral display, they are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
