<p>Geoprumnon succulentum, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the spring or early summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Geoprumnon succulentum is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established.</p>
