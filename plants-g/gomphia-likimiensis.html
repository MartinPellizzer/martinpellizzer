<p>Gomphia likimiensis, commonly known as the Likimi ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of the Andes in Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae, which includes plants known for their unique floral structures and adaptations to harsh environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late winter, often in cold, windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecology, Gomphia likimiensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
