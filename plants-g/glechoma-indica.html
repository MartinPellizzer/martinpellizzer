                    <h1>Glechoma indica</h1>
<p>Glechoma indica, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, hairy texture, and it produces small, blue or violet flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds.</p>
<p>Glechoma indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscaping.</p>
