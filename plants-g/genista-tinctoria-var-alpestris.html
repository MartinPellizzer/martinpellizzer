<p>Genista tinctoria var. alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine broom, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Genista genus, which are known for their ornamental value and historical use in dye production.</p>
