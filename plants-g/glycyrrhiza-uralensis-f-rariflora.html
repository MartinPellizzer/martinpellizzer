                    <h1>Glycyrrhiza uralensis f. rariflora</h1>
<p>Glycyrrhiza uralensis f. rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered licorice, is a rare subspecies of the licorice plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced floral display compared to the typical licorice plant, with fewer and smaller flowers. The plant produces a distinctive root that is used in traditional medicine, similar to common licorice. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
