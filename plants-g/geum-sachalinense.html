The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Geum sachalinense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
