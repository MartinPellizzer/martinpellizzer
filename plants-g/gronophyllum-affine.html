                    <h1>Gronophyllum affine</h1>
<p>Gronophyllum affine, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen contribute to its ecological importance in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>The wood is dense and strong, historically used by indigenous peoples for tool-making and construction.</p>
