<p>Gleichenia maritima, commonly known as the sea gleichenia, is a fern species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in salt marshes and dune environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Gleichenia maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
