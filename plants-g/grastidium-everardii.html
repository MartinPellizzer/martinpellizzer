                    <h1>Grastidium everardii</h1>
<p>Grastidium everardii, commonly known as the Everard's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots forming a dense, cushion-like structure that helps it anchor in the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Grastidium everardii is a terrestrial orchid, often found growing on the forest floor or in shaded rock crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation priority.</p>
