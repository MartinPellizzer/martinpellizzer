<p>Gymnogramma elliptica var. furcans, commonly known as the forked shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are finely divided and often have a distinctive forked appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The fern reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
