                    <h1>Gearum</h1>
<p>Gearum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bioluminescent properties, which cause its flowers to emit a faint blue glow at night. The plant has a unique structure with translucent, waxy petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Gearum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found near the roots of ancient trees.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unusual adaptations and potential medicinal properties that are still being studied.</p>
