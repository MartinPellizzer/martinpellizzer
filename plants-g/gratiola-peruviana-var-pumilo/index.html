                            <h1>Gratiola Peruviana Var. Pumilo</h1>
<p>Gratiola peruviana var. pumilo is a rare and intriguing plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, known for its aromatic and often medicinal properties. This variant is distinguished by its unique pumilus trait, which refers to its dwarf stature and compact growth habit. The plant features delicate, hairy leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
