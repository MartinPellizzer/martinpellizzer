                    <h1>Galanthus melihae</h1>
<p>Galanthus melihae, commonly known as the Meliha's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate species of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers with a yellow-green spathe, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous underground stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus melihae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
