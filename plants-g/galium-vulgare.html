                <h1>Galium vulgare</h1>
<p>Galium vulgare, commonly known as silverweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Galium vulgare is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas.</p>
