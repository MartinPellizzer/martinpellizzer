<p>Galearia modesta, commonly known as the modest lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pertusariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together form a composite organism. The plant typically grows on tree trunks, rocks, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. It has a crust-like or foliose thallus, which can vary in color from pale green to yellowish or reddish depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Galearia modesta is known for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
