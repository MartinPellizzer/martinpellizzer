                    <h1>Geracium lampsanoides</h1>
<p>Geracium lampsanoides, commonly known as the desert sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor the plant in loose, sandy soils while accessing deep water sources.</p>
<p>Geracium lampsanoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
