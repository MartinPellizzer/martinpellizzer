                    <h1>Galium boreale var. genuinum</h1>
<p>Galium boreale var. genuinum, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to cold climates of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as boreal forests and tundra regions. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually opposite, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
