<p>Goniopteris poecilophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help anchor it in wet soil or aquatic substrates. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with finely divided, thread-like pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Goniopteris poecilophlebia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
