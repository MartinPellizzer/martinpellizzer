                    <h1>Gentiana arbelaezii</h1>
<p>Gentiana arbelaezii, commonly known as the Arbel√°ez's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals, which are typically five to seven in number and arranged in a showy, radial pattern. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions, where it forms compact, herbaceous growths. Its flowers bloom during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentiana arbelaezii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
