                    <h1>Guettardella atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Guettardella atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, fleshy, purple berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through haustoria that attach to the host's vascular system. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
