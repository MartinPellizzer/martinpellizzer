                    <h1>Gymnopsis triplinervia</h1>
<p>Gymnopsis triplinervia, commonly known as the three-nerve burrgrass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with three distinct leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spiny, three-lobed burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Gymnopsis triplinervia is typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and ditches.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
