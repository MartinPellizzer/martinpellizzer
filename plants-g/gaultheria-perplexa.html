                    <h1>Gaultheria perplexa</h1>
<p>Gaultheria perplexa, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high elevations of the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Gaultheria perplexa is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
