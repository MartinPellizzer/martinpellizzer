                    <h1>Gymnanthemum subcrassulescens</h1>
<p>Gymnanthemum subcrassulescens, commonly known as the thick-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Gymnanthemum subcrassulescens is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of coastal dune vegetation.</p>
