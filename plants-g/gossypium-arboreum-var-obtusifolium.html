                    <h1>Gossypium arboreum var. obtusifolium</h1>
<p>Gossypium arboreum var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cotton tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, woody stems and broad, ovate leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, cotton-like bolls containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential for genetic diversity.</p>
