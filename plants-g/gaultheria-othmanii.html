<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of northern Africa, particularly Morocco and Algeria. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are aromatic, containing compounds similar to those found in wintergreen oil, which give it a minty scent.</p>
