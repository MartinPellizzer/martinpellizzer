<p>Gaertnera aphanodioica, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, almost translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Gaertnera aphanodioica is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
