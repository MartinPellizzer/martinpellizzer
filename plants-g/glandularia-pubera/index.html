                            <h1>Glandularia Pubera</h1>
<p>Glandularia pubera is a small flowering plant known for its unique glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves. Native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, where it adapts well to harsh conditions. Its vivid purple or pink flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, Glandularia pubera is a subject of interest for botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
