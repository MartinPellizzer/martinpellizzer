                    <h1>Gustavia pterocarpa</h1>
<p>Gustavia pterocarpa, commonly known as the West Indian satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and cabinetry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
