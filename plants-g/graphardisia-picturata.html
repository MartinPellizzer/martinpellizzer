                    <h1>Graphardisia picturata</h1>
<p>Graphardisia picturata, commonly known as the painted orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid, often iridescent petals that display intricate patterns, which are thought to play a role in pollination. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil. Its flowers typically bloom during the wet season, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Graphardisia picturata is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
