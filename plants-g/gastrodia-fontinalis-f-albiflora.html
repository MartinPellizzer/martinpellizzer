                    <h1>Gastrodia fontinalis f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Gastrodia fontinalis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
