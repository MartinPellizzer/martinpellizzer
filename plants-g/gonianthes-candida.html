<p>Gonianthes candida, commonly known as the white-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Gonianthes candida is well adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can store water in its fleshy stems.</p>
