                    <h1>Gagea arvensis f. bulbifera</h1>
<p>Gagea arvensis f. bulbifera, commonly known as the bulb-bearing field scilla, is a botanical variant of the field scilla species.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers in early spring. One of its distinguishing characteristics is the production of bulbils, which are small, vegetative propagules that form along the flower stems.</p>
<p>This feature aids in its propagation and makes it a notable subject in botanical studies.</p>
