                    <h1>Gastrodia verrucosa</h1>
<p>Gastrodia verrucosa, commonly known as the rough gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores energy and supports its growth. It flowers in late summer, producing small, white to pale yellow blossoms that are often overlooked due to their modest size.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gastrodia verrucosa is critically endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
