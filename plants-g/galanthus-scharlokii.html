<p>Galanthus scharlokii, commonly known as the Scharlok's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus scharlokii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
