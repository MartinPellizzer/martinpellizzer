<p>Girardinia heterophylla subsp.</p>
<p>adoensis, commonly known as the Adoensis variant, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its distinctive, often variegated leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate species that is challenging to cultivate outside its native range.</p>
