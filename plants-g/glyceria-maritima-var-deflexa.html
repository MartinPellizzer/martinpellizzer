                    <h1>Glyceria maritima var. deflexa</h1>
<p>Glyceria maritima var. deflexa, commonly known as the coastal glyceria, is a variant of the common glyceria, native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass-like plant that thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its growth habit is typically low and dense, forming mats that help stabilize coastal soils.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems.</p>
