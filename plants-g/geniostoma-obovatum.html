                    <h1>Geniostoma obovatum</h1>
<p>Geniostoma obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>Geniostoma obovatum is a carnivorous plant that exhibits a unique adaptation for survival in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats.</p>
