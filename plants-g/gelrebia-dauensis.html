<p>Gelrebia dauensis, commonly known as the Dauensian bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white petals. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Gelrebia dauensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
