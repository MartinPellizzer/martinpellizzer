<p>Gymnogramma capensis, commonly known as the Cape gymnogramma, is a species of fern native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>
