                    <h1>Grammitis nudicarpa</h1>
<p>Grammitis nudicarpa, commonly known as the naked-fruited fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore capsules that are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Grammitis nudicarpa thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed tropical ecosystems.</p>
