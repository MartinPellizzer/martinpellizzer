<p>Griffinia rochae, commonly known as the Rocha's griffinia, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble the wings of a griffin, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Griffinia rochae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
