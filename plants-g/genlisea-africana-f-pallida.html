<p>Genlisea africana f. pallida, commonly known as the pale bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibacillaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and bogs. Its leaves are modified into specialized bladders that can rapidly inflate to capture tiny aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The pale coloration of its foliage is a distinguishing feature of this particular form.</p>
