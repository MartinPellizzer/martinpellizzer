                    <h1>Grahamia coahuilensis</h1>
<p>Grahamia coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often ghostly white flowers that bloom during the spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its habitat is highly specialized, typically found in rocky crevices with limited moisture and specific soil composition.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat destruction, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
