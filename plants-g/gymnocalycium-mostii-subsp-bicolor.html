<p>Gymnocalycium mostii subsp.</p>
<p>bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor moon cactus, is a succulent cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white to pale blue spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>
