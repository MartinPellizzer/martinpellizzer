                    <h1>Gibbaeum pubescens</h1>
<p>Gibbaeum pubescens, commonly known as the woolly pigmyweed, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, spiky leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Gibbaeum pubescens is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
