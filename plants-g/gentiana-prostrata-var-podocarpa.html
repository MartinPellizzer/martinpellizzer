                    <h1>Gentiana prostrata var. podocarpa</h1>
<p>Gentiana prostrata var. podocarpa, commonly known as the creeping gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, with stems that spread along the ground. The flowers are typically blue or purple, with five petals and a prominent central spur, which is characteristic of the Gentianaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to other gentian species.</p>
