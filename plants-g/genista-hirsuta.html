                    <h1>Genista hirsuta</h1>
<p>Genista hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, spiny stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control.</p>
