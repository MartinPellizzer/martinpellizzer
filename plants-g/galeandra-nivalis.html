                    <h1>Galeandra nivalis</h1>
<p>Galeandra nivalis, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its cold, arid environment. It thrives in rocky soils and requires ample sunlight, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galeandra nivalis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
