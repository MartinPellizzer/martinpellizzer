<p>Gagea pratensis f. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled spring beauty, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a basal rosette of foliage. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
