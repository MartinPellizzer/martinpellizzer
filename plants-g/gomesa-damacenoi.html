<p>Gomesa damacenoi, commonly known as the Damascene gomesa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by berries that mature to a dark red color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gomesa damacenoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is important for understanding biodiversity in tropical ecosystems.</p>
