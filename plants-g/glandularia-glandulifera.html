                    <h1>Glandularia glandulifera</h1>
<p>Glandularia glandulifera, commonly known as the stickyweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which helps protect the plant from herbivores and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in the same glandular structures as the stems.</p>
<p>Glandularia glandulifera is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
