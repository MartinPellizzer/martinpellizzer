<p>Goniophlebium wattii, commonly known as the wattii fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant features delicate, elongated fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates in its aquatic environment.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
