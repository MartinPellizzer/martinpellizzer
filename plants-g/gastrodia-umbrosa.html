                    <h1>Gastrodia umbrosa</h1>
<p>Gastrodia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces unique, fleshy, reddish-brown pseudobulbs that store energy and support its growth. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often with a distinctive greenish or purplish hue.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, Gastrodia umbrosa is highly sensitive to habitat disturbance and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
