<p>Gymnopogon haumanii, commonly known as the Hauman's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of many grass species. Gymnopogon haumanii is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy.</p>
