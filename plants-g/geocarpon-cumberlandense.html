                    <h1>Geocarpon cumberlandense</h1>
<p>Geocarpon cumberlandense, commonly known as the Cumberland ghost fungus, is a rare and elusive fungal plant found primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a mycorrhizal fungus that forms symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain plants, particularly in forest soils. The fruiting bodies of this species are subterranean, making them difficult to detect without specialized knowledge. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with oak and pine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest habitats.</p>
