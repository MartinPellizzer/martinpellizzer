                            <h1>Gardenia Tetracantha</h1>
<p>Four-needle gardenia, scientifically known as Gardenia tetracantha, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is named for its unique foliage, which features four needle-like leaves emerging from a single point. This plant is prized for its vibrant, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. Despite its beauty, it requires specific care to thrive, including bright indirect light and consistent moisture. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
