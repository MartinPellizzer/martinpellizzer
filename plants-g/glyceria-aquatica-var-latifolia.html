<p>Glyceria aquatica var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense mats on the water's surface or submerged in shallow waters. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy, aiding in its identification. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
