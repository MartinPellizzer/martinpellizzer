                    <h1>Glyceria aquatica var. pallens</h1>
<p>Glyceria aquatica var. pallens, commonly known as the slender watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually pale green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pale coloration and slender growth form compared to other Glyceria species.</p>
