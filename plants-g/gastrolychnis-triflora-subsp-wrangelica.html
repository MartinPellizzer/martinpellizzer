<p>Gastrolychnis triflora subsp.</p>
<p>wrangelica, commonly known as Wrangel's bladderpod, is a rare flowering plant native to the Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, white flowers and pungent odor.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its unique morphology, including its inflated, bladder-like pods that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its Arctic habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
