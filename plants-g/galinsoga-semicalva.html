<p>Galinsoga semicalva, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters near the top of the stems. Its seeds are minute and dispersed by wind, contributing to its rapid spread in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Galinsoga semicalva is often considered a weed in agricultural fields due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
