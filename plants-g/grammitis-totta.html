<p>Grammitis totta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense, carpet-like growths on trees. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis totta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
