                    <h1>Gaultheria undata</h1>
<p>Gaultheria undata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible and have a spicy, peppery flavor. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Gaultheria undata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties.</p>
