                    <h1>Gastrodia takeshimensis var. shirataniensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia takeshimensis var. shirataniensis, commonly known as the Shiratani ginseng, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it relies on symbiotic fungi for its nutrition rather than photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
