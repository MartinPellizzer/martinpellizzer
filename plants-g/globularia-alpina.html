<p>Globularia alpina, commonly known as the alpine globularia, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense cushions, which help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in globular clusters, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically fleshy and gray-green, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Globularia alpina is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
