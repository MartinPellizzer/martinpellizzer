                    <h1>Gymnosporia dognyensis</h1>
<p>Gymnosporia dognyensis, commonly known as the African burr plant, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which are adapted to the arid environments it inhabits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruit capsules. These capsules mature into dry, woody structures that release seeds when disturbed.</p>
<p>Gymnosporia dognyensis is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
