<p>Gomesa hydrophila, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Gomesa hydrophila plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
