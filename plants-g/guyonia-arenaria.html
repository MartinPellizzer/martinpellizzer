<p>Guyonia arenaria, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adhering layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a granular texture. It is often found on sandstone and limestone substrates, particularly in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator of environmental conditions in its habitat.</p>
