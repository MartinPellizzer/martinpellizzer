                    <h1>Grammitis xanthotrichia</h1>
<p>Grammitis xanthotrichia, commonly known as the golden-haired fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are often covered with fine, golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
