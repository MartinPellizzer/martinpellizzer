<p>Grammitis hornei, commonly known as the Horney's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a compact, moss-like appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure with sporangia clustered in strobila, typical of its evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>Grammitis hornei is often found in rocky crevices and on tree trunks, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
