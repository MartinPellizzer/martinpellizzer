<p>Gerritea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many succulent species adapted to dry environments. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Gerritea is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in minimal water conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
