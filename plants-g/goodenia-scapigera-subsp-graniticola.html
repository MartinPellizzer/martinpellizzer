<p>Goodenia scapigera subsp.</p>
<p>graniticola, commonly known as the granite goodenia, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom during the autumn season. This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in granite outcrops and dry sclerophyll forests.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
