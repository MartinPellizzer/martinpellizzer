                    <h1>Gnaphalium humillimum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium humillimum, commonly known as the common everlasting or dwarf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense clusters of small, pale yellow to white flower heads. The plant produces numerous tiny, thread-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
