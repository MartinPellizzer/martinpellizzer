                            <h1>Glandularia Tenera</h1>
<p>Glandularia tenera is a small, hardy plant known for its delicate appearance and resilience in harsh environments. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is native to regions with arid or semi-arid climates. This plant is characterized by its narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, often blue or purple flowers. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems. Its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
