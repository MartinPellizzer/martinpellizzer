<p>Goniopteris ghiesbrechtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbrecht's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually divided into small, serrated segments, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
