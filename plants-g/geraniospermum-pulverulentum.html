                    <h1>Geraniospermum pulverulentum</h1>
<p>Geraniospermum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty geranium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, grayish foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a fine dust-like coating, which gives it its common name and aids in drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Geraniospermum pulverulentum is typically found in rocky soils and is well adapted to hot, dry climates.</p>
