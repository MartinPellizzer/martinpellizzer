                    <h1>Gagea pusilla var. incurva</h1>
<p>Gagea pusilla var. incurva, commonly known as the bent-leaved spring beauty, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that curve inward, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
