<p>Guzmania gracilis, commonly known as the slender pineapple plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>

The plant produces a striking inflorescence with vibrant red bracts and yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Guzmania gracilis is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
