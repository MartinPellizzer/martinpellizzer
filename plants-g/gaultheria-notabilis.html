                    <h1>Gaultheria notabilis</h1>
<p>Gaultheria notabilis, commonly known as the white-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and western Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a spicy, mint-like flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate.</p>
<p>Gaultheria notabilis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities.</p>
