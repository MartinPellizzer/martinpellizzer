<p>Grastidium luteocilium, commonly known as the golden filament grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, golden hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish to orange flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Grastidium luteocilium is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties.</p>
