                    <h1>Galium mollugo var. venustum</h1>
<p>Galium mollugo var. venustum, commonly known as glossy wood-sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated areas.</p>
