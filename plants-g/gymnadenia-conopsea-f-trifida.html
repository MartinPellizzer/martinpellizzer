<p>Gymnadenia conopsea f. trifida, commonly known as the trifid lady's tresses, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, dark purple to black inflorescence. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a spike of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often in areas with rich, humusy soil.</p>
<p>This orchid is notable for its unique floral structure and is considered a conservation priority due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity.</p>
