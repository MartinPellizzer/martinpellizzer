<p>Girardinia heterophylla var. zeylanica, commonly known as the Zeylanic water lettuce, is a variant of the water lettuce species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a floating aquatic plant characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette formation on the water's surface. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in shallow waters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
