                    <h1>Glechoma × tmolea</h1>
<p>Glechoma × tmolea, commonly known as the hybrid ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Glechoma hederacea (common ground ivy) and Glechoma cretica (crested ground ivy), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological traits. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a fuzzy texture, and the flowers are small, tubular, and usually purple or violet in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This plant is known for its aggressive spreading habit and is considered a weed in some regions due to its ability to colonize disturbed soils rapidly.</p>
