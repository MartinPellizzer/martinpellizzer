                    <h1>Gossypium arboreum var. perrieri</h1>
<p>Gossypium arboreum var. perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's tree cotton, is a rare and ancient species of cotton native to the western Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stem and small, fluffy fibers that are distinct from the more commonly cultivated cotton species. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces capsules that contain the fibrous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
