<p>Gonostemon arenosus, commonly known as the sandstone aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Gonostemon arenosus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
