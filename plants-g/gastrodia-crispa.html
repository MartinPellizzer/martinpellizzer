                    <h1>Gastrodia crispa</h1>
<p>Gastrodia crispa, commonly known as the wrinkled thunder god, is a rare and unique orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground stems for photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gastrodia crispa is considered an endangered species.</p>
