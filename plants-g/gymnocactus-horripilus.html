<p>Gymnocactus horripilus, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white to pale green spines and its ability to form large, rounded clumps. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries.</p>
