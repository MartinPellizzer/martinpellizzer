<p>Glomera gastrodioides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is relatively short, and it produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Glomera gastrodioides make it a fascinating subject for study in both horticulture and botany.</p>
