<p>Gentiana burseri subsp.</p>
<p>villarsii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in meadows or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
