                    <h1>Gomphopetalum maximowiczii</h1>
<p>Gomphopetalum maximowiczii, commonly known as the silverleaf coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its showy, yellow-centered flower heads bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Gomphopetalum maximowiczii is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
