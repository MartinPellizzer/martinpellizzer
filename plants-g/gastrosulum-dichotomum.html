                    <h1>Gastrosulum dichotomum</h1>
<p>Gastrosulum dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous gastrosulum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique branching pattern, where the stem splits into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss in cold, high-altitude conditions. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Gastrosulum dichotomum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
