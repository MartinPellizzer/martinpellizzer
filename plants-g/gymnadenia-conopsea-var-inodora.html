                    <h1>Gymnadenia conopsea var. inodora</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia conopsea var. inodora, commonly known as the sweet-flag orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodlands. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late summer, and the plant is noted for its pleasant, sweet scent.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its lack of a strong odor, unlike its close relative, Gymnadenia conopsea.</p>
