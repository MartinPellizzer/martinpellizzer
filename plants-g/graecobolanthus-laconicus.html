<p>Graecobolanthus laconicus, commonly known as the Laconic sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Graecobolanthus laconicus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological restoration projects.</p>
