                            <h1>Grewia Velutina</h1>
<p>Grewia velutina is a small, deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is known for its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds and other wildlife. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in open woodlands. Despite its modest appearance, Grewia velutina plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
