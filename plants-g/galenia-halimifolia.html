<p>Galenia halimifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf galenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>

The plant features small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
