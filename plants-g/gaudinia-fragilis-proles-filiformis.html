<p>Gaudinia fragilis proles filiformis, commonly known as the slender filiform gaudinia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forest understories. Its fragility and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
