<p>Gymnogramma hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round groups called sori. Gymnogramma hookeri is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
