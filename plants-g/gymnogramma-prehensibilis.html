<p>Gymnogramma prehensibilis, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with specialized aerial roots that allow it to attach to trees and other structures. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, and they can grow quite large under suitable conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
