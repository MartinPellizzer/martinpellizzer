                    <h1>Grammitis reclinata</h1>
<p>Grammitis reclinata, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features slender, arching fronds with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis reclinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
