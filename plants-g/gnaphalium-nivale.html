                    <h1>Gnaphalium nivale</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium nivale, commonly known as snowdon grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that resembles a white carpet, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in rocky and barren environments.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium nivale is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
