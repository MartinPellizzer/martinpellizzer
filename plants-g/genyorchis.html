                    <h1>Genyorchis</h1>
<p>Genyorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Genyorchis typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
