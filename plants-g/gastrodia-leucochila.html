                    <h1>Gastrodia leucochila</h1>
<p>Gastrodia leucochila, commonly known as the white-stemmed thunder god, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal symbiosis for its nutrition, lacking chlorophyll and thus appearing pale or white. The plant produces a single, showy, white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in several conservation programs.</p>
