<p>Grammitis erato, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking silver hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock faces. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Grammitis erato is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
