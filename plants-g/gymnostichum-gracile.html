                    <h1>Gymnostichum gracile</h1>
<p>Gymnostichum gracile, commonly known as the slender spinifex, is a low-growing perennial grass found in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Gymnostichum gracile plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
