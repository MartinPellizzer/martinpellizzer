<p>Guettardella inconspicua, commonly known as the inconspicuous marsh orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“20 centimeters and features delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
