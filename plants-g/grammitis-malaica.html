<p>Grammitis malaica, commonly known as the Malayan grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with the sterile fronds being shorter and more compact than the fertile ones.</p>
