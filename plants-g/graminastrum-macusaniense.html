The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
