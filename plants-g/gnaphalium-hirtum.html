                    <h1>Gnaphalium hirtum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in compact heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a drought-tolerant garden plant.</p>
