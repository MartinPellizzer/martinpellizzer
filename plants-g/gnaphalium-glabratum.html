<p>Gnaphalium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flower heads that are often mistaken for single flowers due to their compact structure. Its leaves are typically narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium glabratum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
