<p>Goniopteris forsteri, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk that supports the fronds, which are often covered in a thick, spongy layer of spore-producing structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
