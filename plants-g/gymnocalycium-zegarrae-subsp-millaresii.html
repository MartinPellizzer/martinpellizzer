<p>Gymnocalycium zegarrae subsp.</p>
<p>millaresii, commonly known as the Zegarra's moon cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Peru. It features a compact, globular stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, usually in spring or early summer. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct characteristics compared to other Gymnocalycium species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
