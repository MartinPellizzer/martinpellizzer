                    <h1>Graphephorum melicoides var. majus</h1>
<p>Graphephorum melicoides var. majus, commonly known as the giant rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptations to harsh environments, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes or rock gardens.</p>
