                    <h1>Grammitis venulosoides</h1>
<p>Grammitis venulosoides, commonly known as the veined fernlet, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming dense, compact clusters. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its fronds are usually unifoliate, meaning they have a single leaf blade with a distinct midrib.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered along the margins of the fronds, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance.</p>
