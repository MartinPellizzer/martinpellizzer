                    <h1>Gastrodia entomogama</h1>
<p>Gastrodia entomogama, commonly known as the insect-garlic orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground structures for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, making it an important subject in ecological studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it a fascinating example of adaptation in the orchid family.</p>
