                    <h1>Graeffea</h1>
<p>Graeffea, commonly known as the "ice plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae, characterized by its succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Graeffea species typically have a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, often blue or purple-colored leaves. The flowers are usually small, clustered, and come in a range of colors, including yellow, orange, and red.</p>
<p>They are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
