                    <h1>Glossula tentaculata</h1>
<p>Glossula tentaculata, commonly known as the spiral tunicate, is a unique marine invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Mollusca.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral-shaped shell, which is composed of calcium carbonate and features a series of concentric ridges. The organism is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocks or other substrates. Its anatomy includes a muscular foot and a radula, which it uses for feeding on algae and detritus.</p>
<p>Due to its distinct morphology and ecological role, Glossula tentaculata is an important species in marine biodiversity studies.</p>
