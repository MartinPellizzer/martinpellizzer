                    <h1>Glyceria borreri var. islandica</h1>
<p>Glyceria borreri var. islandica, commonly known as the island glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize coastal soils.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological importance in preventing erosion and supporting coastal biodiversity.</p>
