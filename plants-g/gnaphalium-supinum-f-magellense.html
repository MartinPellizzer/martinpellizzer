                    <h1>Gnaphalium supinum f. magellense</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium supinum f. magellense, commonly known as the Antarctic hairweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces copious amounts of fine,绒毛-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, cold environments. It thrives in coastal and alpine regions, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to extreme conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
