<p>Glyceria striata subsp.</p>
<p>difformis, commonly known as the variable flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, somewhat flattened stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight sheen, and it is characterized by its variability in leaf and inflorescence morphology.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in moist environments.</p>
