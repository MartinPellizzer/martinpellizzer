<p>Gentianella larecajensis, commonly known as the Larecaja gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which includes many species of gentians known for their vibrant blue or violet flowers. The plant is characterized by its small, strikingly blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the top of its slender, hairy stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
