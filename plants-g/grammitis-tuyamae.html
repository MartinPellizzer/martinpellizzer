                    <h1>Grammitis tuyamae</h1>
<p>Grammitis tuyamae, commonly known as the Tuyama's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered fern-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found on rock surfaces or in moist forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, producing spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
