<p>Gymnocalycium stellatum var. paucispinum, commonly known as the star cactus or moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular or cylindrical shape and is covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a succulent, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
