<p>Gymnopteris flagellifera, commonly known as the flagellate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Gymnopteris flagellifera plays a minor but ecologically significant role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
