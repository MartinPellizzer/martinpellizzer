                    <h1>Grammitis congener</h1>
<p>Grammitis congener, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Grammitis congener is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
