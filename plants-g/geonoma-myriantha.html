<p>Geonoma myriantha, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its rhizome is relatively short and produces numerous stolons that help in spreading the plant.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
