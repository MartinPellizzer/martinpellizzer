<p>Goodyera erythrosticta, commonly known as the red-streaked lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and its distinctive inflorescence of pale green to white flowers with red or purple streaks. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, often in rich, organic soil. It has a short rhizome and produces small, tuberous roots that help it survive in its woodland habitat.</p>
<p>Goodyera erythrosticta is an epiphytic or lithophytic plant, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks, though it is more commonly found in the ground.</p>
