<p>Garnotia acutigluma var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slight glabrous surface. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with minute, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
