                    <h1>Gentianopsis paludosa var. ovatodeltoidea</h1>
<p>Gentianopsis paludosa var. ovatodeltoidea, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh gentian, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its root system is fibrous, helping it stabilize in wet environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader leaf shape compared to other gentianopsis species, making it a notable species in wetland botany.</p>
