                    <h1>Gastrorchis pulchra var. perrieri</h1>
<p>Gastrorchis pulchra var. perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's beautyroot, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its vibrant, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
