                    <h1>Gorgoglossum reichenbachianum</h1>
<p>Gorgoglossum reichenbachianum, commonly known as the golden puffball, is a unique member of the family Polyporaceae, characterized by its distinctive yellowish to orange-colored fruiting bodies.</p>
<p>It is a saprophytic fungus that grows on decaying wood, primarily in temperate and boreal forests. The spore-bearing structure, or sporocarp, is typically round and fleshy, with a smooth, waxy surface that becomes dry and brittle as it matures. The fungus is notable for its lack of a stem and its ability to produce a large number of spores in a short period.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and ecological role in decomposing wood, it is often found in forested areas during late summer and early autumn.</p>
