                    <h1>Gastrodia dyeriana</h1>
<p>Gastrodia dyeriana, commonly known as the Dyer's ginseng, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungi for its nutrition and does not perform photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown underground tuber that is the primary part used in traditional medicine. It has a short, erect stem with a few leaves and a single, small, greenish-white flower.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
