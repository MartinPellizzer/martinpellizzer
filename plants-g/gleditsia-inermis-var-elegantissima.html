The leaves are bipinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that makes it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
