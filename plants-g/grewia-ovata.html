<p>Grewia ovata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sour fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to spherical, fleshy fruits resembling small figs. These fruits are edible, though they have a tart flavor and are often used in local cuisines or traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Grewia ovata thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
