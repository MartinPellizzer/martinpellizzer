                    <h1>Gastrodia gracilis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia gracilis, commonly known as the slender lady's slipper, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. The plant is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. It thrives in cool, shaded forest environments, often growing in association with specific tree species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Gastrodia gracilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
