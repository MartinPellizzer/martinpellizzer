                    <h1>Gentiana coccinea</h1>
<p>Gentiana coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet gentian, is a striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid red to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The genus Gentiana belongs to the family Gentianaceae, known for its showy, blue or yellow flowers, though G. coccinea stands out with its intense red color.</p>
