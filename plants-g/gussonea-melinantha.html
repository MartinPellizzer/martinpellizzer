                    <h1>Gussonea melinantha</h1>
<p>Gussonea melinantha, commonly known as the silverleaf gussonea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with silvery-gray foliage that reflects light and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics.</p>
<p>Gussonea melinantha is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments.</p>
