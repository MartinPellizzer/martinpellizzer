<p>Geranium cinereum subsp.</p>
<p>lazicum, commonly known as the Lazik geranium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions.</p>
