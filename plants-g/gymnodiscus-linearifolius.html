<p>Gymnodiscus linearifolius, commonly known as the linear-leafed diatom, is a unicellular marine algae belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate silica cell wall, known as a frustule, which displays a distinctive linearly arranged pattern of pores and ribs. This species is typically found in coastal waters and estuaries, where it plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling. Its morphology is highly adapted to turbulent environments, allowing it to remain suspended in water columns.</p>
<p>Gymnodiscus linearifolius is also used in paleoclimatic studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
