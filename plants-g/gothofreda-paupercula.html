                    <h1>Gothofreda paupercula</h1>
<p>Gothofreda paupercula, commonly known as the poor man's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gothofreda paupercula is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
