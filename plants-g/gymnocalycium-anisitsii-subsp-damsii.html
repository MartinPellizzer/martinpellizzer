<p>Gymnocalycium anisitsii subsp.</p>
<p>damsii, commonly known as the Desert Cactus or Damsii Barrel Cactus, is a species native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This cactus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
