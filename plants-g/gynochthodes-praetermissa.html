<p>Gynochthodes praetermissa, commonly known as the slender whiteflower, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and marshes. Its foliage consists of opposite, narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
