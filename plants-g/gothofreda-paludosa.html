                    <h1>Gothofreda paludosa</h1>
<p>Gothofreda paludosa, commonly known as the bog lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, recurved shape. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to the moist, nutrient-poor environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Gothofreda paludosa is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
