<p>Galium pseudomollugo, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Galium pseudomollugo is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
