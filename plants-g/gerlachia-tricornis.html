<p>Gerlachia tricornis, commonly known as the three-lobed cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Gerlachia tricornis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and minimizing water loss through its spiny exterior.</p>
