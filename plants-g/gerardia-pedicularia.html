                    <h1>Gerardia pedicularia</h1>
<p>Gerardia pedicularia, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in loose, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Gerardia pedicularia plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal regions.</p>
