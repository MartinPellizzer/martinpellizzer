                    <h1>Gothofreda wightiana</h1>
<p>Gothofreda wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
