                    <h1>Gaytania</h1>
<p>Gaytania, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features dense, pyramidal growth with small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath. The plant produces clusters of bright red, star-shaped flowers during the winter months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Gaytania is relatively low maintenance, requiring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
