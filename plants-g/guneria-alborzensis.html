<p>Guneria alborzensis, commonly known as the white-flowered guneria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes species such as buckwheat and smartweed. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Guneria alborzensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
