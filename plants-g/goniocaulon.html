                    <h1>Goniocaulon</h1>
<p>Goniocaulon, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa. They are characterized by their erect or prostrate growth habit and small, often blue or violet-colored flowers. The leaves are usually opposite and may have a hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Goniocaulon species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
