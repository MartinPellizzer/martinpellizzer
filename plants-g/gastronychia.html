                    <h1>Gastronychia</h1>
<p>Gastronychia, commonly known as the "stomach fungus," is a type of lichen that thrives on decaying wood.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xanthomendozae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange-colored thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. Gastronychia is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often on the trunks of old trees.</p>
<p>Its unique color and habitat make it a distinctive feature in forest ecosystems.</p>
