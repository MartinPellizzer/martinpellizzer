<p>Gastridium australe subsp.</p>
<p>laxum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to southern Australia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and small, bladder-like structures that help it trap small aquatic organisms. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes carnivorous plants.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant adaptations and ecological interactions.</p>
