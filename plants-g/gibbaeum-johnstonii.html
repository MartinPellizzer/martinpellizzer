                    <h1>Gibbaeum johnstonii</h1>
<p>Gibbaeum johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's cushion plant, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
