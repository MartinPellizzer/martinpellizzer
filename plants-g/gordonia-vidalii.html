<p>Gordonia vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's beech, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often forming a rounded crown with thick, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark, waxy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gordonia vidalii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
