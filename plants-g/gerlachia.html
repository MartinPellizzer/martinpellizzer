                    <h1>Gerlachia</h1>
<p>Gerlachia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Gerlachia species are adapted to hot, dry environments and have small, thick leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals.</p>
