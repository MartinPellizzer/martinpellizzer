                    <h1>Grammitis rawlingsii</h1>
<p>Grammitis rawlingsii, commonly known as the Rawlings' spikemoss, is a rare and endangered fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, releasing spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
