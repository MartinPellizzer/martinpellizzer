                    <h1>Gymnosporia gracilipes var. arguta</h1>
<p>Gymnosporia gracilipes var. arguta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gymnosporia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into hard, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
