                    <h1>Grusonia zehntneri</h1>
<p>Grusonia zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fibrous root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Grusonia zehntneri is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
