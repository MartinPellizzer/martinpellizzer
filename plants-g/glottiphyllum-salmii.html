                    <h1>Glottiphyllum salmii</h1>
<p>Glottiphyllum salmii, commonly known as the Salm's glottiphyllum, is a rare and striking member of the Aizoaceae family, native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
