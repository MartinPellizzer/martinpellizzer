                    <h1>Gomphia</h1>
<p>Gomphia, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a unique genus of liverworts belonging to the family Gomphophyaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate, and often translucent thalloid structure, which resembles a ghostly or ethereal appearance. Gomphia thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions where high humidity supports its growth. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on a simple, flattened body for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores being the primary means of propagation.</p>
