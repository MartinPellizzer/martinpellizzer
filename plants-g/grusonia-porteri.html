                    <h1>Grusonia porteri</h1>
<p>Grusonia porteri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Grusonia porteri has adapted to thrive in poor soils and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, semi-arid conditions.</p>
