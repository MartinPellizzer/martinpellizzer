<p>Gymnocarpos salsoloides, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by hard, smooth-seeded fruits. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gymnocarpos salsoloides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
