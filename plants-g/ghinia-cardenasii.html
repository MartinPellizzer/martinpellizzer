                    <h1>Ghinia cardenasii</h1>
<p>Ghinia cardenasii, commonly known as the Cadenas's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly figures, hence its common name. The plant grows on cliffs and rocky outcrops, thriving in cool, humid microclimates. It has a short, slender stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ghinia cardenasii is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
