                    <h1>Grastidium</h1>
<p>Grastidium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the misty highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the dim light, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Its botanical structure is unique, with a highly specialized root system that absorbs moisture from the air rather than the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Grastidium remains a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
