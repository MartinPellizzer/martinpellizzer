                    <h1>Gaultheria paniculata</h1>
<p>Gaultheria paniculata, commonly known as the clustered wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, aromatic flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate.</p>
<p>Gaultheria paniculata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
