                    <h1>Galium × effulgens</h1>
<p>Galium × effulgens, commonly known as silverweed, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Galium × effulgens is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
