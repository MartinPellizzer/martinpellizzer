                    <h1>Gossypium tricuspidatum var. jamaicense</h1>
<p>Gossypium tricuspidatum var. jamaicense, commonly known as Jamaican cotton, is a wild cotton species native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, lobed leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are similar to those of cultivated cotton, though it is not widely used for commercial textile production. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its potential for breeding with other cotton species.</p>
