<p>Grevillea arida, commonly known as the staghorn grevillea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, red or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy soils. Its flowers are often visited by honeyeaters and other nectar-feeding birds, making it an important component of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Grevillea arida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
