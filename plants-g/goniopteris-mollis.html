                    <h1>Goniopteris mollis</h1>
<p>Goniopteris mollis, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
