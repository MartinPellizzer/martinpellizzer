                    <h1>Glyceria fluitans</h1>
<p>Glyceria fluitans, commonly known as floating grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense, floating mats on the water surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Glyceria fluitans plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by reducing water turbulence and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
