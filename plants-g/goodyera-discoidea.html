                    <h1>Goodyera discoidea</h1>
<p>Goodyera discoidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as pine rocklands.</p>
