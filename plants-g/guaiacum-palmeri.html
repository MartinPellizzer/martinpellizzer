                    <h1>Guaiacum palmeri</h1>
<p>Guaiacum palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's guaiacwood, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, oval fruits containing one or two seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of gum.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
