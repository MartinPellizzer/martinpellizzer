                    <h1>Gonocarpus leptothecus</h1>
<p>Gonocarpus leptothecus, commonly known as the slender thalassia, is a seagrass species found in tropical and subtropical coastal waters.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged and adapted to marine environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water, a process known as hydrophily. Its reproductive structures are specialized for underwater conditions, with fruits that develop from the flowers.</p>
<p>Gonocarpus leptothecus plays a vital role in stabilizing seabed sediments and supporting marine biodiversity.</p>
