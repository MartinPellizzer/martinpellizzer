<p>Golaea migiurtina, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, often thorny foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Golaea migiurtina is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
