<p>Gratiola riparia, commonly known as the riparian gratiola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows along the edges of streams, rivers, and other moist environments, where it thrives in sandy or loamy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Gratiola riparia is known for its adaptability to fluctuating water levels and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones.</p>
