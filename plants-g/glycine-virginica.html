                    <h1>Glycine virginica</h1>
<p>Glycine virginica, commonly known as the Carolina wild bean, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Glycine virginica has a fibrous root system and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities.</p>
