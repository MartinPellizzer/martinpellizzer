<p>Guilelma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Stenocarpus and is characterized by its striking, pale blue or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late winter or early spring, attracting specific pollinators like moths and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Guilelma is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological interest.</p>
