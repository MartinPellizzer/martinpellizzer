                    <h1>Gagea minutiflora</h1>
<p>Gagea minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in woodland or open meadow habitats. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale blue, bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural environment.</p>
<p>Gagea minutiflora is also notable for its underground bulb-like structures, which store nutrients and help it survive in harsh conditions.</p>
