<p>Glycine gilletii, commonly known as the desert bean, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. Glycine gilletii is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
