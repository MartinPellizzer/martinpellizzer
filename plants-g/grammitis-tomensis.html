                    <h1>Grammitis tomensis</h1>
<p>Grammitis tomensis, commonly known as the Tom's spore moss, is a member of the family Hypnaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>This epiphytic fern typically grows on tree trunks and branches, forming dense, carpet-like mats. Its fronds are narrow, linear, and often have a dark green color with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Grammitis tomensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
