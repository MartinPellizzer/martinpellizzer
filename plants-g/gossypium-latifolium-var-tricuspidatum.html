                    <h1>Gossypium latifolium var. tricuspidatum</h1>
<p>Gossypium latifolium var. tricuspidatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf cotton or tricuspidate cotton, is a variant of the cotton plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and distinctive three-lobed leaflets, which give it its specific epithet "tricuspidatum.". The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are harvested for textile use, similar to other cotton species. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its unique morphological traits and potential for genetic diversity.</p>
