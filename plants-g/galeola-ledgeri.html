                    <h1>Galeola ledgeri</h1>
<p>Galeola ledgeri, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom during the winter months, typically between June and August. The plant has a compact growth habit with dark green, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow with a distinctive red or purple lip, which helps in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galeola ledgeri is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
