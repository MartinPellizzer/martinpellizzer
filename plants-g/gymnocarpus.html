<p>Gymnocarpus, commonly known as the naked fruit plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their simple, usually alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruits are typically naked, meaning they lack a fleshy outer covering, and are often dry and woody. Gymnocarpus species are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded or moist environments.</p>
<p>They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value.</p>
