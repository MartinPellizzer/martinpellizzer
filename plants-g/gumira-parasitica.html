                    <h1>Gumira parasitica</h1>
<p>Gumira parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic gumira, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which means it cannot perform photosynthesis. The plant typically attaches itself to the roots of other plants, such as trees or shrubs, through specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
