                    <h1>Gregoria nivalis</h1>
<p>Gregoria nivalis, commonly known as the snowstar, is a rare alpine plant found in high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves that help protect it from cold temperatures. Gregoria nivalis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires a specific microclimate to thrive.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
