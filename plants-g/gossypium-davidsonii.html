<p>Gossypium davidsonii, commonly known as the Davidson's cotton, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, woolly leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are similar to cotton but are not typically used for commercial purposes. It thrives in arid, rocky environments and is adapted to the unique climate of Socotra.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
