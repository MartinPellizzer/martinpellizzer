<p>Grammitis sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim chain fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
