                    <h1>Gyminda grisebachii</h1>
<p>Gyminda grisebachii, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots often forming a dense, tangled network in the mossy substrates of its habitat. Gyminda grisebachii is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments, relying on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
