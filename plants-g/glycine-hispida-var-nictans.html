<p>Glycine hispida var. nictans, commonly known as the moonflower or night bloomer, is a climbing legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its tendrils, which are sensitive to touch. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and close by morning, a trait that gives it its common name. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
