<p>Genista tomentella, commonly known as the woolly broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, leathery pods. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Genista tomentella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
