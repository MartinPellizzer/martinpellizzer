<p>Geesinkorchis quadricarinata, commonly known as the four-ribbed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
