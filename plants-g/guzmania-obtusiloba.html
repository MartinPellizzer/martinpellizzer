<p>Guzmania obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a flame. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, which helps collect and retain water. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Guzmania obtusiloba is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
