                    <h1>Guzmania xipholepis</h1>
<p>Guzmania xipholepis, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that collect water, creating a natural reservoir for its epiphytic growth. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Guzmania xipholepis is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
