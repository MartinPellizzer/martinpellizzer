<p>Gagea stenopetala subsp.</p>
<p>schreberi, commonly known as the Schreber's spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
