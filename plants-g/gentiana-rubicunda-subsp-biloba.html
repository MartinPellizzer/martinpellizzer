<p>Gentiana rubicunda subsp.</p>
<p>biloba, commonly known as the red gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The subspecies biloba is distinguished by its bifurcated (two-lobed) petals, a feature that sets it apart from other gentian species.</p>
