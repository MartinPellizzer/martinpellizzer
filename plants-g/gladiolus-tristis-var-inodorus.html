                    <h1>Gladiolus tristis var. inodorus</h1>
<p>Gladiolus tristis var. inodorus, commonly known as the scentless gladiolus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers, though the varietal name "inodorus" suggests a lack of scent. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
