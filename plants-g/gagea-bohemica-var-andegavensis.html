<p>Gagea bohemica var. andegavensis, commonly known as the Bohemian spring beauty, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant during unfavorable conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Gagea bohemica.</p>
