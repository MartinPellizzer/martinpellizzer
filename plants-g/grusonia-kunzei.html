                    <h1>Grusonia kunzei</h1>
<p>Grusonia kunzei, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has fibrous roots that help it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. Grusonia kunzei blooms in the spring and is often found in rocky soils or along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
