                    <h1>Gaultheria suborbicularis</h1>
<p>Gaultheria suborbicularis, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry shrub, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically elliptical or suborbicular in shape, hence the species name, and are covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are similar in taste to true strawberries.</p>
