                <h1>Galatella sedifolia</h1>
<p>Galatella sedifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy, green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, seed-filled stems that resemble a dandelion's "puffball.". Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Galatella sedifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
