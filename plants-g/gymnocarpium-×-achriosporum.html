                    <h1>Gymnocarpium × achriosporum</h1>
<p>Gymnocarpium × achriosporum, commonly known as the hybrid barren bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true fruits, as it produces small, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for underwater photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
