<p>Goniophlebium acuminatum, commonly known as the slender liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and covered in tiny, water-repellent dots. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Goniophlebium acuminatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
