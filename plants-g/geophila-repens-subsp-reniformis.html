<p>Geophila repens subsp.</p>
<p>reniformis, commonly known as the kidneyleaf geophila, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its natural habitat.</p>
