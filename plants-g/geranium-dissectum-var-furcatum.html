<p>Geranium dissectum var. furcatum, commonly known as the cutleaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, deeply lobed leaves that give it its "dissectum" designation, with the "furcatum" variety distinguished by its branching leaf veins. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
