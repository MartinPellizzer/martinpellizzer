<p>Gentiana pseudosquarrosa subsp.</p>
<p>pseudosquarrosa, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
