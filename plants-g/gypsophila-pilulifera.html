                    <h1>Gypsophila pilulifera</h1>
<p>Gypsophila pilulifera, commonly known as the cushion gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth form, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in rockeries and alpine settings.</p>
