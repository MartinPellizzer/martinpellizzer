<p>Galium verum var. hallasanense, commonly known as the Hallasan goldenweed, is a variant of the common bedstraw found in the high-altitude regions of Jeju Island, South Korea.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and a tendency to form dense mats on rocky or grassy slopes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>
