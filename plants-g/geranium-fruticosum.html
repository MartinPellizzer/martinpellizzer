                    <h1>Geranium fruticosum</h1>
<p>Geranium fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Geranium fruticosum is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
