                    <h1>Goniopteris fraseri</h1>
<p>Goniopteris fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Goniopteris fraseri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
