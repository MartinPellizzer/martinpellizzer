<p>Glossorhyncha acicularis, commonly known as the needleleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
