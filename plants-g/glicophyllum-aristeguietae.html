                    <h1>Glicophyllum aristeguietae</h1>
<p>Glicophyllum aristeguietae, commonly known as the Patagonian lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in the arid regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a dense, leathery layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange, with a finely granular texture, and it lacks distinct lobes. It is chemically distinct, containing unique secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
