<p>Galactia pilosa var. macreei, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is used in some ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
