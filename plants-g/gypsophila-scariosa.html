                    <h1>Gypsophila scariosa</h1>
<p>Gypsophila scariosa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gypsophila scariosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
