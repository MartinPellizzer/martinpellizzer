<p>Grammitis stanleyana, commonly known as Stanley's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Grammitis stanleyana is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
