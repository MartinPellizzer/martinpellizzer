                    <h1>Goniopteris nephrodioides</h1>
<p>Goniopteris nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This fern is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
