<p>Gahnia kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, low-lying areas such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Gahnia kauaiensis is an important component of Hawaii's native wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts.</p>
