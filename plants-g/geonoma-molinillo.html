<p>Geonoma molinillo, commonly known as the "molinillo fern," is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
