<p>Geniostoma macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it can efficiently capture small insects and crustaceans. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for floating and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Geniostoma macgregorii plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic environments.</p>
