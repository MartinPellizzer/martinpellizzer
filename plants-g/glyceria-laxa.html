<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Glyceria laxa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of wildlife.</p>
