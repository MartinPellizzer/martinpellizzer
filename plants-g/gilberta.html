                    <h1>Gilberta</h1>
<p>Gilberta, commonly known as the "flower of the desert," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Gilberta species are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plants typically grow from a basal rosette and produce small, inconspicuous fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance, they are often used in xeriscaping and as ornamental plants in dry climates.</p>
