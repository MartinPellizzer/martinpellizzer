<p>Grammitis pubipes, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate.</p>
<p>Grammitis pubipes thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
