                    <h1>Grammitis</h1>
<p>Grammitis, commonly known as rock ferns, are a diverse group of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their small, delicate fronds that often grow on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have a short, creeping rhizome and produce spores in clusters on the undersides of their leaves. Grammitis species are often found in shaded, humid environments and are adapted to nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Their unique growth habits and morphological features make them important components of forest ecosystems.</p>
