                    <h1>Glechoma curvidens</h1>
<p>Glechoma curvidens, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive scalloped edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Glechoma curvidens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread quickly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in gardens.</p>
