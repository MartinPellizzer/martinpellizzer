                    <h1>Gothofreda arnottiana</h1>
<p>Gothofreda arnottiana, commonly known as the Arnott's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the trunks and branches of trees without deriving nutrients from its host. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often hidden among the dense foliage of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Gothofreda arnottiana is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
