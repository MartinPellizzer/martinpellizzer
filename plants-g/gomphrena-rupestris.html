<p>Gomphrena rupestris, commonly known as the rock gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which are often used in dried flower arrangements. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gomphrena rupestris is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
