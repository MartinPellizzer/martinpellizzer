                    <h1>Gymnosphaera obliqua</h1>
<p>Gymnosphaera obliqua, commonly known as the twisted pine, is a rare gymnosperm native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted trunk and conical shape, which helps it withstand strong winds. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and male and female cones, typical of coniferous species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
