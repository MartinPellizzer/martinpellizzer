<p>Gaertnera belumutensis, commonly known as the Borneo ironwood, is a rare and endangered tree species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
