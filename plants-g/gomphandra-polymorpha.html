                    <h1>Gomphandra polymorpha</h1>
<p>Gomphandra polymorpha, commonly known as the variable gomphandra, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions. Its morphological variability, including differences in leaf shape and flower structure, has led to its common name and has made it a subject of taxonomic interest.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gomphandra polymorpha is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
