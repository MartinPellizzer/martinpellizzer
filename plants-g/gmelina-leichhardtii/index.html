<p>Gmelina tree, scientifically known as Gmelina leichhardtii, is a fast-growing tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is widely cultivated for its high-quality timber and its ability to thrive in various soil conditions. The tree is also valued for its ecological benefits, including soil stabilization and carbon sequestration. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine, and its flowers attract pollinators, supporting biodiversity. Despite its many advantages, the Gmelina tree faces challenges such as pests and overharvesting, making sustainable management essential for its future.</p>
