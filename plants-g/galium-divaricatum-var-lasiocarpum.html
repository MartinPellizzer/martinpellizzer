<p>Galium divaricatum var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, ascending stems that often branch near the base, covered with fine, soft hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly hairy surface. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, hairy capsule that dehisces to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats.</p>
