                    <h1>Geocaryum divaricatum</h1>
<p>Geocaryum divaricatum, commonly known as the slender swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, muddy soils along the edges of swamps, rivers, and other moist environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Geocaryum divaricatum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
