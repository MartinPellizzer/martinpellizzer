<p>Gymnogramma ceratolepis var. atirrensis, commonly known as the Atirrense Shield Fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Gymnogramma.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a compact rosette of lanceolate, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, shield-like appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is valued for its ornamental foliage in humid, shaded gardens.</p>
