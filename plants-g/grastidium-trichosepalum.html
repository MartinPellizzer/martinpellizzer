<p>Grastidium trichosepalum, commonly known as the three-lobed sandwort, is a small, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it has a shallow root system that helps it anchor in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Grastidium trichosepalum is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
