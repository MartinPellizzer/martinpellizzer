                    <h1>Gonzalagunia coccocypselum</h1>
<p>Gonzalagunia coccocypselum, commonly known as the red-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its smooth, green, evergreen leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are adapted for bird dispersal, as the fruits are not edible for humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique relationship with host trees and reliance on birds for seed dispersal make it an important component of its ecological community.</p>
