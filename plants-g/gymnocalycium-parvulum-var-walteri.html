                    <h1>Gymnocalycium parvulum var. walteri</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium parvulum var. walteri, commonly known as the Walter's moon cactus, is a low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
