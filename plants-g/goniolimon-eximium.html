<p>Goniolimon eximium, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typically small aquatic invertebrates. This plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself with its root system. Its flowers are usually small and pale, often appearing in clusters, and it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Goniolimon eximium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to the food web.</p>
