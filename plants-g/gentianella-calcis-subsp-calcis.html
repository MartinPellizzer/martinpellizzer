<p>Gentianella calcis subsp.</p>
<p>calcis, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and limestone habitats in Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded locations.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is known for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
