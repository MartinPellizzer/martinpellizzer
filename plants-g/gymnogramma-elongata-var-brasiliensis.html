<p>Gymnogramma elongata var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian kidney fern, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that give it a distinctive, almost kidney-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates like soil or rock.</p>
