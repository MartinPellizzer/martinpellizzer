<p>Geonoma pohliana subsp.</p>
<p>linharensis, commonly known as the Linharense fern, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its pinnate, lanceolate leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in forming dense clumps, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
