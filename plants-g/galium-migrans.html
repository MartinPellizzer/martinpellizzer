                    <h1>Galium migrans</h1>
<p>Galium migrans, commonly known as creeping woodsorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white V-shaped marking. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Galium migrans is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
