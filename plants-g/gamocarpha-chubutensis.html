                    <h1>Gamocarpha chubutensis</h1>
<p>Gamocarpha chubutensis, commonly known as the Chubut thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, spiny foliage that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, waxy leaves reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Gamocarpha chubutensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
