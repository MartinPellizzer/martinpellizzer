                    <h1>Gasteranthus panamensis</h1>
<p>Gasteranthus panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian lantern flower, is a strikingly unique plant native to the humid forests of Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful, lantern-like flowers that resemble small, inflated fruits. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a fleshy, chambered structure that attracts specific pollinators such as beetles and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gasteranthus panamensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
