<p>Gagea foliosa subsp.</p>
<p>nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebrodensis spring beauty, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbous structure allows it to survive harsh winter conditions and regenerate in the following growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
