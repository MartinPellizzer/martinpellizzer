                    <h1>Grammitis katasophistes</h1>
<p>Grammitis katasophistes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
