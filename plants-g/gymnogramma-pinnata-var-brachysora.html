                    <h1>Gymnogramma pinnata var. brachysora</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma pinnata var. brachysora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical variety. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of the leaflets. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
