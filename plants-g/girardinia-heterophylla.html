                <h1>Girardinia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Girardinia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with fronds that can be either pinnate or bipinnate depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Girardinia heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
