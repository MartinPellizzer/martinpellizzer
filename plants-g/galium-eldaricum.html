<p>Galium eldaricum, commonly known as the elf's sapphire or fairy sapphire, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue-green foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Galium eldaricum is also noted for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
