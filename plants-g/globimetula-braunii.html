<p>Globimetula braunii, commonly known as the Braun's globular liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct, rounded thallus that is often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>Globimetula braunii is an important component of microhabitats in temperate and tropical regions, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
