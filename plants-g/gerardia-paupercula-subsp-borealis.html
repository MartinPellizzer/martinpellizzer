                    <h1>Gerardia paupercula subsp. borealis</h1>
<p>Gerardia paupercula subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the Arctic gerardia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic tundra. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils, thriving in the harsh conditions of the circumpolar regions. Its growth is slow, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local insect populations.</p>
<p>The plant is an important indicator species for assessing the health of Arctic ecosystems.</p>
