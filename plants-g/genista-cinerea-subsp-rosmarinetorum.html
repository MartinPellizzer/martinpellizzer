<p>Genista cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>rosmarinetorum, commonly known as the silver broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
