<p>Glyceria maxima var. grandis, commonly known as the tall glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
