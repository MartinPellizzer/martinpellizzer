                    <h1>Gymnogramma totta var. mollissima</h1>
<p>Gymnogramma totta var. mollissima, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive tactile quality. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are pinnately divided and often have a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in rows.</p>
