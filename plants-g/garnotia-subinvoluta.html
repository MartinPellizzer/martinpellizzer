<p>Garnotia subinvoluta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens across the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
