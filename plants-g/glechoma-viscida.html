                    <h1>Glechoma viscida</h1>
<p>Glechoma viscida, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can colonize moist, shady areas.</p>
<p>Glechoma viscida is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings.</p>
