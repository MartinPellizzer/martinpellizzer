<p>Gonolobus virescens, commonly known as the green antelope plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually green or slightly glaucous. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a faintly scented aroma. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense foliage make it both a decorative and potentially invasive species in certain environments.</p>
