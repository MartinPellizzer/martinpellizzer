                    <h1>Gymnopetalum scabrum var. penicaudii</h1>
<p>Gymnopetalum scabrum var. penicaudii, commonly known as the rough scabrous bellflower, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, rough hairs, contributing to its common name. This variant is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
