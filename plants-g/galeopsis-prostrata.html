<p>Galeopsis prostrata, commonly known as creeping hedge-nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, two-lobed capsule that splits open when mature.</p>
<p>Galeopsis prostrata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
