                <h1>Gentiana nudicaulis</h1>
<p>Gentiana nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Gentiana nudicaulis is often considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
