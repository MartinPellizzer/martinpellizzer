                    <h1>Galega pumila</h1>
<p>Galega pumila, commonly known as the creeping goat's rue, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can become quite extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Galega pumila is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies.</p>
