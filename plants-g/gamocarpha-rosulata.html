                    <h1>Gamocarpha rosulata</h1>
<p>Gamocarpha rosulata, commonly known as the rosette dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that form a compact structure. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gamocarpha rosulata is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
