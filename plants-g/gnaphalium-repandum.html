<p>Gnaphalium repandum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are surrounded by pale green to white bracts. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium repandum is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
