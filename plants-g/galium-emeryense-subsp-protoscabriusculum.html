<p>Galium emeryense subsp.</p>
<p>protoscabriusculum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, typically ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly rough texture. This subspecies thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in such regions.</p>
