<p>Gymnogramma calomelanos var. denudata, commonly known as the naked leaf gymnogramma, is a variant of the gymnogramma genus native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often have a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive, finely toothed margin.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
