                    <h1>Gastrodia holttumii</h1>
<p>Gastrodia holttumii, commonly known as the hill ginger or mountain orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces small, fleshy, yellowish-brown capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically found in forested mountain regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
