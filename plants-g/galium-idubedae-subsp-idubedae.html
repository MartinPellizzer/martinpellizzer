<p>Galium idubedae subsp.</p>
<p>idubedae, commonly known as the Idubede bedstraw, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in terminal racemes. It is native to specific regions in Africa, particularly Ethiopia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
