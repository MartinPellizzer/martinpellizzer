                    <h1>Glyptopetalum reticulinerve</h1>
<p>Glyptopetalum reticulinerve, commonly known as the reticulate-veined rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, hairy foliage and intricate, reticulate venation pattern on its leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with a unique structure, often featuring a spurred lip that is adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
