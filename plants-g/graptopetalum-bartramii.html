                    <h1>Graptopetalum bartramii</h1>
<p>Graptopetalum bartramii, commonly known as the Bartram's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the spring and early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Graptopetalum bartramii is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
