                    <h1>Gymnospermium kiangnanensis</h1>
<p>Gymnospermium kiangnanensis, commonly known as the Kiangnan cycad, is a unique gymnosperm native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
