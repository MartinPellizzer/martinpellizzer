<p>Graellsia hederifolia, commonly known as the ivy-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that resemble those of ivy, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
