                            <h1>Galium Cassium F. Calvescens</h1>
<p>Common bedstraw, scientifically known as Galium cassium f. calvescens, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems, small white or pinkish flowers, and opposite leaves that are often hairy to the touch. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense mats. Its delicate appearance and subtle fragrance make it a subtle yet notable presence in natural habitats. Despite its modest size, Common bedstraw plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
