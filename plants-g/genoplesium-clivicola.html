<p>Genoplesium clivicola, commonly known as the cliff lily, is a rare and striking orchid native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along cliffs and coastal dunes, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often appearing in dense rosettes at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Genoplesium clivicola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
