                    <h1>Glyceria torreyana</h1>
<p>Glyceria torreyana, commonly known as Torrey's glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Glyceria torreyana plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and waterfowl.</p>
