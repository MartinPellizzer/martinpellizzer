                    <h1>Gastrocotyle</h1>
<p>Gastrocotyle, commonly known as the sea hare, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and the absence of a shell, which distinguishes it from many other sea snails. These organisms are typically found in warm, shallow coastal waters and are known for their ability to secrete a variety of bioactive compounds. Gastrocotyle species often have a distinct, elongated body shape with a muscular foot used for locomotion.</p>
<p>Their reproductive systems are complex, with separate sexes and a unique method of external fertilization.</p>
