<p>Glossonema lineare, commonly known as the linear leaf liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the soil surface in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Glossonema lineare plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other small organisms.</p>
