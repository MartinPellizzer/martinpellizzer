                    <h1>Gourmania</h1>
<p>Gourmania, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, yellow, and orange. The leaves are typically narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, a feature essential for survival in harsh environments. Gourmania species are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>They play an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
