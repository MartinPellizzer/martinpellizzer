                    <h1>Gothofreda birostrata</h1>
<p>Gothofreda birostrata, commonly known as the twin-beaked orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated flower spikes that bear two prominent, beak-like structures. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern, while the roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging plant to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gothofreda birostrata is considered a conservation concern.</p>
