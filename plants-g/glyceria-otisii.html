                    <h1>Glyceria otisii</h1>
<p>Glyceria otisii, commonly known as the slender glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, exhibiting a rhizomatous growth habit that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant produces slender, cylindrical stems with narrow leaves, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often submerged or floating. Glyceria otisii plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions makes it an important indicator species for wetland health.</p>
