<p>Grammitis copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's spikemoss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperjiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, cone-like formations at the tips of the leaves.</p>
<p>Grammitis copelandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings where a lush, green understory is desired.</p>
