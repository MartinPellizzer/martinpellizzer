<p>Glomera diosmoides, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically small and grayish-green, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Glomera diosmoides is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
