                    <h1>Glossopteris</h1>
<p>Glossopteris, commonly known as the "tongue fern," is an extinct genus of seed plants that thrived during the late Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, tongue-shaped leaves that were often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. Glossopteris plants were primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, and they played a significant role in the ancient flora of Gondwana. The plant's structure suggests it was a large, tree-like organism with a complex vascular system.</p>
<p>Fossilized remains of Glossopteris provide important insights into the evolution of early seed plants and the paleoenvironment of prehistoric Earth.</p>
