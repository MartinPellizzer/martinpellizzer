<p>Guillandinodes capitatum, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its striking, golden-yellow fronds that contrast beautifully with its dark green base. The plant features small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Guillandinodes capitatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
