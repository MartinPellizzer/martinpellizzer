                    <h1>Gonzalea brachyantha</h1>
<p>Gonzalea brachyantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gonzalea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Gonzalea brachyantha is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
