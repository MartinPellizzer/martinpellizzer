                    <h1>Gastrodia hasseltii</h1>
<p>Gastrodia hasseltii, commonly known as the African ginseng, is a parasitic plant belonging to the orchid family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of trees or shrubs. The plant produces a unique, tubular structure called a pseudobulb, which stores nutrients and water. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated for its potential health benefits.</p>
