<p>Grahamia vulcanensis, commonly known as the Vulcan's flame, is a striking plant native to the volcanic regions of the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, characterized by its vivid red and orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soil and has adapted to the extreme conditions of its environment. Its unique morphology includes a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ability to bloom in response to specific environmental cues, such as temperature changes.</p>
