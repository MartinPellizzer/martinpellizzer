<p>Gossypium hirsutum var. religiosum, commonly known as the sacred cotton, is a variety of upland cotton native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, fluffy seeds that are often associated with religious and ceremonial practices among indigenous communities. The plant produces bright yellow flowers and has a hairy stem, typical of the Gossypium genus. Its fibers are valued not only for their textile properties but also for their cultural and spiritual significance.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated commercially compared to other cotton types due to its limited yield and specific growing requirements.</p>
