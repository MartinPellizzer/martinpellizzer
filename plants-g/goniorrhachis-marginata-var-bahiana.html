<p>Goniorrhachis marginata var. bahiana, commonly known as the Bahian fern, is a tropical species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This rare and visually striking plant is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its ecological significance and limited distribution.</p>
