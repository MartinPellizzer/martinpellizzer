                    <h1>Gossypium gossypioides</h1>
<p>Gossypium gossypioides, commonly known as wild cotton, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, featuring woody stems and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy bolls that contain fibers similar to those of cultivated cotton, though it is not widely used for commercial textile production. It is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its role in genetic research due to its close relationship with domesticated cotton varieties.</p>
