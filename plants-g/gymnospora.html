                    <h1>Gymnospora</h1>
<p>Gymnospora, commonly known as the "naked seed plant," is a group of seed plants that do not produce flowers or fruits.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their naked seeds, which are not enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosporas typically have needle-like or scale-like leaves and are often found in temperate or cold climates. They include well-known species such as pines, firs, and spruces.</p>
<p>The botanical study of gymnosporas is important for understanding plant evolution and ecological roles in various ecosystems.</p>
