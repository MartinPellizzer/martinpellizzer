<p>Goniophlebium raishaense, commonly known as the Raisha fern, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Goniophlebium raishaense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
