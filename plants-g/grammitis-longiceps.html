<p>Grammitis longiceps, commonly known as the long-headed spikemoss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-producing clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Grammitis longiceps plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
