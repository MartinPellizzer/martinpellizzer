<p>Goniophlebium anisomeron, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
