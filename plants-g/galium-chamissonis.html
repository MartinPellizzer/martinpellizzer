<p>Galium chamissonis, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring.
