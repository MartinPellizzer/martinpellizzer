                    <h1>Grastidium cucullitepalum</h1>
<p>Grastidium cucullitepalum, commonly known as the hooded sunspire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-like petals that range in color from deep violet to bright orange. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that contain edible seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Botanists classify it within the family Cucurbitaceae, though its unique morphology has led to ongoing taxonomic debate.</p>
