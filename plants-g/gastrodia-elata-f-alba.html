                    <h1>Gastrodia elata f. alba</h1>
<p>Gastrodia elata f. alba, commonly known as the white-stemmed tuckahoe, is a rare and highly valued orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often twisted stems that are covered in a dense, white or pale-colored mycorrhizal sheath. The plant is an epiparasite, relying on the roots of certain trees for nutrients and water. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, and its tuberous rhizomes are prized in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
