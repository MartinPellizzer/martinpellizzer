                    <h1>Gymnocalycium lafaldense f. hossei</h1>
<p>Gymnocalycium lafaldense f. hossei, commonly known as the Hosse's moon cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, globular stem that is typically green or bluish-green, with a thick, fleshy texture adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are often short-lived but striking in appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This succulent is well-suited to dry, sunny environments and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
