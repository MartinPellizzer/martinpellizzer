<p>Gymnocalycium fricianum, commonly known as the Frician moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and smooth, greenish-gray stem covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range from yellow to orange in color, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Gymnocalycium fricianum is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
