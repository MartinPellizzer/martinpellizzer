                    <h1>Glyphotaenium trifurcatum</h1>
<p>Glyphotaenium trifurcatum, commonly known as the three-branch fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that split into three main branches, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
