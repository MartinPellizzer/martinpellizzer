                    <h1>Glycocystis beckeri</h1>
<p>Glycocystis beckeri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, white, waxy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, as it lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Glycocystis beckeri is considered critically endangered in many regions.</p>
