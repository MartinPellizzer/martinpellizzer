<p>Gomphocarpus tomentosus subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels. It is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and savannas.</p>
<p>The milky sap it exudes is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
