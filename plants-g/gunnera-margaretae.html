                    <h1>Gunnera margaretae</h1>
<p>Gunnera margaretae, commonly known as the Andes giant water shield, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in diameter. The plant thrives in moist, high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests or near water sources. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
