<p>Grastidium pergracile, commonly known as the slender ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Grastidium pergracile is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
