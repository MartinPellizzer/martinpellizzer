                    <h1>Gymnosphaera rouhaniana</h1>
<p>Gymnosphaera rouhaniana, commonly known as the Rouhan's gymnosphaera, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Podostomata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a flattened, leaf-like structure that often grows directly on submerged rocks in fast-flowing streams. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, instead relying on its specialized structures for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures are highly adapted to aquatic environments, with small, spore-producing organs that release gametes into the water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Gymnosphaera rouhaniana is considered an important indicator species for freshwater ecosystems.</p>
