                    <h1>Gratiola peruviana var. uliginosa</h1>
<p>Gratiola peruviana var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog geranium, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to retain moisture in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and capable of storing nutrients, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>The species is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
