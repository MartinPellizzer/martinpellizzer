<p>Geraniospermum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny geraniosperm, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its adaptations to drought and heat make it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Geraniospermum spinosum is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in local horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
