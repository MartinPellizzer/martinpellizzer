                    <h1>Geissaspis bifoliolata</h1>
<p>Geissaspis bifoliolata, commonly known as the two-leafed geissaspis, is a rare and unique member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring two small, lobed leaves at the base of each stem. The plant produces striking tubular flowers that are typically a vivid shade of red or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
