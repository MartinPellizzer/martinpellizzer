                    <h1>Gormania hallii</h1>
<p>Gormania hallii, commonly known as the Hall's gormania, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gormania hallii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
