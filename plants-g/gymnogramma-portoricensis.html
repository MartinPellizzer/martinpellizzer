<p>Gymnogramma portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican sword fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Gymnogramma portoricensis plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
