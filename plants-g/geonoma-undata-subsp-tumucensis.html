<p>Geonoma undata subsp.</p>
<p>tumucensis, commonly known as the Tumucensis fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, velvety moss, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
