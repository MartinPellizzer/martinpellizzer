                    <h1>Gagea praemixta</h1>
<p>Gagea praemixta, commonly known as the mixed gagea, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon, where it grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its bulbs are clustered and often covered in a thin, papery sheath, which helps protect them during dormancy.</p>
<p>Gagea praemixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
