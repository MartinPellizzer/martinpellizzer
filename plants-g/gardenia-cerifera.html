                    <h1>Gardenia cerifera</h1>
<p>Gardenia cerifera, commonly known as the wax gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage and fragrant, waxy white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its dense, compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for hedges or container gardening.</p>
<p>Gardenia cerifera prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
