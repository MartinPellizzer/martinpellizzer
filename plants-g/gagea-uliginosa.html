<p>Gagea uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh gagea, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the top of its stems. Its bulbs are small and often clustered, adapted for survival in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
