<p>Gymnogramma dobraydense, commonly known as the Dobrayd's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. Gymnogramma dobraydense is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
