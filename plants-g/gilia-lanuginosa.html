<p>Gilia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Gilia lanuginosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
