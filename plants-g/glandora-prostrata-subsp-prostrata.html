<p>Glandora prostrata subsp.</p>
<p>prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate glandora, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to parts of southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
