                    <h1>Gastrodia sabahensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia sabahensis, commonly known as the Sabah orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often tuberous structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in a spike.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly vulnerable to extinction.</p>
