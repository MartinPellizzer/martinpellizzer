<p>Glossopetalon spinescens var. aridum, commonly known as the spiny glossopetalon, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, spiny stems that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to enhance water retention. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
