                            <h1>Galium Claytonii Var. Subbiflorum</h1>
<p>Clayton's bedstraw, scientifically known as Galium claytonii var. subbiflorum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. This plant is characterized by its slender stems, small white flowers, and heart-shaped leaves that grow in whorls along its stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Clayton's bedstraw is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
