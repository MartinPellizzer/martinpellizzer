<p>Gymnodes sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic Gymnodes, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions, particularly in the Sudetes range of Central Europe. Its habitat is limited, making it a species of conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, Gymnodes sudetica is often found in shaded, humid microhabitats within forested areas.</p>
