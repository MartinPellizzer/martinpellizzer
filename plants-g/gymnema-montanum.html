                    <h1>Gymnema montanum</h1>
<p>Gymnema montanum, commonly known as the Indian bitter apple, is a climbing plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its unique ability to suppress the taste of sweetness, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. Its fruits are small, green berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Gymnema montanum is also valued in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
