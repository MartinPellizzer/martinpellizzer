<p>Gymnadeniopsis clavellata var. ophioglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adder's tongue, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ophioglossaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves and small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a unique, elongated shape that sets it apart from other ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
