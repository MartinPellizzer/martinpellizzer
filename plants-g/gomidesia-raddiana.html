<p>Gomidesia raddiana, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Gomidesia raddiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
