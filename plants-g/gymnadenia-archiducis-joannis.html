<p>Gymnadenia archiducis-joannis, commonly known as the Archduke's grass-of-Parnassus, is a rare and endangered species of orchid native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a single, showy white or pale pink flower that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous habitats at high altitudes. Gymnadenia archiducis-joannis is closely related to other members of the Orchidaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and pollination mechanisms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
