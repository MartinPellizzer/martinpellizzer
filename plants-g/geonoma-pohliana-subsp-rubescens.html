<p>Geonoma pohliana subsp.</p>
<p>rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that often have a reddish tint along the veins.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
