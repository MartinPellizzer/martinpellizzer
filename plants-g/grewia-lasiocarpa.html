                    <h1>Grewia lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Grewia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the rough-haired bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid regions.</p>
