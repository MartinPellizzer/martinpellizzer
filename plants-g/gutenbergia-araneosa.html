<p>Gutenbergia araneosa, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in wetland habitats. The plant is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin leaves and a single, intricate flower that resembles a web. Its flowers are typically green or brownish in color, with a distinctive, complex structure that aids in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Gutenbergia araneosa is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
