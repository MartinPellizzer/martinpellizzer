<p>Gynochthodes australiensis, commonly known as the Australian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it contributes to biodiversity and is often found in forested areas.</p>
