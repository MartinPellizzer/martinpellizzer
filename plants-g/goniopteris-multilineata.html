                    <h1>Goniopteris multilineata</h1>
<p>Goniopteris multilineata, commonly known as the multi-lined water fern, is a prehistoric fern that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds with a distinctive multi-lined structure along the veins. The plant's leaves were typically bipinnate, with multiple layers of pinnae that contributed to its overall complexity. It was an important component of the ancient swamp ecosystems, playing a role in the formation of coal deposits.</p>
<p>Its fossilized remains provide valuable insights into the paleobotany of the Carboniferous period.</p>
