                    <h1>Gnaphalium spinosum</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium spinosum, commonly known as the spiny cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has spiny or hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs that contribute to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium spinosum is often found in disturbed soils, rocky areas, and along roadsides, where it thrives in poor, well-drained conditions.</p>
