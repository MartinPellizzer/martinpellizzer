                    <h1>Ginkgo biloba var. variegata</h1>
<p>Ginkgo biloba var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated ginkgo, is a variant of the ginkgo tree known for its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically fan-shaped and exhibit a striking variegation pattern, with a mix of yellow, green, and sometimes white or cream-colored patches. This variation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in the unique coloration. The tree is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and urban landscapes.</p>
