<p>Goniophlebium latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are usually broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinct midrib and a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Goniophlebium latifrons plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
