<p>Galium mite var. roseum, commonly known as the roseum wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its close relation to other species in the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenia.</p>
