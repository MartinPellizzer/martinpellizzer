<p>Galium aparine var. agreste, commonly known as cleavers, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, opposite leaves with stiff, hooked hairs that aid in seed dispersal. The plant produces tiny white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when disturbed.</p>
<p>Cleavers are often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, fields, and woodland edges.</p>
