<p>Girtanneria frangula, commonly known as common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, black berries that are rich in anthraquinones. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
