<p>Grastidium dactylodes, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Grastidium dactylodes is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
