<p>Geboscon stenium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gescon, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, blooming during the early spring. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Geboscon stenium is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
