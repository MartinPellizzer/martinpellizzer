                    <h1>Gyrostachys aphylla</h1>
<p>Gyrostachys aphylla, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks true leaves and relies on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Africa and is typically found growing on the branches of trees such as acacia and eucalyptus. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its unique adaptation allows it to survive in nutrient-poor environments by tapping into the vascular system of its host.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habit, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native ecosystems.</p>
