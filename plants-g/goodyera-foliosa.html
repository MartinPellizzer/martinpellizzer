                    <h1>Goodyera foliosa</h1>
<p>Goodyera foliosa, commonly known as the miniature orchid or the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the trunks or branches of trees in the understory of forests. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, and it produces delicate, orchid-like flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Goodyera foliosa is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
