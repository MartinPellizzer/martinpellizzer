                    <h1>Gastrostylum</h1>
<p>Gastrostylum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its botanical features include a short, slender stem and a single, showy flower with three sepals and three petals.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gastrostylum is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
