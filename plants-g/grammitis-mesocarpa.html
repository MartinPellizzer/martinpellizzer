<p>Grammitis mesocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaf moss fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are embedded in the leaf surfaces, a feature typical of the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>Grammitis mesocarpa plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitats for small organisms.</p>
