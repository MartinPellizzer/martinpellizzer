                    <h1>Gaultheria elliptica</h1>
<p>Gaultheria elliptica, commonly known as the slender wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and often adorned with white or pinkish veins. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate.</p>
<p>Gaultheria elliptica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded woodland environments.</p>
