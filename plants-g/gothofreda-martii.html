                    <h1>Gothofreda martii</h1>
<p>Gothofreda martii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Gothofreda martii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
