<p>Gaylussacia jordanensis, commonly known as Jordan's huckleberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, acidic berries. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in the understory of hardwood or pine forests. Its flowers are white and clustered, and the berries are edible, though they are usually consumed by wildlife rather than humans.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
