                    <h1>Guarea duckei</h1>
<p>Guarea duckei, commonly known as the red sanders, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and dark, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overexploitation, Guarea duckei is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions.</p>
