<p>Grevillea integrifolia var. grandiflora, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its striking, bright orange or red flowers that appear in dense, cylindrical spikes. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
