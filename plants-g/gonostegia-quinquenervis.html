                    <h1>Gonostegia quinquenervis</h1>
<p>Gonostegia quinquenervis, commonly known as the five-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it relies on birds for seed dispersal. Its roots penetrate the stems of host trees, drawing nutrients and water from them.</p>
<p>This species is found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments.</p>
