                    <h1>Geissaspis cristata var. malabarica</h1>
<p>Geissaspis cristata var. malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar starling orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small, with a complex structure that includes a prominent lip, typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
