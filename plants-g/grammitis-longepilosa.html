<p>Grammitis longepilosa, commonly known as the long-haired fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Grammitis longepilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
