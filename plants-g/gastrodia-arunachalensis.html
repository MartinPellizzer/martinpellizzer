                    <h1>Gastrodia arunachalensis</h1>
<p>Gastrodia arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal ginseng, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a tuberous plant that produces a fleshy, yellowish underground stem known as a rhizome. The plant is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its rhizome for photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded forest environments at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
