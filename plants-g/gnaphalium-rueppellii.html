                    <h1>Gnaphalium rueppellii</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium rueppellii, commonly known as the desert cudweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium rueppellii is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
