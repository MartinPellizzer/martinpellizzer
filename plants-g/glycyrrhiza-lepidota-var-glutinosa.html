                    <h1>Glycyrrhiza lepidota var. glutinosa</h1>
<p>Glycyrrhiza lepidota var. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky licorice plant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The sticky substance on its stems is due to the presence of a resinous compound called viscin, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
