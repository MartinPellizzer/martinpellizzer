<p>Grammitis hombersleyi, commonly known as the Hombersley's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperjaniaceae and is characterized by its small, elongated leaves that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is a subject of conservation interest among botanists.</p>
