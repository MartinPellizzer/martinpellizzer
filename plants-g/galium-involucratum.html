<p>Galium involucratum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Galium involucratum is often found in moist environments such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
