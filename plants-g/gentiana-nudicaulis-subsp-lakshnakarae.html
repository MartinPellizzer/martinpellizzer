<p>Gentiana nudicaulis subsp.</p>
<p>lakshnakarae, commonly known as the Lakshnakara gentian, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in forested or open alpine habitats. Its narrow, upright stems support few leaves, with the majority of its foliage concentrated near the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
