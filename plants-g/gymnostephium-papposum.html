<p>Gymnostephium papposum, commonly known as the woolly leaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its distinctive feature is the presence of a tuft of white, silky hairs at the base of its leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
