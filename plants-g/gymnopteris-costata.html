<p>Gymnopteris costata, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Gymnopteris costata has a relatively simple life cycle, with a distinct sporophyte and gametophyte stage.</p>
