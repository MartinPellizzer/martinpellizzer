<p>Grammitis uluguruensis, commonly known as the Uluguru fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the Uluguru Mountains of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with small, closely packed leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rock surfaces or in moist forest understories. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, with a distinct midrib and a dense arrangement of tiny, overlapping leaflets.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
