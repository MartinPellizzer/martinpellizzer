                    <h1>Galium boreale var. hirsutum</h1>
<p>Galium boreale var. hirsutum, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, ascending stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks.</p>
<p>Its hairy leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
