                    <h1>Genlisea glabra</h1>
<p>Genlisea glabra, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are highly sensitive and can rapidly inflate to capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its leaves for both photosynthesis and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptive strategies make it an intriguing subject in the study of plant evolution and ecology.</p>
