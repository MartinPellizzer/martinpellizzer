                    <h1>Geranium rotundifolium var. barcinonense</h1>
<p>Geranium rotundifolium var. barcinonense, commonly known as the Barcino geranium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its botanical features include hairy stems and a compact growth habit, which help it adapt to its specialized environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
