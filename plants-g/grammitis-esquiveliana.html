                    <h1>Grammitis esquiveliana</h1>
<p>Grammitis esquiveliana, commonly known as the Esquivel's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps in moisture retention. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are small and clustered, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Grammitis esquiveliana is found primarily in Central and South America, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
