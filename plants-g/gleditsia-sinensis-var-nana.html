                    <h1>Gleditsia sinensis var. nana</h1>
<p>Gleditsia sinensis var. nana, commonly known as the Chinese honeylocust dwarf form, is a compact, ornamental tree or shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are smaller and more delicate than those of the standard honeylocust, with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are followed by slender, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It is well-suited for small gardens due to its slow growth and tolerance of urban conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture.</p>
