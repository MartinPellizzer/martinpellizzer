<p>Gymnadenia tridentata var. clavellata, commonly known as the clavellate lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, three- to five-branching inflorescence, which gives it the common name "lady's tresses.". The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a slight greenish tinge, and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The variety clavellata is distinguished by its shorter, more compact spikes and smaller flowers compared to the typical form.</p>
