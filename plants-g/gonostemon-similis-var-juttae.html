                    <h1>Gonostemon similis var. juttae</h1>
<p>Gonostemon similis var. juttae, commonly known as the Jutta's ghostplant, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that float just beneath the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its aquatic ecosystem.</p>
