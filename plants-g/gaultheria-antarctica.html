                    <h1>Gaultheria antarctica</h1>
<p>Gaultheria antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the summer. These berries are edible and contain a high concentration of methyl salicylate, which gives them their distinctive wintergreen scent.</p>
<p>Gaultheria antarctica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous and subantarctic regions.</p>
