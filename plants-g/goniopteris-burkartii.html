                    <h1>Goniopteris burkartii</h1>
<p>Goniopteris burkartii, commonly known as the Burkart's shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
