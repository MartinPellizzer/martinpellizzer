                    <h1>Gelidocalamus velutinus</h1>
<p>Gelidocalamus velutinus, commonly known as the velvet bamboo, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, soft, and silky foliage that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, contributing to its ecological significance in stabilizing soil in rocky terrains.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
