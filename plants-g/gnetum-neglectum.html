                    <h1>Gnetum neglectum</h1>
<p>Gnetum neglectum, commonly known as the African tropical gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, which includes gymnosperms.</p>
<p>It is a woody shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces seeds enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed structure, a feature that distinguishes it from typical gymnosperms.</p>
<p>Its vascular system includes a unique type of xylem with sieve-like structures, reflecting its evolutionary position between gymnosperms and angiosperms.</p>
