<p>Grastidium nhatrangense, commonly known as the Nhatrang ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the coastal regions of southern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near tidal zones, where it forms dense mats on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures are concealed within intricate, spore-bearing capsules, which are often difficult to detect without close inspection.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Grastidium nhatrangense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from coastal development and environmental degradation.</p>
