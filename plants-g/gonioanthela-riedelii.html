                    <h1>Gonioanthela riedelii</h1>
<p>Gonioanthela riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a delicate, epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in the summer months, and are pollinated by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, Gonioanthela riedelii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
