<p>Glicophyllum gracile, commonly known as the slender leathery lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a leathery texture and a distinct, often lobed structure. The plant typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a symbiotic association between algae and fungi.</p>
<p>Glicophyllum gracile is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
