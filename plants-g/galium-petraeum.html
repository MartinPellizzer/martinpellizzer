                    <h1>Galium petraeum</h1>
<p>Galium petraeum, commonly known as the rock bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It typically features slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Galium petraeum is often found in crevices and on cliffs, where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
