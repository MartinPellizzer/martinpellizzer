<p>Goniophlebium terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming moss-like plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil. The plant has a simple structure with leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures that perform similar functions.</p>
<p>Goniophlebium terrestre plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
