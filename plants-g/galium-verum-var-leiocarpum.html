                    <h1>Galium verum var. leiocarpum</h1>
<p>Galium verum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is notable for its pale yellow flowers, which are less intense than those of the typical Galium verum.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
