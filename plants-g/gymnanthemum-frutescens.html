<p>Gymnanthemum frutescens, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Gymnanthemum frutescens is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping.</p>
