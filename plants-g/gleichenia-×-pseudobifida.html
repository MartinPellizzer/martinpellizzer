                    <h1>Gleichenia × pseudobifida</h1>
<p>Gleichenia × pseudobifida, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gleichenia glabra and Gleichenia trichophylla.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure includes a rhizome with adventitious roots and two types of leaves: sterile and fertile.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
