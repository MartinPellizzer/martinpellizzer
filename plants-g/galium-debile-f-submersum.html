<p>Galium debile f. submersum, commonly known as the submerged bedstraw, is a rare aquatic variant of the bedstraw plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often submerged stems that grow in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant typically has small, opposite leaves that are usually submerged or partially submerged, adapted to its aquatic habitat. Its flowers are small and white, similar to those of its terrestrial relatives, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
