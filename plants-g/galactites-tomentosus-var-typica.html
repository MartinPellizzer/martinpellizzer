                    <h1>Galactites tomentosus var. typica</h1>
<p>Galactites tomentosus var. typica, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of white hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, though it serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
