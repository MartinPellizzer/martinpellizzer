<p>Gleichenia cryptocarpa, commonly known as the cryptic Gleichenia, is a fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and has lanceolate, often slightly curled fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
