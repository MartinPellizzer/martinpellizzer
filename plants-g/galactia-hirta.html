                    <h1>Galactia hirta</h1>
<p>Galactia hirta, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Galactia hirta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria.</p>
