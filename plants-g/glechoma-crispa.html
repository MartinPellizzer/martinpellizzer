                    <h1>Glechoma crispa</h1>
<p>Glechoma crispa, commonly known as Creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Glechoma crispa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated settings.</p>
