<p>Grammitis praeceps, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Grammitis praeceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
