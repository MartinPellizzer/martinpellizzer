<p>Gagea pamirica var. spitiensis, commonly known as the Spiti lily, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions of India and Nepal. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh climatic conditions, and it blooms during the short growing season in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
