<p>Gymnosporia emarginata, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Gymnosporia emarginata has adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
