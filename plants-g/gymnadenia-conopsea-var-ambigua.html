                    <h1>Gymnadenia conopsea var. ambigua</h1>
<p>Gymnadenia conopsea var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous goat's-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy meadows and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that release seeds through a unique mechanical mechanism.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Gymnadenia conopsea.</p>
