                    <h1>Gonzalagunia tonduzii</h1>
<p>Gonzalagunia tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduzii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to the subtropical regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>Gonzalagunia tonduzii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
