                    <h1>Girtanneria saxatilis</h1>
<p>Girtanneria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a cyanobacterium or green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant forms a crust-like growth that is typically pale green or yellowish in color. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in arid and alpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
