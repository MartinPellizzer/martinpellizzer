<p>Geerinckia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. Geerinckia species typically produce small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds.</p>
<p>These plants are often found in dry, open habitats and are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
