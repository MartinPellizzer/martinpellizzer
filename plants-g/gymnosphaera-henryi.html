<p>Gymnosphaera henryi, commonly known as the Henry's gymnosphaera, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pinaceae, which includes conifers, and is characterized by its distinctive cone-like structures. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, a feature typical of gymnosperms. Its leaves are needle-like and arranged in spirals, contributing to its adaptation to cold and arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Gymnosphaera henryi is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
