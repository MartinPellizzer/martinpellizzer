                            <h1>Glechoma Kokamirica</h1>
<p>Kokamiric glechoma, scientifically known as Glechoma kokamirica, is a lesser-known member of the mint family native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This low-growing perennial herb is characterized by its rounded leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. Despite its modest appearance, it plays a vital role in its ecosystem by supporting local pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky habitats. Its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. As climate change alters its natural range, understanding and protecting this species becomes increasingly important.</p>
