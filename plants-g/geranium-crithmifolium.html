                    <h1>Geranium crithmifolium</h1>
<p>Geranium crithmifolium, commonly known as sea geranium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Geranium crithmifolium is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
