<p>Gossypium hirsutum subsp.</p>
<p>latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cotton, is a botanical variant of upland cotton. It is characterized by its wider leaves compared to the standard subspecies, which can affect its photosynthetic efficiency.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in warm climates. It produces fluffy fibers used in textile manufacturing, similar to other cotton species.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated due to its lower yield and specific environmental requirements.</p>
