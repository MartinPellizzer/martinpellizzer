<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium mixtum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
