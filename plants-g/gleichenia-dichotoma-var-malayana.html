                    <h1>Gleichenia dichotoma var. malayana</h1>
<p>Gleichenia dichotoma var. malayana, commonly known as the Malay spleenwort, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that are often divided into two distinct sections, giving it a dichotomous branching pattern. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>The varietal form malayana is distinguished by specific morphological traits that set it apart from other varieties of Gleichenia dichotoma.</p>
