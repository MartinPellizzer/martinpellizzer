                    <h1>Gossypium birkinshawii</h1>
<p>Gossypium birkinshawii, commonly known as the Kew cotton, is a rare and endangered species of cotton native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that are not typically used for commercial textile production. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic makeup and its role in the study of cotton evolution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
