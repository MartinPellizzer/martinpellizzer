                    <h1>Grammocarpus calliceras</h1>
<p>Grammocarpus calliceras, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its ability to derive some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
