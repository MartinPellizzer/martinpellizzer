<p>Gyrocarpus americanus subsp.</p>
<p>pachyphyllus, commonly known as the thick-leafed chenopod, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are thick and waxy, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it produces small, round fruits that are often covered in a thick, fleshy coating.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
