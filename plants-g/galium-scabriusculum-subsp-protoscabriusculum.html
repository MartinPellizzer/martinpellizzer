<p>Galium scabriusculum subsp.</p>
<p>protoscabriusculum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically features slender, ascending stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, which give it its "scabriusculum" name meaning "rough little.".</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
