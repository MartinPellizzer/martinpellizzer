                    <h1>Geodorum</h1>
<p>Geodorum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Geodorum species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil.</p>
<p>They are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
