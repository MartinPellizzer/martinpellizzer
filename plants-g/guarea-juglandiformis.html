<p>Guarea juglandiformis, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, compound leaves that are often used for medicinal purposes.

Its seeds are dispersed by animals, particularly agoutis, which play a crucial role in the tree's reproduction.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ecological importance and is a key species in maintaining the biodiversity of the Amazon ecosystem.</p>
