<p>Galanthus byzantinus subsp.</p>
<p>tughrulii, commonly known as the Tughrulii snowdrop, is a rare and ornamental member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate white flowers with green markings, which bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
