                    <h1>Gossypium peruvianum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Gossypium peruvianum var. glabrum, commonly known as the Peruvian cotton, is a species of wild cotton native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, woolly leaves, which are typical features of the Gossypium genus. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are harvested for textile use, though it is less commercially significant than other cotton varieties. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to botanists and plant breeders for potential agricultural improvements.</p>
