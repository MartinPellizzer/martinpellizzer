                    <h1>Galanthus rachelae</h1>
<p>Galanthus rachelae, commonly known as Rachel's snowdrop, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central Spain, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate white flowers with a greenish hue, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous underground stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus rachelae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
