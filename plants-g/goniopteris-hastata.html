                    <h1>Goniopteris hastata</h1>
<p>Goniopteris hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
