                    <h1>Gagea soleirolii var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Gagea soleirolii var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is adapted to survive in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
