                    <h1>Gossypium laxum</h1>
<p>Gossypium laxum, commonly known as the loose cotton plant, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, cotton-like capsules. Its fibers, though not as commercially valuable as those of Gossypium hirsutum, have been used in traditional textiles and for other local purposes.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to adapt to harsh conditions makes it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
