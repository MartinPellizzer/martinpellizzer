                    <h1>Goniolimon orthocladum</h1>
<p>Goniolimon orthocladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goniolimon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It is adapted to grow in saline or alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
