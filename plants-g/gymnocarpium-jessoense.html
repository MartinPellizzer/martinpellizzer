<p>Gymnocarpium jessoense, commonly known as the Japanese naked-seed plant, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually serrated and have a dark green color. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in a raceme, and it produces a unique type of fruit called a follicle.</p>
<p>Gymnocarpium jessoense is notable for its lack of a true fruit covering, which is why it is referred to as "naked-seed.".</p>
