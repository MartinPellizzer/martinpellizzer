                    <h1>Grona cordifolia</h1>
<p>Grona cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>Grona cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
