<p>Gladiolus robertsoniae, commonly known as the Robertson's gladiolus, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tall spikes of vibrant, often purple or red flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils. It is classified as a monocot, belonging to the Iridaceae family, and is closely related to other gladiolus species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
