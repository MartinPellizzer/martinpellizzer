                    <h1>Gireoudia hydrocotylifolia</h1>
<p>Gireoudia hydrocotylifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Gireoudia hydrocotylifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
