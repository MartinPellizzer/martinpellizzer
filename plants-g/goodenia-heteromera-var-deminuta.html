<p>Goodenia heteromera var. deminuta, commonly known as the slender goodenia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. The plant typically grows from a compact, woody base and is well adapted to drought conditions. It is often found in sandy soils and is a component of the local flora in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Goodenia heteromera.</p>
