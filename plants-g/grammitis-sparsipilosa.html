                    <h1>Grammitis sparsipilosa</h1>
<p>Grammitis sparsipilosa, commonly known as the sparsely haired fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered with sparse, short hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for moisture and nutrients rather than soil. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Grammitis sparsipilosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
