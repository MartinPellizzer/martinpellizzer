<p>Gilia pinnatifida var. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone soils, which influence its distribution and morphology. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in harsh, dry climates.</p>
