<p>Gymnadenia miniata f. minor, commonly known as the lesser grass of the mountain, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single flower spike with several small blossoms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
