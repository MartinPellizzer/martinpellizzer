<p>Gonocarpus micranthus subsp.</p>
<p>ramosissimus, commonly known as the hairy sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It has dense, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fibrous roots enable it to survive in sandy soils with limited moisture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
