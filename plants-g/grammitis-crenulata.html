<p>Grammitis crenulata, commonly known as the notched fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear moss-like. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Grammitis crenulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings.</p>
