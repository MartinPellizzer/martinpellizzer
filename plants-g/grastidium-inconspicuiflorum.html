                    <h1>Grastidium inconspicuiflorum</h1>
<p>Grastidium inconspicuiflorum, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among its dense foliage, making it difficult to spot. The plant has a compact growth habit with dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the brief summer months, when it produces delicate, pale pink blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Grastidium inconspicuiflorum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
