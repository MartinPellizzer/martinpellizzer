                    <h1>Grantia</h1>
<p>Grantia, commonly known as the sea whip, is a type of marine sponge that belongs to the phylum Porifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, calcareous skeleton that provides structural support. The organism lacks true tissues and organs, relying on specialized cells for various functions. Grantia is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to substrates such as rocks.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and unique skeletal composition make it an important component of marine ecosystems.</p>
