The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
