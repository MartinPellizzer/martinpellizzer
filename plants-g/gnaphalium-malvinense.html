                    <h1>Gnaphalium malvinense</h1>
<p>Gnaphalium malvinense, commonly known as the Antarctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the subantarctic region, particularly the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small, low-growing herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky or barren ground. The plant produces tiny, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, which bloom during the short summer season. It has a fibrous root system and hairy stems and leaves, adaptations to the harsh, cold climate.</p>
<p>Gnaphalium malvinense plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for invertebrates and serving as a pioneer species in disturbed or glacial environments.</p>
