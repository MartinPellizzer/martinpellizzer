                    <h1>Grastidium ornithoflorum</h1>
<p>Grastidium ornithoflorum, commonly known as the featherleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves and striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or among moss-covered stones. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blossoms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Grastidium ornithoflorum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
