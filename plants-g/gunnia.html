                    <h1>Gunnia</h1>
<p>Gunnia, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "snow flower," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where they thrive in high-altitude, arid environments. Gunnia species are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that help them store water. They often have a delicate, frost-resistant appearance, which is well-suited to their cold, mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to their unique adaptations, Gunnia plants are sometimes cultivated as ornamental species in cool climates.</p>
