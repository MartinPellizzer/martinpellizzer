<p>Guraniopsis, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen. Its small, seed-like fruits are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across sandy and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Guraniopsis plays a vital role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and providing habitat for various desert animals.</p>
