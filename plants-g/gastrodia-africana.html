                    <h1>Gastrodia africana</h1>
<p>Gastrodia africana, commonly known as the African thunderstorm orchid, is a unique plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces a single, fleshy, club-shaped corm that stores energy and supports its growth. Its flowers are usually green or yellowish and lack petals, with a distinctive, fleshy structure.</p>
<p>Gastrodia africana is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its cultivation is challenging due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
