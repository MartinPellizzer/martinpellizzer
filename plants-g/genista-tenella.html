                    <h1>Genista tenella</h1>
<p>Genista tenella, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
