                    <h1>Gaultheria sulcinervia</h1>
<p>Gaultheria sulcinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the temperate rainforests of southern Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late summer, followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a sharp, peppery taste. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctively veined structure, which contributes to its common name.</p>
<p>Gaultheria sulcinervia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments.</p>
