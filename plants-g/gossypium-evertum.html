<p>Gossypium evertum, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that eventually develop into fluffy, cotton-like bolls containing seeds. Gossypium evertum is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other cotton species and related plants.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
