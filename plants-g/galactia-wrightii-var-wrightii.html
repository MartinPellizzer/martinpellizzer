<p>Galactia wrightii var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Galactia wrightii var. wrightii plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
