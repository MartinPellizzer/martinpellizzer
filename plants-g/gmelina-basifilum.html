                    <h1>Gmelina basifilum</h1>
<p>Gmelina basifilum, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and its striking, feathery leaves that turn bright yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
