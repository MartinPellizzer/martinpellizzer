<p>Glechoma petraea, commonly known as rock speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and limestone habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky surfaces. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Glechoma petraea is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments.</p>
