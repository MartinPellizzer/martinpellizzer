                    <h1>Gomphia oleifolia</h1>
<p>Gomphia oleifolia, commonly known as the oil fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, floating fronds that form a mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Gomphia oleifolia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates good water quality and is sometimes used as an indicator species in ecological assessments.</p>
