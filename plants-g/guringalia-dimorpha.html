<p>Guringalia dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form guringa, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique dimorphic leaves, which exhibit different shapes and sizes depending on their position on the plant. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Guringalia dimorpha is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
