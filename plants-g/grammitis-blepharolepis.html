<p>Grammitis blepharolepis, commonly known as the leathery fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming compact, cushion-like rosettes. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a dark green, glossy appearance that contrasts with its delicate, feathery structure.</p>
<p>Grammitis blepharolepis is often found in shaded, moist forests, where it thrives in the canopy layers of tropical rainforests.</p>
