<p>Gymnosporia eremoecusa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Gymnosporia eremoecusa is well adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient soils and can thrive with minimal water.</p>
