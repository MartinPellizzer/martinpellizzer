<p>Grona juruenensis, commonly known as the Juruenense fern, is a rare plant species native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its unique morphology includes small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grona juruenensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
