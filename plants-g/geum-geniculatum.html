                    <h1>Geum geniculatum</h1>
<p>Geum geniculatum, commonly known as the zigzag goldenroot, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its zigzagging stems, which give it its common name, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shady woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Geum geniculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators.</p>
