<p>Glochidion auii, commonly known as the Auii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Taiwan and thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. It produces yellowish flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by relying on host trees for nutrients while also contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
