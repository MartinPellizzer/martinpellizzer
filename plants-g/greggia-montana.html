                    <h1>Greggia montana</h1>
<p>Greggia montana, commonly known as the mountain greggia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Greggia montana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is primarily found in the wild.</p>
