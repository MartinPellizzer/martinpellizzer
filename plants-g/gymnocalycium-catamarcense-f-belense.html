<p>Gymnocalycium catamarcense f. belense, commonly known as the Belen cactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions to ensure its survival.</p>
