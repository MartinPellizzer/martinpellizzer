<p>Galactites tomentosus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent soil erosion.</p>
