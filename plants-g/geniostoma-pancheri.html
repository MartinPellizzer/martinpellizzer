<p>Geniostoma pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated inflorescence and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its habitat is highly specialized, making it vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
