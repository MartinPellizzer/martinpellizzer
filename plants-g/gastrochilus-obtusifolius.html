<p>Gastrochilus obtusifolius, commonly known as the blunt-leafed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.

It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
