<p>Gossypium anomalum subsp.</p>
<p>triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaved cotton, is a rare and specialized cotton species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique triphyllous leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its fibrous capsules that contain small, hairy seeds, a feature that distinguishes it from other cotton species. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and high UV exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for research in plant adaptation and conservation biology.</p>
