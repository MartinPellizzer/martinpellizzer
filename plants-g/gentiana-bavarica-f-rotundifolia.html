                    <h1>Gentiana bavarica f. rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Gentiana bavarica f. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf gentian, is a botanical variant of the gentian genus native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive round or broadly ovate leaves, which differ from the typical lanceolate leaves of the species. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
