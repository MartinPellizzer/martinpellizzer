                    <h1>Grammitis ancestralis</h1>
<p>Grammitis ancestralis, commonly known as the ancestral fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Grammitis ancestralis is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
