<p>Geophila renaris, commonly known as the water starwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, star-shaped white flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Geophila renaris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects.</p>
