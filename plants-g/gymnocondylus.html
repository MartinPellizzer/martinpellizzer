<p>Gymnocondylus, commonly known as the naked knuckle orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive, often showy labellum. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Gymnocondylus species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their specialized adaptations for pollination and their role in diverse ecosystems.</p>
