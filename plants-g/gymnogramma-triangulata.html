<p>Gymnogramma triangulata, commonly known as the three-lobed spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-lobed) fronds. The plant's leaves are typically divided into three distinct segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Gymnogramma triangulata is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
