<p>Griffitharia hemsleyi, commonly known as the Hemsley's griffitharia, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, sprawling growth habit and distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble those of its more well-known relative, the cycad. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant evolution and conservation.</p>
