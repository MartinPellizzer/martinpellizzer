<p>Glabraria geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments and requires moderate to high light conditions. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Glabraria geniculata is also known for its ability to filter water and provide shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
