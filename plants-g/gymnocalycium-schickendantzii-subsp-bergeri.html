<p>Gymnocalycium schickendantzii subsp.</p>
<p>bergeri, commonly known as the Berger's moon cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a globular to cylindrical stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white to pale blue spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its hardiness and attractive appearance.</p>
