                    <h1>Glossostylis parasitica</h1>
<p>Glossostylis parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Glossostylis parasitica plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
