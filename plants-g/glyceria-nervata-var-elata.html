<p>Glyceria nervata var. elata, commonly known as the slender beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and drooping, producing small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its elongated leaf blades and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic conditions.</p>
