<p>Gaultheria ornata, commonly known as the dwarf waxleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is often covered in a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Gaultheria ornata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes.</p>
