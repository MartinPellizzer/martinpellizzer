                    <h1>Galanthus umbricus</h1>
<p>Galanthus umbricus, commonly known as the shade-loving snowdrop, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically evergreen, providing a basal rosette structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptation to low-light conditions and its role in early spring floral displays.</p>
