<p>Grammitis smithii, commonly known as Smith's spore moss, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the bark of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are closely clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Grammitis smithii plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
