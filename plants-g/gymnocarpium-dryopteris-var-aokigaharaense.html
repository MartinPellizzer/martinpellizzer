                    <h1>Gymnocarpium dryopteris var. aokigaharaense</h1>
<p>Gymnocarpium dryopteris var. aokigaharaense, commonly known as the Aokigahara fern, is a variant of the genus Gymnocarpium, which belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant produces small, naked sporangia on the underside of its leaves, a feature that distinguishes it from other ferns with spore-bearing structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variant is native to Japan and is notable for its ecological and botanical significance in the region.</p>
