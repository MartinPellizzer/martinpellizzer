<p>Gagea villosa var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces rounded, ovoid bulbs that are covered in a fibrous sheath, which helps it survive in dry conditions. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>The hairy gagea is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its delicate appearance.</p>
