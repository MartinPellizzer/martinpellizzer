                    <h1>Gastrodia urceolata</h1>
<p>Gastrodia urceolata, commonly known as the clubbed gastrodia, is a unique parasitic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host fungi for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant produces small, fleshy, club-shaped tubers that are often harvested for medicinal purposes. Its flowers are usually white or pale green and are borne in clusters.</p>
<p>Gastrodia urceolata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its cultivation is challenging due to its complex symbiotic relationships.</p>
