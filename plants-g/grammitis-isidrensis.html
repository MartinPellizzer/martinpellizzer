<p>Grammitis isidrensis, commonly known as the Isidrense fern, is a species of small, epiphytic fern native to the humid forests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, thriving in shaded, moist environments.

Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, characteristic of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Grammitis isidrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
