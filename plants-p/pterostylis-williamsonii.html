                    <h1>Pterostylis williamsonii</h1>
<p>Pterostylis williamsonii, commonly known as the Williamson's hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that resembles a bee in flight, a feature that aids in pollination by mimicking the appearance of a pollinator. The plant typically grows in wet sclerophyll forests and has a slender, upright stem with a single, showy flower. Its flowering period occurs during late winter to early spring, and it relies on specific pollinators such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
