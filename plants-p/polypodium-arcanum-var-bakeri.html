                    <h1>Polypodium arcanum var. bakeri</h1>
<p>Polypodium arcanum var. bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's polypody, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that typically measure between 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
