                    <h1>Phagnalon rupestre var. annoticum</h1>
<p>Phagnalon rupestre var. annoticum, commonly known as the rock phagnalon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in limestone soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions.</p>
