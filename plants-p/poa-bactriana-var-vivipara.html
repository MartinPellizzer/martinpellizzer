                    <h1>Poa bactriana var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa bactriana var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear florets with both male and female reproductive structures. One of its notable features is its ability to reproduce vegetatively through vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to colonize disturbed or marginal habitats efficiently.</p>
