                    <h1>Petasites dentatus</h1>
<p>Petasites dentatus, commonly known as the toothed buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Petasites dentatus is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
