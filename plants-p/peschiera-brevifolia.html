                    <h1>Peschiera brevifolia</h1>
<p>Peschiera brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved peschiera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, ovate leaves that are densely arranged along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
