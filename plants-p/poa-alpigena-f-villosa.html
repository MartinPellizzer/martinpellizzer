                    <h1>Poa alpigena f. villosa</h1>
<p>Poa alpigena f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the alpine bluegrass species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in rocky, alpine habitats.</p>
