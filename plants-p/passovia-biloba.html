                    <h1>Passovia biloba</h1>
<p>Passovia biloba, commonly known as the twin-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate plant characterized by its unique bifoliate structure.</p>
<p>It features two opposite, lance-shaped leaves that emerge from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests. Its reproductive structures consist of small, spore-bearing cones that develop on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Passovia biloba is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
