                    <h1>Phyllactis gilliesii</h1>
<p>Phyllactis gilliesii, commonly known as the Gillies' bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its bladders for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Phyllactis gilliesii plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to the food web.</p>
