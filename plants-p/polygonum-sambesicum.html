                    <h1>Polygonum sambesicum</h1>
<p>Polygonum sambesicum, commonly known as the swamp knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, often waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common weed and an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The stems are typically reddish or purple, adding to its ornamental value in certain garden settings.</p>
