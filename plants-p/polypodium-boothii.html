<p>Polypodium boothii, commonly known as the Booth's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
