<p>Psychotria deflexa subsp.</p>
<p>campyloneura, commonly known as the curved-stem psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often curved stems and small, opposite leaves with a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its morphological distinctiveness, it is often found in understory habitats of tropical rainforests.</p>
