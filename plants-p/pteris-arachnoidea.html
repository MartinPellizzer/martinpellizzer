<p>Pteris arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble spider webs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce aerial roots that help in absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-pinnate, with narrow, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant its distinctive, intricate appearance.</p>
