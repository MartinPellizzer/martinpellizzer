                    <h1>Poa subabbreviata</h1>
<p>Poa subabbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and fine texture, it is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures.</p>
