<p>Phoradendron breedlovei, commonly known as the Breddlove's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some ecological benefits by serving as a food source for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume its berries, facilitating its spread to new host trees.</p>
