                    <h1>Polypodium polyxiphion</h1>
<p>Polypodium polyxiphion, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium polyxiphion is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions.</p>
