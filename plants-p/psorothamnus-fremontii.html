                    <h1>Psorothamnus fremontii</h1>
<p>Psorothamnus fremontii, commonly known as Fremont's greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Psorothamnus fremontii plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
