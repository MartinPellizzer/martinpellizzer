<p>Pandanus volkensii, commonly known as the African screw pine, is a tropical plant native to eastern Africa and the western Indian Ocean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense rosette around a tall, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spike at the top of the stem. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network, which helps stabilize coastal soils.</p>
<p>Pandanus volkensii is often used in traditional crafts and is also valued for its ornamental appearance.</p>
