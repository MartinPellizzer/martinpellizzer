<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in native plant gardens.</p>
