                    <h1>Phegopteris heterocarpa</h1>
<p>Phegopteris heterocarpa, commonly known as the heterocarp polypody, is a fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can be propagated through spores or division.</p>
