<p>littoralis, commonly known as the coastal phlox, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy clusters of pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of tidal marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing structure that helps it withstand coastal winds and salt spray.</p>
