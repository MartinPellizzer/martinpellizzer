                    <h1>Polygala fruticosa</h1>
<p>Polygala fruticosa, commonly known as the common milkweed or coastal milkweed, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, often spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic to some animals. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Polygala fruticosa plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species.</p>
