<p>Phegopteris kennedyi, commonly known as Kennedy's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, horizontal stems that help anchor it in the substrate. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Phegopteris kennedyi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality through filtration.</p>
