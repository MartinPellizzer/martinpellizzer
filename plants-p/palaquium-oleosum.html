                    <h1>Palaquium oleosum</h1>
<p>Palaquium oleosum, commonly known as the oil palm, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, leathery leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by fruits containing a high-octane oil-rich pulp. Its fruit is widely cultivated for its oil, which is used in food, cosmetics, and biofuel production.</p>
<p>Due to its economic importance, it has become a significant component of tropical agriculture, though its cultivation also raises environmental concerns.</p>
