                    <h1>Paronychia coquimbensis var. appressa</h1>
<p>Paronychia coquimbensis var. appressa, commonly known as the coastal paronychia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
