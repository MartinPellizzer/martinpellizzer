<p>Poa bulbosa subsp.</p>
<p>concinna, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in suitable climates.</p>
