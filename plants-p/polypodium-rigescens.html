                    <h1>Polypodium rigescens</h1>
<p>Polypodium rigescens, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its ability to survive extreme dehydration.</p>
<p>It typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces, where it thrives in humid tropical and subtropical environments. The plant's fronds are evergreen and can curl into a tight spiral when dry, allowing it to "resurrect" when water becomes available. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is also notable for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling in its native habitats.</p>
