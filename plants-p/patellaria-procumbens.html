                    <h1>Patellaria procumbens</h1>
<p>Patellaria procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate patellaria, is a small flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky outcrops or open grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to dry climates.</p>
