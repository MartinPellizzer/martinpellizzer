                    <h1>Polypodium laterepens</h1>
<p>Polypodium laterepens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky surfaces. The plant thrives in humid environments with partial shade, making it well-suited for shaded woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
