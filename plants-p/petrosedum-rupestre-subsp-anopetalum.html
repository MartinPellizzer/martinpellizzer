<p>Petrosedum rupestre subsp.</p>
<p>anopetalum, commonly known as the rock rose or stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to rocky habitats in the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
