<p>Potentilla × subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
