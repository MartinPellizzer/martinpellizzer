                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. hemitypica</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. hemitypica, commonly known as the Himalayan fir, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Himalayan spruce.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, conical crown, typical of the genus Picea. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved, providing a striking visual contrast against the mountainous backdrop. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, moist conditions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
