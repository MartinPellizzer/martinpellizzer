The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to saline and windy environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
