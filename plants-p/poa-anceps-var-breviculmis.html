                    <h1>Poa anceps var. breviculmis</h1>
<p>Poa anceps var. breviculmis, commonly known as the short-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical Poa anceps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a ground cover in landscaping.</p>
