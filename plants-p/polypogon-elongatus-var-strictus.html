                    <h1>Polypogon elongatus var. strictus</h1>
<p>Polypogon elongatus var. strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ecological benefits, it is often found in restoration projects aimed at wetland conservation.</p>
