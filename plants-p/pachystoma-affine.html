                    <h1>Pachystoma affine</h1>
<p>Pachystoma affine, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a key adaptation to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems are covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Pachystoma affine is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
