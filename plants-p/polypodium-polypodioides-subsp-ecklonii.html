<p>Polypodium polypodioides subsp.</p>
<p>ecklonii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil or rock.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
