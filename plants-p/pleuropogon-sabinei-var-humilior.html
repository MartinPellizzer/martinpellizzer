                    <h1>Pleuropogon sabinei var. humilior</h1>
<p>Pleuropogon sabinei var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf false panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
