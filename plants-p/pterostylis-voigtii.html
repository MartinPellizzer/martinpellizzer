                    <h1>Pterostylis voigtii</h1>
<p>Pterostylis voigtii, commonly known as the Voigt's hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flower that resembles a small insect, a feature common in many orchid species to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single or few flowers per stem.</p>
<p>The orchid relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
