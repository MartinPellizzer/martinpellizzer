<p>Ptychosperma rumphii, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is a slow-growing species that can live for centuries, making it a significant component of its native ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
