                    <h1>Plantago coronopus var. husseyana</h1>
<p>Plantago coronopus var. husseyana, commonly known as the sandplant or sea plantain, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are often borne on slender stalks. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
