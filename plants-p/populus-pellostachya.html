<p>Populus pellostachya, commonly known as the narrowleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and long, narrow leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated, and its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Populus pellostachya is often found in moist soils near rivers or in wetlands, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
