<p>Paspalum pruinosum, commonly known as silver paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hairy structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to green flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Paspalum pruinosum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
