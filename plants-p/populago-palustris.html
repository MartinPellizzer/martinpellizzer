                    <h1>Populago palustris</h1>
<p>Populago palustris, commonly known as the marsh poplar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found along stream banks, swamps, and other wet habitats.</p>
<p>Populago palustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
