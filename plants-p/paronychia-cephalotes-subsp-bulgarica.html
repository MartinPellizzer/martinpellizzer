<p>Paronychia cephalotes subsp.</p>
<p>bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, often appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in Mediterranean and temperate climates.</p>
