                    <h1>Polygonum japonicum var. glandulosum</h1>
<p>Polygonum japonicum var. glandulosum, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense stands. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are often reddish in color and become woody with age.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
