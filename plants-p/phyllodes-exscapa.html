                    <h1>Phyllodes exscapa</h1>
<p>Phyllodes exscapa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow phyllodes that are typically green and often bear small, yellow flowers. The plant has a woody stem with a fibrous, corky bark that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, which function as photosynthetic organs, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of its native habitat.</p>
