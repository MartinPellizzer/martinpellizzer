<p>Prunus petraea, commonly known as the rock cherry or European bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, adapting well to poor soils and harsh climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible cherries that are often used in jams and preserves. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color.</p>
<p>Prunus petraea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
