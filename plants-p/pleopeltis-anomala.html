<p>Pleopeltis anomala, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate leaves that are often divided into segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
