<p>Pozoa hydrocotyloides, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the Americas.</p>
<p>It has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
