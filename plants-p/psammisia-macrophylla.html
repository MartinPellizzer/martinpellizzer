<p>Psammisia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf sandplant, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid and sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Psammisia macrophylla plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
