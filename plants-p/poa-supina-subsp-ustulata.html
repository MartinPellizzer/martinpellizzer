<p>Poa supina subsp.</p>
<p>ustulata, commonly known as the bentgrass or cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dense, dark green foliage.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a groundcover in landscaping.</p>
