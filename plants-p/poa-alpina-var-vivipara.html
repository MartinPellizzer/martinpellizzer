                    <h1>Poa alpina var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous alpine grass, is a variant of the alpine bentgrass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, grass-like leaves. One of its notable features is the presence of vivipary, where viable seeds are formed on the mother plant and can germinate while still attached.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
