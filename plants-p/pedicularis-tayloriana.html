                    <h1>Pedicularis tayloriana</h1>
<p>Pedicularis tayloriana, commonly known as Taylor's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Pedicularis tayloriana is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
