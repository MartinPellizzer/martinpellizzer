                    <h1>Plantago maritima var. juncoides</h1>
<p>Plantago maritima var. juncoides, commonly known as sea plantain or saltmeadow cordgrass, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and brackish environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves that form dense mats, often found in salt marshes and tidal zones. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in elongated spikes, which are pollinated by wind. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal areas.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Plantago species but is distinguished by its unique growth form and habitat preference.</p>
