                    <h1>Plocandra palustris var. foliata</h1>
<p>Plocandra palustris var. foliata, commonly known as the swamp plocandra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that often grow up to 60 cm in height, supported by fibrous roots adapted for waterlogged soils. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, contributing to its ecological role in pollination.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a vital part in maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
