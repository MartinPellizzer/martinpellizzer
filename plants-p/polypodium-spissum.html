<p>Polypodium spissum, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its survival by deterring herbivores.</p>
