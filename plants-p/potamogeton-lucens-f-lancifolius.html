<p>Potamogeton lucens f. lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a aquatic plant characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has long, flexible stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are small and clustered, with male and female flowers usually occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for aquatic organisms.</p>
