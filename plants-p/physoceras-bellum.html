<p>Physoceras bellum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or root in shallow waters. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale blue, with distinctive spurred petals.</p>
<p>Physoceras bellum is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
