                <h1>Psilocaulon dinteri</h1>
<p>Psilocaulon dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub that features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from environmental changes, Psilocaulon dinteri is considered vulnerable.</p>
