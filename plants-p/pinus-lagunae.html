                    <h1>Pinus lagunae</h1>
<p>Pinus lagunae, commonly known as the Laguna pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, slow-growing evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are usually less than 5 centimeters in length, containing winged seeds adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity.</p>
