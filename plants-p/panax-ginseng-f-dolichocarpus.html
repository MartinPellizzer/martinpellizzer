                    <h1>Panax ginseng f. dolichocarpus</h1>
<p>Panax ginseng f. dolichocarpus, commonly known as the long-seeded ginseng, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the ginseng plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped seeds, which distinguish it from the more typical round seeds of the standard Panax ginseng species. This form is native to specific regions of China and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Its botanical features include a taproot system and compound leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its potential medicinal properties, though its cultivation is limited due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements.</p>
