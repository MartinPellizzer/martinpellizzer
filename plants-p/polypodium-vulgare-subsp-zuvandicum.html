<p>Polypodium vulgare subsp.</p>
<p>zuvandicum, commonly known as the Zuvandicum wall fern, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded substrates.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
