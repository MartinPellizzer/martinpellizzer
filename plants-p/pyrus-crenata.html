                    <h1>Pyrus crenata</h1>
<p>Pyrus crenata, commonly known as the crinkled pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its serrated, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, crinkled appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that ripen in late summer. Its fruit is often used in jams and jellies due to its high pectin content.</p>
<p>Pyrus crenata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
