<p>Pogonia ovata, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, slipper-shaped pouch that resembles a lady's shoe, which is a unique adaptation for trapping pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a greenish tinge, and they bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Pogonia ovata is a protected species in many states due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
