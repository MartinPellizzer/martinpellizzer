                    <h1>Potentilla ambigua var. canescens</h1>
<p>Potentilla ambigua var. canescens, commonly known as the gray potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
