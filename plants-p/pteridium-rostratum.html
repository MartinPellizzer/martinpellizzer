<p>Pteridium rostratum, commonly known as the common bracken, is a widespread fern species belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive reddish-brown coloration on the underside. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Pteridium rostratum is also known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
