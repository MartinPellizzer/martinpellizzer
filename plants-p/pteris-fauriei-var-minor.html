<p>Pteris fauriei var. minor, commonly known as the lesser water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
