<p>Psychotria hawaiiensis var. scoriacea, commonly known as the Hawaiian psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has elliptical leaves with a rough, scaly texture, which is reflected in its scientific name "scoriacea," meaning resembling scorched or sooty. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native forests.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in Hawaiian ecosystems.</p>
