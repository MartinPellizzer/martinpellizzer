<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring truncate (cut-off) margins that distinguish it from related species. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with woody stems and dense foliage.</p>
