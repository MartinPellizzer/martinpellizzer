<p>Ptilophyllum pennatum, commonly known as the featherleaf lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus that is usually pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the photosynthetic function necessary for its growth. It typically grows on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Ptilophyllum pennatum is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
