<p>Panicum nudiglume, commonly known as the naked lemma panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences.

Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Panicum nudiglume is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in disturbed areas.</p>
