                    <h1>Pericampylus heterophyllus</h1>
<p>Pericampylus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable campylus, is a unique species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from broad and lobed to narrow and linear depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and has a distinct umbellate inflorescence. Its flowers are small and white, often arranged in clusters that attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and morphological diversity, it is of interest to botanists studying plant plasticity and ecological adaptation.</p>
