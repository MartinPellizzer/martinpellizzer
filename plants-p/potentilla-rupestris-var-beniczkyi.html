<p>Potentilla rupestris var. beniczkyi, commonly known as the Beniczky's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
