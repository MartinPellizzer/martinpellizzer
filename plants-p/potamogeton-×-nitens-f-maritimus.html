                    <h1>Potamogeton × nitens f. maritimus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × nitens f. maritimus, commonly known as the saltwater pondweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to brackish and saline aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species within the genus Potamogeton, characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal marshes, estuaries, and shallow lagoons where it can tolerate varying salinity levels. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, contributing to sediment stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This plant plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of coastal wetlands.</p>
