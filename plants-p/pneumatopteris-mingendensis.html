<p>Pneumatopteris mingendensis, commonly known as the Mingendeng water fern, is a rare species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble small, feathered leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its unique morphology includes specialized structures for gas exchange, which aid in its survival in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
