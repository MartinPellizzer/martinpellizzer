<p>Polygonum macounii, commonly known as the Macoun's knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Polygonum macounii is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting local wildlife make it a notable species in native plant gardens.</p>
