                    <h1>Poa gymnohypsos</h1>
<p>Poa gymnohypsos, commonly known as the naked-stemmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in horticultural settings for erosion control.</p>
