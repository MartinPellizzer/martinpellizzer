                    <h1>Phoradendron mathiasenii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron mathiasenii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and primarily grows on the branches of native tree species such as the 'ōhiʻa lehua. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are simple and opposite, and it has a distinctive, shrub-like appearance.</p>
<p>Phoradendron mathiasenii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of Hawaiian forests, though it is considered a potential threat to native tree populations.</p>
