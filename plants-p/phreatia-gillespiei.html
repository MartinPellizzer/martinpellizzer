                    <h1>Phreatia gillespiei</h1>
<p>Phreatia gillespiei, commonly known as the Gillespie's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the cooler months, often in the shade of dense vegetation. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Phreatia gillespiei is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
