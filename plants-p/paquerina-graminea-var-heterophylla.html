                    <h1>Paquerina graminea var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Paquerina graminea var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable grassy paquerina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant, hence its specific epithet *heterophylla*. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical variability makes it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
