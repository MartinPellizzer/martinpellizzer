                    <h1>Pollinia leptantha</h1>
<p>Pollinia leptantha, commonly known as the slender-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pollination mechanism, where its pollen is aggregated into compact, sticky masses known as pollinia. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests, and relies on specific orchid bees for pollination. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with intricate structures that aid in the precise transfer of pollinia to visiting insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pollinia leptantha is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
