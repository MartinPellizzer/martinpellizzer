<p>Pinus ponderosa subsp.</p>
<p>brachyptera, commonly known as the short-needle ponderosa pine, is a subspecies of the ponderosa pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its shorter, more densely packed needles compared to the typical ponderosa pine, which are typically 2 to 4 inches long.</p>
<p>The tree produces large, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its bark is thick and furrowed, providing natural protection against wildfires. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
