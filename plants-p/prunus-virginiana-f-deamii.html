<p>Prunus virginiana f. deamii, commonly known as the Deam's cherry, is a rare and cultivated form of the wild cherry tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red to purple foliage, which provides striking visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to those of the common cherry but are less frequently consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often sought after by botanists and horticulturists.</p>
