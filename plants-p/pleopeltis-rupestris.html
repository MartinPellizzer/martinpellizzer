                    <h1>Pleopeltis rupestris</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dense, leathery fronds that are dark green and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Pleopeltis rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant.</p>
