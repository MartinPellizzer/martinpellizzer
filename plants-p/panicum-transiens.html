<p>Panicum transiens, commonly known as the transient panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
