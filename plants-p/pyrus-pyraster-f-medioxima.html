                    <h1>Pyrus pyraster f. medioxima</h1>
<p>Pyrus pyraster f. medioxima, commonly known as the common medoxima pear, is a botanical variant of the European pear.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, often misshapen fruits and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Pyrus pyraster. The leaves are typically broader and have a more pronounced serration. It is native to Europe and is often found in moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential for hybridization with other pear species.</p>
