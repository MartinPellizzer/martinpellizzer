                    <h1>Potentilla fragaria var. emarginata</h1>
<p>Potentilla fragaria var. emarginata, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in taste to strawberries, though they are typically smaller and more acidic. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and early spring blooms.</p>
