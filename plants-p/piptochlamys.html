<p>Piptochlamys, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Piptochlamys species are characterized by their unique, helmet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plants have a compact growth habit with fleshy leaves and are often found growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they can grow on trees or rocks, and they rely on specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction.</p>
