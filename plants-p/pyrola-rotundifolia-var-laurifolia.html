                    <h1>Pyrola rotundifolia var. laurifolia</h1>
<p>Pyrola rotundifolia var. laurifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It features oval, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats in moist, shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers contain aromatic compounds, contributing to its characteristic wintergreen scent.</p>
