                    <h1>Poa calliopsis var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa calliopsis var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. One of its notable features is its ability to produce viviparous seeds, which germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This trait allows it to colonize disturbed soils and thrive in open, sunny habitats.</p>
