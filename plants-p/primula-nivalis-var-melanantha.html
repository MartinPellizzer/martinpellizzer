                    <h1>Primula nivalis var. melanantha</h1>
<p>Primula nivalis var. melanantha, commonly known as the black-leaved primrose, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to almost black foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually tubular and bloom in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has emerged.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
