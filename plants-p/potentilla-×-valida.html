                    <h1>Potentilla × valida</h1>
<p>Potentilla × valida, commonly known as the evergreen potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, Potentilla × valida is widely cultivated in temperate climates.</p>
