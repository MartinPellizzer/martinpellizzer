                    <h1>Populus dentifolia</h1>
<p>Populus dentifolia, commonly known as the serrated poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which have serrated edges and are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among members of the Populus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The bark of Populus dentifolia is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
