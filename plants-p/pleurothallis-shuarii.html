                    <h1>Pleurothallis shuarii</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis shuarii, commonly known as the Shuari orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and thrives in well-draining, loose soil. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it often grows on the trunks or branches of trees rather than in the ground.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native region.</p>
