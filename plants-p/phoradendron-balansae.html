                    <h1>Phoradendron balansae</h1>
<p>Phoradendron balansae, commonly known as the Balans√°'s mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and white, fragrant flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Its berries, which are often consumed by birds, play a role in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological interactions and its role in the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
