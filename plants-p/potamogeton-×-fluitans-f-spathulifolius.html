                    <h1>Potamogeton × fluitans f. spathulifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × fluitans f. spathulifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along its stem.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often floating on the water surface. Its leaves are usually submerged, with some emergent portions, and it can form dense underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributing to water clarity through its dense growth.</p>
