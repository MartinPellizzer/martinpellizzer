                <h1>Plantaginorchis alinae</h1>
<p>Plantaginorchis alinae, commonly known as the Alina's plantain orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly through its habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
