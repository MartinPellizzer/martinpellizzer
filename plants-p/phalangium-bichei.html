                    <h1>Phalangium bichei</h1>
<p>Phalangium bichei, commonly known as the Biche's centipede, is a species of centipede belonging to the family Scolopendridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and numerous pairs of jointed legs, typical of centipedes. The plant-like appearance of its body can sometimes lead to confusion with certain arthropods or even plants. It thrives in moist, humid environments, often found in leaf litter or under rocks.</p>
<p>While not a plant, it plays a role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
