                    <h1>Paspalum praecox var. curtisianum</h1>
<p>Paspalum praecox var. curtisianum, commonly known as Curtis's false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often tinged with purple. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Curtis's false brome is often found in disturbed or wetland areas and is considered an indicator species for certain wetland types.</p>
