                    <h1>Pelazoneuron clivale</h1>
<p>Pelazoneuron clivale, commonly known as the cliff's crown, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelazoneuron clivale is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
