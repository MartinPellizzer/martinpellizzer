<p>Phytolacca sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian pokeweed, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions of Hawaii.</p>
