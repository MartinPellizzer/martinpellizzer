                <h1>Pinalia sopoetanica</h1>
<p>Pinalia sopoetanica, commonly known as the golden spire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange inflorescence that resembles a spire, blooming during the dry season. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its roots are deep and fibrous, enabling it to access moisture from underground water sources.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinalia sopoetanica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
