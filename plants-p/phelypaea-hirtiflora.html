                    <h1>Phelypaea hirtiflora</h1>
<p>Phelypaea hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which aid in water retention and protection from herbivores. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Phelypaea hirtiflora plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
