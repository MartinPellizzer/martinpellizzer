<p>Pothos sagittatus, commonly known as arrowleaf pothos, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light to dark green, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more admired for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in humid, indirect light conditions and is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
