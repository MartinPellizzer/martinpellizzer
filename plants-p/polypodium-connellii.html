<p>Polypodium connellii, commonly known as the Connell's maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly glossy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
