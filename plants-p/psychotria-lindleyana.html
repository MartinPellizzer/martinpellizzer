<p>Psychotria lindleyana, commonly known as the "Amazonian Psychotria," is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>

The plant features opposite, elliptic leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Psychotria lindleyana is also noted for its chemical composition, which includes various alkaloids, though it is not as well-known for its psychoactive properties as other species in the genus.</p>
