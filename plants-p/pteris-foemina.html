                    <h1>Pteris foemina</h1>
<p>Pteris foemina, commonly known as the lady fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions like China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arched or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in soil and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>Pteris foemina is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
