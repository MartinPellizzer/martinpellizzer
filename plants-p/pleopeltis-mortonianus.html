                    <h1>Pleopeltis mortonianus</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis mortonianus, commonly known as the Mortonian rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and appearance, it is often sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
