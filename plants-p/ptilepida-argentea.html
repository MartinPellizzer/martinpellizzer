<p>Ptilepida argentea, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Ptilepida argentea is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution.</p>
