                    <h1>Pinus armandi var. dabeshanensis</h1>
<p>Pinus armandi var. dabeshanensis, commonly known as the Dabeshan pine, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Dabeshan Mountains in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The cones of this variety are small, woody, and often hang in clusters, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, where it forms dense, evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
