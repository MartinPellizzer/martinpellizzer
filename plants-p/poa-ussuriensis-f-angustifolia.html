The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in alpine and subarctic regions, where it contributes to the vegetation structure and soil stability.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the ecological systems in its native habitat.</p>
