                    <h1>Pyrus × vavilovii</h1>
<p>Pyrus × vavilovii, commonly known as the Vavilov pear, is a hybrid species resulting from the crossbreeding of Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus ussuriensis (Siberian pear).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cold-hardy nature, making it well-suited for cultivation in temperate and colder climates. The plant typically produces large, juicy fruits with a sweet and sometimes aromatic flavor. It is often used in breeding programs to improve the cold tolerance and fruit quality of cultivated pears.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for pear improvement and its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions.</p>
