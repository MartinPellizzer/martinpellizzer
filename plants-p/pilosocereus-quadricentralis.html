<p>Pilosocereus quadricentralis, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water efficiently. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Pilosocereus quadricentralis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
