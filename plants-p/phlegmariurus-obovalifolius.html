                    <h1>Phlegmariurus obovalifolius</h1>
<p>Phlegmariurus obovalifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces sporophytes with erect, cylindrical strobili that bear spores, typical of clubmosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a relic of early plant evolution.</p>
