                    <h1>Poa glauca var. conferta</h1>
<p>Poa glauca var. conferta, commonly known as the dense bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to form dense mats, enhancing its erosion control capabilities.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
