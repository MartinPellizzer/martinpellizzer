                    <h1>Plantago nivalis</h1>
<p>Plantago nivalis, commonly known as the snow plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, and its leaves are broad and waxy, which helps reduce water loss. It is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
