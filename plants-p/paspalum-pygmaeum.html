<p>Paspalum pygmaeum, commonly known as dwarf paspalum, is a small, mat-forming grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikes. It is well adapted to wet conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Paspalum pygmaeum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
