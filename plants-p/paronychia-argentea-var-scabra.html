                    <h1>Paronychia argentea var. scabra</h1>
<p>Paronychia argentea var. scabra, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a rough, scabrous texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ability to store water in its fleshy leaves make it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
