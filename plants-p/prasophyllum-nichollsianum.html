<p>Prasophyllum nichollsianum, commonly known as the Nicholls leek orchid, is an endemic plant species found in Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as heathlands and sandplains. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
