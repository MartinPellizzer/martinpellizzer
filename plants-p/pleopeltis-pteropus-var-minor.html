                    <h1>Pleopeltis pteropus var. minor</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis pteropus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bird's nest fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features a rosette of broad, glossy, waxy leaves that form a cradling structure resembling a bird's nest. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical P. pteropus by its smaller size and more compact growth habit.</p>
