<p>Polypodium chattagrammicum, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and serve as the primary means of vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
