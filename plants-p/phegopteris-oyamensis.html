                    <h1>Phegopteris oyamensis</h1>
<p>Phegopteris oyamensis, commonly known as the Oyama water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded streamside habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
