<p>Platanthera tipuloides f. nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, boggy environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered threatened in many regions.</p>
