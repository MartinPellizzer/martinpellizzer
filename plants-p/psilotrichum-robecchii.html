                    <h1>Psilotrichum robecchii</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum robecchii, commonly known as the slender whisk fern, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern and the absence of true leaves, instead bearing small, scale-like structures called sporangia. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's unique morphology reflects its evolutionary history as one of the most primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
