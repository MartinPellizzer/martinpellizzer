<p>Perdicium populifolium, commonly known as the poplar-leaved fritillary, is a species of butterfly found in various regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Its larvae feed on the leaves of poplar and willow trees, which are its primary host plants. The adult butterfly has strikingly patterned wings that resemble the leaves of its host plants, a form of camouflage. The plant's role in the butterfly's life cycle is crucial for its survival and reproduction.</p>
<p>Botanically, the poplar and willow trees provide essential nutrients and shelter for the developing larvae.</p>
