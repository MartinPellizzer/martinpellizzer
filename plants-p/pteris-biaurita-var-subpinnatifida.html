                    <h1>Pteris biaurita var. subpinnatifida</h1>
<p>Pteris biaurita var. subpinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a subpinnatifid outline, giving it a lacy appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings.</p>
