<p>Potentilla lyngei subsp.</p>
<p>spissa, commonly known as the rough potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
