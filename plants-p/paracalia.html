<p>Paracalia, commonly known as the star-shaped orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Africa, particularly South Africa, and are characterized by their unique, star-like floral structures. Paracalia species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are popular in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal.</p>
