<p>Parahellenia globosa, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, rounded thalli.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. The plant has a complex structure with a medulla composed of loosely arranged hyphae and a cortex made up of tightly packed cells. Its color ranges from pale yellow to orange, depending on the substrate and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Parahellenia globosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
