                    <h1>Pollinia rufispica</h1>
<p>Pollinia rufispica, commonly known as the red-spored orchid, is a species of orchid characterized by its unique pollinarium structure.</p>
<p>The plant features showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive red coloration in its pollinia, which are specialized structures for pollen transport. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. The pollinia are attached to a viscid disk and are released en masse when the flower is disturbed.</p>
<p>This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in pollination networks.</p>
