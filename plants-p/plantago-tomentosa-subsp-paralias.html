<p>Plantago tomentosa subsp.</p>
<p>paralias, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in harsh coastal environments, often growing on dunes or rocky shores.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to salt spray and strong winds makes it an important pioneer species in coastal succession.</p>
