<p>Pabstiella sordida, commonly known as the sordid pabstiella, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Pezizales order.</p>
<p>It is a saprobic fungus that typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The fruiting body is small, with a leathery cap that ranges in color from gray to brown, and it often has a distinct, irregular shape. It is found in temperate regions, especially in areas with high humidity and abundant organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and subtle appearance, it is often overlooked in ecological studies.</p>
