                    <h1>Phegopteris multilineata</h1>
<p>Phegopteris multilineata, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Phegopteris multilineata is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
