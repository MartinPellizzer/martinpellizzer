<p>Portulaca arabica, commonly known as the common purslane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments due to its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctophily. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly tart flavor, often used in salads or as a garnish.</p>
<p>Portulaca arabica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and resilience.</p>
