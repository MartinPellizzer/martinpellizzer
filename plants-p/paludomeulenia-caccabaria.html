<p>Paludomeulenia caccabaria, commonly known as the marsh mallow.</p>
<p>This plant is a herbaceous species native to wetland environments, characterized by its fibrous, spongy roots that help it thrive in waterlogged soils. It produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Paludomeulenia caccabaria is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
