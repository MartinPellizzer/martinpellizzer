<p>Psittacanthus ramiflorus, commonly known as the flame fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright red or orange fronds that emerge from a central rhizome, giving it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Psittacanthus ramiflorus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in water gardens and is relatively easy to maintain under suitable conditions.</p>
