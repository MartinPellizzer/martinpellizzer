                    <h1>Pedicularis caucasica var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Pedicularis caucasica var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Caucasian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its roots. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Its glabrous (smooth) appearance in this variety distinguishes it from other variants of Pedicularis caucasica.</p>
