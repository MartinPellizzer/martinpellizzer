<p>Phebalium squamulosum subsp.</p>
<p>alpinum, commonly known as the alpine squamulous peacock-wood, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, scale-like hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring, which are followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
