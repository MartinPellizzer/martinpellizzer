                    <h1>Phoradendron cocquericotanum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron cocquericotanum, commonly known as the Cocquericotan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis to some extent. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds, facilitating its spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>Its unique growth habit and ecological role make it an important component of the forest ecosystem.</p>
