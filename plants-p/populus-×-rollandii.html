                    <h1>Populus × rollandii</h1>
<p>Populus × rollandii, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Populus deltoides and Populus nigra, resulting in a species with unique genetic characteristics. The plant is notable for its rapid growth rate, making it valuable for reforestation and phytoremediation efforts. It produces heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its catkin-like flowers are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands.</p>
