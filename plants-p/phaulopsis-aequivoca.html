                    <h1>Phaulopsis aequivoca</h1>
<p>Phaulopsis aequivoca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender stems and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
