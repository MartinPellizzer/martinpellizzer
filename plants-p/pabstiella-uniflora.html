                    <h1>Pabstiella uniflora</h1>
<p>Pabstiella uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower pabstiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants, while its single or few flowers are borne at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella uniflora is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
