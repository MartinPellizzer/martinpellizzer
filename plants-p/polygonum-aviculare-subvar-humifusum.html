                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare subvar. humifusum</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare subvar. humifusum, commonly known as creeping knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a slightly hairy surface, and the small, greenish-white flowers appear in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This plant is known for its resilience and ability to colonize areas quickly, making it both a common weed and a useful pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
