                    <h1>Phoenix atlantica var. maroccana</h1>
<p>Phoenix atlantica var. maroccana, commonly known as the Atlas mountain date palm, is a rare and striking plant native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that eventually develop into edible dates, although it is less productive than other date palm varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
