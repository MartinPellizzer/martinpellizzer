<p>Phlebodium microdictyum, commonly known as the button fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, arching fronds that resemble miniature ferns, with small, rounded pinnae that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes spread along the surface of the substrate, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care.</p>
