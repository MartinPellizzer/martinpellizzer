<p>Pessopteris anocarpos, commonly known as the heart-leaf water fern, is a fossilized plant from the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Psilotales and is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching structure. The plant exhibits a primitive vascular system with rhizomes and leaf-like structures called fronds. Its leaves are typically small, with a distinctive heart-shaped outline.</p>
