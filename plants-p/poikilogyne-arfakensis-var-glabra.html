                    <h1>Poikilogyne arfakensis var. glabra</h1>
<p>Poikilogyne arfakensis var. glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf poikilogyne, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the arid regions of Arfaknesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the brief rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a vital role in stabilizing the local soil and supporting a limited range of pollinators.</p>
