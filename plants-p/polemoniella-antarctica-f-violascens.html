                    <h1>Polemoniella antarctica f. violascens</h1>
<p>Polemoniella antarctica f. violascens, commonly known as the Antarctic viola, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is adapted to extreme cold and low-nutrient environments. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom during the brief summer season. It has a compact growth form with dark green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change in polar ecosystems.</p>
