                    <h1>Phaeocephalum inexpansum</h1>
<p>Phaeocephalum inexpansum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phaeocephalum, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
