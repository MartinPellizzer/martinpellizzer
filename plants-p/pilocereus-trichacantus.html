<p>Pilocereus trichacantus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Pilocereus trichacantus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior.</p>
