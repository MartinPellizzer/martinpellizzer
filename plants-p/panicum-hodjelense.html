<p>Panicum hodjelense, commonly known as Hodjel's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear loose, fluffy panicles of pale green to golden yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with small, pointed leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Panicum hodjelense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
