                    <h1>Platanthera chlorantha var. robusta</h1>
<p>Platanthera chlorantha var. robusta, commonly known as the robust marsh orchid, is a striking orchid species native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a consistent supply of moisture. Its leaves are typically linear and grass-like, contributing to its overall herbaceous appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
