<p>Primula melichlora, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs.</p>
<p>Primula melichlora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions.</p>
