<p>Pharnaceum scleranthoides, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to poor soils and extreme temperatures. Its small size and drought tolerance make it well-suited for sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations.</p>
