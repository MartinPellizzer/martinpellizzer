                    <h1>Parathesis costata</h1>
<p>Parathesis costata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. It is often found in estuaries and along the shores of coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
