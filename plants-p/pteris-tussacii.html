<p>Pteris tussacii, commonly known as the Tussac fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released when the fronds mature.</p>
