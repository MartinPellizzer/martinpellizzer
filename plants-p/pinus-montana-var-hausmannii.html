                    <h1>Pinus montana var. hausmannii</h1>
<p>Pinus montana var. hausmannii, commonly known as the Hausmann's mountain pine, is a rare and highly specialized conifer native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that is typically a dark green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
