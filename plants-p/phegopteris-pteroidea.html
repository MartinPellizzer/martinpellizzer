                    <h1>Phegopteris pteroidea</h1>
<p>Phegopteris pteroidea, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a member of the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or calcareous habitats, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into bipinnate structures. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in lines along the veins.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
