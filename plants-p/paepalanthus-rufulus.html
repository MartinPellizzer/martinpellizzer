<p>Paepalanthus rufulus, commonly known as the rusty pincushion cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring dense clusters of spiny, reddish-brown bracts that resemble a pincushion. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its woody, spiky structure. Paepalanthus rufulus is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
