<p>Phlegmariurus phlegmaria var. laxosporophyllus, commonly known as the laxosporophyllous thongmoss, is a variety of the thongmoss family (Ptychothallaceae).</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming liverwort characterized by its flat, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The leaves are usually green or reddish in color, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporophytes. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying liverwort morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
