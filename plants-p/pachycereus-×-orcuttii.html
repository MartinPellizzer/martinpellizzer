<p>Pachycereus × orcuttii, commonly known as the Ortego cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pachycereus pringlei and Pachycereus disciformis.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky plains. Its stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions, while its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in the evening.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh climates.</p>
