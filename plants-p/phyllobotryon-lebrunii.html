                    <h1>Phyllobotryon lebrunii</h1>
<p>Phyllobotryon lebrunii, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a member of the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped gametophyte.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a simple morphology with a protonema stage followed by the development of a leafy gametophore. Its spores are released from capsules that are borne on short stalks, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Phyllobotryon lebrunii plays a minor but ecologically significant role in forest floor ecosystems.</p>
