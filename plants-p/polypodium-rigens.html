                    <h1>Polypodium rigens</h1>
<p>Polypodium rigens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to various regions of the world, including North America and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that typically grow close to the ground, often on rocky or shaded substrates. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they play a key role in its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Polypodium rigens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
