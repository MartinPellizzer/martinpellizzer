                    <h1>Pleione vietnamensis</h1>
<p>Pleione vietnamensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow lip and intricate patterns, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in its cool, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
