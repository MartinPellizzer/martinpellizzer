                    <h1>Phegopteris denticulata</h1>
<p>Phegopteris denticulata, commonly known as the serrated cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are often divided into numerous narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rock faces or in forested areas with high humidity. Its fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The serrated margins of its leaves give it its common name and contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
