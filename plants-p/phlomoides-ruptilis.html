<p>Phlomoides ruptilis, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as deserts and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
