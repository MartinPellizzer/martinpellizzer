                    <h1>Phalangium pusillum</h1>
<p>Phalangium pusillum, commonly known as the small finger fern, is a diminutive fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance, typically growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and intricate foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
