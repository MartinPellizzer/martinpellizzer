                            <h1>Pholisma Culiacana</h1>
<p>Pholisma culiacana is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western coast of the Russian peninsula of Crimea. It is known for its striking appearance, featuring small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in coastal dunes where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pholisma culiacana is considered a vulnerable species. Its ecological significance and botanical intrigue make it a subject of interest for researchers and conservationists alike.</p>
