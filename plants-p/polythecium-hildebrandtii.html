<p>Polythecium hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's polypody, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in specialized leaflets called sporophylls.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
