                    <h1>Pandanus amissus</h1>
<p>Pandanus amissus, commonly known as the ghost pandanus, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the island of Niutao in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often pale green to white in color, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically found at the base of the leaves. Its fruits are fibrous and resemble small cones, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
