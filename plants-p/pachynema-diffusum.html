                    <h1>Pachynema diffusum</h1>
<p>Pachynema diffusum, commonly known as the wandering liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thallus composed of two distinct layers: an upper, green photosynthetic layer and a lower, darker, absorptive layer. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are typically produced on separate plants.</p>
<p>Pachynema diffusum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
