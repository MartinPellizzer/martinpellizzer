                    <h1>Poa pusilla</h1>
<p>Poa pusilla, commonly known as mousegrass, is a small annual grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and gardens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Poa pusilla is often considered a weed but can provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
