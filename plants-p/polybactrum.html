                    <h1>Polybactrum</h1>
<p>Polybactrum, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow spore-bearing structures that emerge from the fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that adds to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
