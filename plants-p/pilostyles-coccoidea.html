                    <h1>Pilostyles coccoidea</h1>
<p>Pilostyles coccoidea, commonly known as the coconut dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that relies on coconut trees for survival.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead forming a dense network of yellowish, thread-like structures called haustoria that penetrate the host plant's tissues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is primarily found in tropical regions where coconut palms thrive. Its life cycle is closely tied to the coconut tree, and it can significantly impact the health of its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a potential agricultural weed in coconut-growing areas.</p>
