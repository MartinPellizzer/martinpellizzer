<p>Phleum arenarium subsp.</p>
<p>aegaeum, commonly known as the Aegean grass, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils in arid and semi-arid habitats.</p>
