<p>Phoradendron megaphyllum, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Americas.</p>
<p>It has woody stems and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to obtain other essential nutrients. Its berries are typically eaten by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
