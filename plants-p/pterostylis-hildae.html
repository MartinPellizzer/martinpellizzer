                    <h1>Pterostylis hildae</h1>
<p>Pterostylis hildae, commonly known as the Hildae sun-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often pale green or yellowish flower spike, which typically bears a single, small, hooded flower. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys, often in areas with rich, organic soil. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
