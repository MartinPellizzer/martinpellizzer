                    <h1>Prasophyllum hartii</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum hartii, commonly known as the Hart's leek orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem. The flowers are typically greenish-white with a distinct, fragrant scent, and they bloom during the late winter to early spring. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and grows in rich, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
