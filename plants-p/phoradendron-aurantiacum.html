                    <h1>Phoradendron aurantiacum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron aurantiacum, commonly known as the scarlet mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it provides shelter and food for wildlife. Its life cycle includes a seed dispersal mechanism where birds consume the berries and excrete the seeds onto host branches.</p>
<p>This plant plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
