                    <h1>Potentilla bipinnatifida</h1>
<p>Potentilla bipinnatifida, commonly known as the double-pinnate cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
