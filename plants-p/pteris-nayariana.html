<p>Pteris nayariana, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies such as streams and marshes.
