                    <h1>Panicum carnosum</h1>
<p>Panicum carnosum, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for grazing and land restoration.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
