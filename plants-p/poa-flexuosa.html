                    <h1>Poa flexuosa</h1>
<p>Poa flexuosa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense sod-forming habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread and form extensive mats, making it a common component of natural and managed landscapes.</p>
<p>Poa flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
