                    <h1>Phegopteris angelicifolia</h1>
<p>Phegopteris angelicifolia, commonly known as the angel's feather fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often described as resembling feather plumes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its identification.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
