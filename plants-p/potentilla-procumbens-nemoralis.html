<p>Potentilla procumbens nemoralis, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>This species thrives in woodland edges and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils.</p>
