<p>Pinus craigiana, commonly known as the Craig's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer with a distinctive, gnarled trunk and a dense, spherical crown. The needles are short, dark green, and often have a bluish tinge, while the cones are small and woody.
