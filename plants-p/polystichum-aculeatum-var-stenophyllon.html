                    <h1>Polystichum aculeatum var. stenophyllon</h1>
<p>Polystichum aculeatum var. stenophyllon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hart's-tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive central vein. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded habitats, often forming compact, mat-like colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy, low-maintenance nature.</p>
