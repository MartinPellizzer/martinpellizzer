<p>Polystichum munitum subsp.</p>
<p>imbricans, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats.</p>
