                    <h1>Platanthera viridis</h1>
<p>Platanthera viridis, commonly known as the green twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, photosynthetic stems that support its growth. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Platanthera viridis is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in rich, organic soils.</p>
