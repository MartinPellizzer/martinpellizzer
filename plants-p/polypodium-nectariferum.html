<p>Polypodium nectariferum, commonly known as the nectar fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish spores on the underside of its fronds, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The nectar fern is also noted for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for epiphytic growth on trees or rocks.</p>
