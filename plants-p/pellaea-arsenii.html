                    <h1>Pellaea arsenii</h1>
<p>Pellaea arsenii, commonly known as the arsenic fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a distinctive pattern. Pellaea arsenii thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
