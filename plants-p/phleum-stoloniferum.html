                    <h1>Phleum stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Phleum stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping barleygrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
