<p>Pteridium caudatum subsp.</p>
<p>arachnoideum, commonly known as the spider fern, is a member of the dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble spider legs, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
