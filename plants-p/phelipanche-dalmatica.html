                    <h1>Phelipanche dalmatica</h1>
<p>Phelipanche dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in Mediterranean regions and is often found parasitizing crops such as tomatoes and beans. Due to its lack of roots and photosynthetic ability, it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating seeds that attach to the roots of host plants, forming specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
