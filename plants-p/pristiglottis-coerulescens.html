                    <h1>Pristiglottis coerulescens</h1>
<p>Pristiglottis coerulescens, commonly known as the blue star fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
