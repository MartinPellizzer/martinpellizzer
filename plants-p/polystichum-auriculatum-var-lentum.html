                    <h1>Polystichum auriculatum var. lentum</h1>
<p>Polystichum auriculatum var. lentum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
