                    <h1>Psammophora</h1>
<p>Psammophora, commonly known as sand lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Psammophora species are typically found on rocky surfaces or in sandy soils, where they contribute to soil stabilization. These lichens are often indicators of environmental conditions, such as drought or nutrient scarcity.</p>
<p>Their simple structure and slow growth make them resilient yet sensitive to ecological changes.</p>
