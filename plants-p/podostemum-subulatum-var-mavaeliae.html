                    <h1>Podostemum subulatum var. mavaeliae</h1>
<p>Podostemum subulatum var. mavaeliae, commonly known as the Mavaelia podostemum, is a rare aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to grow on submerged rocks in fast-flowing streams. The plant produces tiny, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is often found in clear, nutrient-rich waters. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in highly specialized microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, this species is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
