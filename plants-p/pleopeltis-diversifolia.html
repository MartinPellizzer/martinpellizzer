<p>Pleopeltis diversifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to surfaces while absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture.</p>
