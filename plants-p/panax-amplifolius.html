<p>Panax amplifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are typically harvested for their medicinal properties. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are valued for their use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax amplifolius is now considered an endangered species.</p>
