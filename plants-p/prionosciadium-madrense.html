<p>Prionosciadium madrense, commonly known as the Madre√±a watercress, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the water surface. Its roots are adapted for aquatic environments, allowing it to anchor in muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
