                    <h1>Pharnaceum patens</h1>
<p>Pharnaceum patens, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, finger-like lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the water surface, typically in the spring. It thrives in shallow, still waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Pharnaceum patens plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
