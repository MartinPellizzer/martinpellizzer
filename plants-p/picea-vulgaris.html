                    <h1>Picea vulgaris</h1>
<p>Picea vulgaris, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. White spruce thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and paper production.</p>
