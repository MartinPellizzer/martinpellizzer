<p>Psilotum triquetrum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender whisk fern, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, dichotomously branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant lacks true roots and relies on its rhizomes for nutrient absorption. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage, it provides insights into the early evolution of vascular plants.</p>
