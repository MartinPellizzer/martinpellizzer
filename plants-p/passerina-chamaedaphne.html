<p>Passerina chamaedaphne, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infects coniferous trees such as fir and spruce.</p>
<p>It produces small, white, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then spread its seeds to new hosts. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots into the host tree. It forms dense clusters on branches, often leading to the deformation or death of the host.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Passerina chamaedaphne plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife.</p>
