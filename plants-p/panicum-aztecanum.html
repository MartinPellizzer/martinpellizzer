                    <h1>Panicum aztecanum</h1>
<p>Panicum aztecanum, commonly known as Mexican grass or Aztec grass, is a perennial warm-season grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It is adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate poor soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an effective pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
