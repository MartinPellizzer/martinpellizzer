                    <h1>Polystichum tsus-simense</h1>
<p>Polystichum tsus-simense, commonly known as the Shikoku holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a thin, membranous indusium.</p>
