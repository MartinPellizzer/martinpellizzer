<p>Panax forsteri, commonly known as the Forster ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is closely related to other ginseng species. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and its small, heart-shaped leaves. Its roots are highly valued for their medicinal properties, similar to those of Panax ginseng.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now critically endangered and protected in several regions.</p>
