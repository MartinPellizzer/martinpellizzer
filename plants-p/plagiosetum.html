<p>Plagiosetum, commonly known as the "hairy sword fern," is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear silvery or hairy due to the presence of trichomes. Plagiosetum species are typically epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. They thrive in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in high humidity and high light conditions.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with unique leaf morphology and growth habits.</p>
