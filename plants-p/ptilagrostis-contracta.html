                    <h1>Ptilagrostis contracta</h1>
<p>Ptilagrostis contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Ptilagrostis contracta is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to drought conditions.</p>
