                    <h1>Phlebiophragmus macrorhizus</h1>
<p>Phlebiophragmus macrorhizus, commonly known as the giant root lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a complex thallus structure.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery lobes and a distinctive, wrinkled surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the photosynthetic capability necessary for nutrient production. It typically grows on moist, shaded bark or soil, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its root-like structures, or rhizines, anchor it to surfaces and aid in water absorption.</p>
