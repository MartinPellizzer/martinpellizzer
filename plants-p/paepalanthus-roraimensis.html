<p>Paepalanthus roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima poinsettia, is a unique plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble those of the poinsettia, though it is not closely related. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in areas with limited nutrients. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, contrasting with the showy foliage.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus roraimensis is adapted to the harsh conditions of the tepui environment, showcasing remarkable resilience and evolutionary specialization.</p>
