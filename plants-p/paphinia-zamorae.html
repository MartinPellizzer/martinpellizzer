                    <h1>Paphinia zamorae</h1>
<p>Paphinia zamorae, commonly known as the Zamora's paphiopedilum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred lip that is a key feature of its floral morphology. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short rhizome and a single, erect stem. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white with a contrasting purple or reddish lip, and it blooms during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
