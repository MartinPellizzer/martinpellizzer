                    <h1>Pyrus nivalis f. danubialis</h1>
<p>Pyrus nivalis f. danubialis, commonly known as the Danube whitebeam, is a rare horticultural form of the whitebeam tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, waxy leaves that give it a striking appearance, especially in winter. This cultivar is native to the Danube region and is often found in moist, shady woodland habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is considered a valuable but rare specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
