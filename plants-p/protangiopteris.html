                    <h1>Protangiopteris</h1>
<p>Protangiopteris, commonly known as the *Dawsonia* fern, is a genus of extinct giant ferns that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods.</p>
<p>These plants were characterized by their large, compound fronds that could reach several meters in length. They possessed a unique structure with a tall, trunk-like stem supporting a crown of fronds, which suggests they were well-adapted to the dense, swampy environments of their time. Protangiopteris species had a complex vascular system, enabling efficient water and nutrient transport, which contributed to their impressive size.</p>
<p>Fossil records indicate that they played a significant role in the early development of forest ecosystems.</p>
