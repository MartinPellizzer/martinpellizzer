<p>Potentilla thyrsiflora var. brixinensis, commonly known as the Brixen thimbleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
