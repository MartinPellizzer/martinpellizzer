                    <h1>Platanthera crassinervia</h1>
<p>Platanthera crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Platanthera crassinervia plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, supporting specific pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
