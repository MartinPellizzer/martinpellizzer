<p>Pulicaria mauritanica, commonly known as the Moroccan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Pulicaria mauritanica is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in coastal and inland desert areas.</p>
