                    <h1>Poa dura</h1>
<p>Poa dura, commonly known as hard brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Poa dura is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a common weed and a valuable forage plant.</p>
