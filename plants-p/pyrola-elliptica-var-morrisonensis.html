                    <h1>Pyrola elliptica var. morrisonensis</h1>
<p>Pyrola elliptica var. morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's pinkroot, is a rare and diminutive evergreen herbaceous plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves and its distinctive pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, often on acidic, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually clustered in pairs and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
