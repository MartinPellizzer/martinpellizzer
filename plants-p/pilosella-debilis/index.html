                            <h1>Pilosella Debilis</h1>
<p>Pilosella debilis is a delicate flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is commonly known as the weak hairgrass or the slender hawk's-beard. This species is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and fluffy, white or pale yellow petals. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its subtle appearance, it is often overlooked but plays an important role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
