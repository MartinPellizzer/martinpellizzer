                            <h1>Prenanthes Pulchra</h1>
<p>Prenanthes pulchra is a striking member of the aster family known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers. Native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America, this plant thrives in moist, sunny environments. Its delicate petals range from white to pale yellow, often with a subtle purple tint at the base. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its modest size and habitat preferences. This plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native wetlands.</p>
