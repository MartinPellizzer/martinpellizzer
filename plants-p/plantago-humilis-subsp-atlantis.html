<p>Plantago humilis subsp.</p>
<p>atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantic plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy or coastal soils, making it an important species in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its medicinal properties, with leaves traditionally used to treat skin irritations and digestive issues.</p>
