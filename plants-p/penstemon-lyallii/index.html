                            <h1>Penstemon Lyallii</h1>
<p>Penstemon lyallii, also known as Lyall's beardtongue, is a striking member of the gentian family native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. This perennial plant is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant's unique appearance and ecological importance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Despite its beauty, Penstemon lyallii is considered rare and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
