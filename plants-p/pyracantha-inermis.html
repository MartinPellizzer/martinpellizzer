<p>Pyracantha inermis, commonly known as the smooth firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and clusters of small, bright orange-red berries that persist through winter. The plant produces showy white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the ornamental fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in hedges or as a specimen plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Pyracantha inermis is also valued for its ability to attract birds and its tolerance to various soil conditions.</p>
