<p>Pinus latteri subsp.</p>
<p>tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, releasing seeds in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
