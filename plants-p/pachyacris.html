<p>Pachyacris, commonly known as the thick-horned grasshopper, is a genus of short-horned grasshoppers belonging to the family Acrididae.</p>
<p>These insects are characterized by their robust bodies and strong hind legs adapted for powerful jumps. They are primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, where they thrive in grassy and shrubland habitats. Pachyacris species typically have a cryptic coloration that helps them blend into their surroundings.</p>
<p>Their life cycle involves incomplete metamorphosis, with nymphs resembling adults but lacking wings.</p>
