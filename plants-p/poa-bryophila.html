<p>Poa bryophila, commonly known as the moss grass or small moss grass, is a species of grass that belongs to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats on moist, shaded soils, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescences contain minute flowers, and it produces achenes as its fruit.</p>
<p>Poa bryophila is adapted to cool, humid environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat for microorganisms.</p>
