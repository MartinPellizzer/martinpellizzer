<p>Pulicaria paludosa subsp.</p>
<p>inuloides, commonly known as the marsh ragwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically features silver-gray foliage with woolly hairs, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rosette growth form with basal leaves that are often decurrent, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family, sharing similar structural and reproductive characteristics.</p>
