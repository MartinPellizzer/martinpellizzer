<p>Phyllorkis blepharistes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense underwater colonies. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The leaves are characterized by their narrow, elongated shape and are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
