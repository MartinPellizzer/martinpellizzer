                    <h1>Podostachys</h1>
<p>Podostachys, commonly known as the water clubmoss, is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Podostemonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found growing on rocky substrates in fast-flowing streams and rivers, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Their leaves are often broad and ribbon-like, adapted to the aquatic environment. Podostachys species have a unique reproductive system, with seeds dispersed by water currents.</p>
<p>The genus is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and is considered a primitive group of vascular plants.</p>
