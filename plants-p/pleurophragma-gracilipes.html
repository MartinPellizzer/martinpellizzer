                    <h1>Pleurophragma gracilipes</h1>
<p>Pleurophragma gracilipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed pleurophragma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants characterized by their succulent stems and simple, often triangular leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind due to its remote and mountainous habitat. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
