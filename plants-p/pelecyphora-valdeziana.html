<p>Pelecyphora valdeziana, commonly known as the Valdez's pelecyphora, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelecyphora valdeziana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
