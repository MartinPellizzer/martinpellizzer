                    <h1>Pilocereus hapalacanthus</h1>
<p>Pilocereus hapalacanthus, commonly known as the Moon cactus, is a flowering cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, colorful stem known as a "pseudostem," which is actually a modified rootstock. The true stem is a small, spineless plant called a "grafted plant," which is grafted onto the pseudostem for aesthetic appeal. It produces small, white or pink flowers during the night, which is why it is often referred to as the Moon cactus.</p>
<p>This plant is popular in horticulture for its vibrant colors and unique appearance.</p>
