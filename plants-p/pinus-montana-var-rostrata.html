                    <h1>Pinus montana var. rostrata</h1>
<p>Pinus montana var. rostrata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bristlecone pine, is a rare and resilient evergreen conifer native to the high elevations of California and northern Nevada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slow growth rate, long lifespan, and distinctive reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of other pine species, and it produces small, woody cones that release seeds in the fall.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, thriving in poor soils and extreme climates.</p>
