                    <h1>Platanthera brevifolia f. alba</h1>
<p>Platanthera brevifolia f. alba, commonly known as the white-veined lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its delicate, white-veined leaves and its unique inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces a dense spike of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost white floral coloration, which sets it apart from the more typical green-veined varieties of the species.</p>
