<p>Phragmites tzvelevii, commonly known as the Tzvelev's reed, is a tall, perennial grass species native to parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, lakeshores, and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant forms dense stands through its rhizomatous growth, which allows it to spread rapidly and dominate its environment. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a bluish-gray hue, while its flowering spikes are tall and cylindrical.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
