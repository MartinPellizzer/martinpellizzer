<p>Prescottia galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the eastern parts of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prescottia galeottii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
