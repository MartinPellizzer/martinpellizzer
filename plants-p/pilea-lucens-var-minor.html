<p>Pilea lucens var. minor, commonly known as the Chinese money plant or simply the dollar plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, glossy, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, green berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light.</p>
<p>The variety 'minor' is noted for its smaller size compared to the standard Pilea lucens, making it ideal for tabletop displays.</p>
