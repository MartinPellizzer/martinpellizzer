                    <h1>Pseudolithos gigas</h1>
<p>Pseudolithos gigas, commonly known as the giant rock plant, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Pseudolithos gigas is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
