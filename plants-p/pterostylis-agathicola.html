                    <h1>Pterostylis agathicola</h1>
<p>Pterostylis agathicola, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, hood-like flowers that resemble a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
