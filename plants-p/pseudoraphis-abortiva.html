<p>Pseudoraphis abortiva, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive sword-shaped leaves, which are gray-green in color and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by long, cylindrical seed pods that remain on the plant throughout the year. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>Pseudoraphis abortiva is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping.</p>
