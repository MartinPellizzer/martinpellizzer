                    <h1>Pleurothallis dutrae</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis dutrae, commonly known as the Dutra's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it adapt to the humid and shaded environments of its habitat.</p>
<p>This orchid is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological niche.</p>
