                    <h1>Poa lindebergii</h1>
<p>Poa lindebergii, commonly known as Lindberg's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense, mat-like turf. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Poa lindebergii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
