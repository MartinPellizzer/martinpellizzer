                    <h1>Polygonum alatum var. tenuicaule</h1>
<p>Polygonum alatum var. tenuicaule, commonly known as the slender winged knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are lance-shaped with prominent, wing-like structures along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions.</p>
