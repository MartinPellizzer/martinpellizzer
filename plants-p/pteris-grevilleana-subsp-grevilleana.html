<p>Pteris grevilleana subsp.</p>
<p>grevilleana, commonly known as the Greville's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>
