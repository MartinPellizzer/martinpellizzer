                    <h1>Planera</h1>
<p>Planera, commonly known as the boxwood, is a genus of evergreen shrubs or small trees native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The leaves are often arranged in whorls around the stem, giving the plant a neat and formal appearance. Planera species are popular in horticulture for their ability to be shaped into topiaries and their tolerance to pruning.</p>
<p>They produce small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark blue or black berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
