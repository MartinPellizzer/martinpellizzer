<p>Polypodium subandinum var. biserialis, commonly known as the Andean holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are leathery and have a distinctive biserial arrangement of pinnae, which is a key identifying feature.</p>
