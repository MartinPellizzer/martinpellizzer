                    <h1>Psilotum triquetrum var. fallacinum</h1>
<p>Psilotum triquetrum var. fallacinum, commonly known as the fallacious spike moss, is a rare and diminutive fern ally native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses a unique morphology characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, sporangium-bearing structures called sporophylls. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with its stems often rooting at the nodes and forming dense mats on moist, shaded soil. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the tips of the stems, producing spores that contribute to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
