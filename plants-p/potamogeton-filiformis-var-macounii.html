                    <h1>Potamogeton filiformis var. macounii</h1>
<p>Potamogeton filiformis var. macounii, commonly known as the slender pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in width. This variety thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its small, green flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
