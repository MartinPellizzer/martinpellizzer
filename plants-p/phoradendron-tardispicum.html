                    <h1>Phoradendron tardispicum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tardispicum, commonly known as the late-flowering mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually evergreen, and it produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to some extent on its own.</p>
<p>Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its spread across different host species.</p>
