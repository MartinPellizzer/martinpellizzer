<p>Pycreus membranaceus, commonly known as the fragile pycreus, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
