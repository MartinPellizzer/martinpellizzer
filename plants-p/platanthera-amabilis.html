                    <h1>Platanthera amabilis</h1>
<p>Platanthera amabilis, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist woodlands and meadows in North America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender stem that bears dense, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a loose spiral. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It blooms in late summer and is often found in shaded, damp environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions.</p>
