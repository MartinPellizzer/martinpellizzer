<p>It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact, shrub-like growth form. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind or insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pyrostria montana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
