                    <h1>Phyteuma spicatum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Phyteuma spicatum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name "glabrum" suggests a smoother texture compared to other varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates.</p>
