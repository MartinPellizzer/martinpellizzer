<p>Poa × intricata, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant forms dense, mat-like growth with slender, blue-green leaves that are often used in turfgrass applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form a uniform lawn surface.</p>
