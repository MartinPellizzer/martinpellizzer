<p>Psammisia glabra, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Psammisia glabra is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
