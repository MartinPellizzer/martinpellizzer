<p>Paraboea barnettiae, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy habitats, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor in nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are usually thick and succulent.</p>
