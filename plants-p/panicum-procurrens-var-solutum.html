                    <h1>Panicum procurrens var. solutum</h1>
<p>Panicum procurrens var. solutum, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often visible in late summer. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet conditions and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
