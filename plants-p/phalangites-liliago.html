<p>Phalangites liliago, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the temperate regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple pouch-like flower, which resembles a slipper, and its delicate, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific combination of soil conditions and humidity to thrive. It is a perennial herb that produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
