<p>Pseudocyclosorus duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, creeping stem with spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like in appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on the upper portion of the stem and produce spores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
