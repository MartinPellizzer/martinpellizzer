                            <h1>Pentanema × Suaveolens</h1>
<p>Sweetleaf, scientifically known as Pentanema × suaveolens, is a unique hybrid plant native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its aromatic leaves that emit a mild, sweet scent, reminiscent of mint and lemon. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a fragrant, low-maintenance plant. Despite its beauty, Sweetleaf remains relatively obscure compared to more commonly cultivated species.</p>
