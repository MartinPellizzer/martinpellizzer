<p>Panicum caatingense, commonly known as caatinga grass, is a perennial grass native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
