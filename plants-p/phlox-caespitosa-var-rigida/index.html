                            <h1>Phlox Caespitosa Var. Rigida</h1>
<p>Phlox caespitosa var. rigida is a hardy perennial shrub known for its dense, compact growth habit and vibrant floral displays. Native to the mountainous regions of the western United States, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. Its striking flowers, often in shades of pink and purple, bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators and adding color to gardens. This variety is particularly valued for its resilience and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
