                    <h1>Plocoglottis mamberamensis</h1>
<p>Plocoglottis mamberamensis, commonly known as the Mamberambe cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is typically found in humid, tropical lowland forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
