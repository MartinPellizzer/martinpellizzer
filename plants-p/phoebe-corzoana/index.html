                            <h1>Phoebe Corzoana</h1>
<p>Corzo's phoebe, scientifically known as Phoebe corzoana, is a small, insect-eating bird found in the tropical regions of Central America. This species is named after the renowned ornithologist who first documented its unique characteristics. It is easily recognized by its distinctive plumage and melodic song, which echo through the dense rainforests. The bird plays a vital role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to forest biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, Corzo's phoebe faces increasing threats, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
