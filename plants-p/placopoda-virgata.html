<p>Placopoda virgata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing numerous seeds.
