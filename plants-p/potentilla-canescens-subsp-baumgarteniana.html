<p>Potentilla canescens subsp.</p>
<p>baumgarteniana, commonly known as the Baumann's cinquefoil, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky slopes and grasslands.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, branching stems covered in grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its leaves are pinnately divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal.</p>
