<p>Phanerophlebia macrophylla var. tukusicola, commonly known as the Tukusic lichen, is a unique variant of the broader Phanerophlebia macrophylla species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct morphological features, including its thick, leathery thallus and dense, granular structure. This lichen is typically found in humid, shaded environments, often on bark or rock surfaces in temperate forests. Its growth is slow, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
