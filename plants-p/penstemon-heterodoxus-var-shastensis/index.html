                            <h1>Penstemon Heterodoxus Var. Shastensis</h1>
<p>Penstemon heterodoxus var. shastensis is a striking member of the gentian family known for its vibrant blue to violet flowers. Native to the high elevations of the Pacific Northwest, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes, where it adds a splash of color to the landscape. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, it remains a relatively rare and lesser-known plant in the broader botanical community.</p>
