<p>Poa hypsinephes, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that reflects its common name.

Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Poa hypsinephes plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>
