                    <h1>Pegaeophyton bhutanicum</h1>
<p>Pegaeophyton bhutanicum, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It possesses finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant thrives in cold, clear mountain streams and is adapted to low-light conditions. Its rhizomes anchor it to submerged rocks, while its fronds provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
