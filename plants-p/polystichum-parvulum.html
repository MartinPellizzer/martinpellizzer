                    <h1>Polystichum parvulum</h1>
<p>Polystichum parvulum, commonly known as the small fern or dwarf shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorangia. Polystichum parvulum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded gardens.</p>
