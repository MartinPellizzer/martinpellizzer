<p>Prionophyllum maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray leaves, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that provide protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Prionophyllum maritimum is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions, making it a resilient and visually distinctive plant.</p>
