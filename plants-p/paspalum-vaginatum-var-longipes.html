<p>Paspalum vaginatum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and dense, spike-like inflorescences that resemble a bottlebrush. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
