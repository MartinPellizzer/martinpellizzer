<p>Pseudencyclia ghiesbreghtiana, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. Its cones are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it is pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
