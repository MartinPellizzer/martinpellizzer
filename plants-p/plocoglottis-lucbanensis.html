<p>Plocoglottis lucbanensis, commonly known as the Lucban fern, is a rare fern species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Plocoglottis lucbanensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
