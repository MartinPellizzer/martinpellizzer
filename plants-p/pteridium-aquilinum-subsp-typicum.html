<p>Pteridium aquilinum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum, commonly known as bracken, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Bracken is known for its ability to form dense stands, which can dominate certain ecosystems.</p>
