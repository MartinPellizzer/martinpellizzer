<p>Phegopteris crinalis, commonly known as the silky cliffbrake, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>Phegopteris crinalis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is an indicator species for certain types of forest ecosystems.</p>
