                    <h1>Pitcairnia splendens</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia splendens, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that often resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia splendens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
