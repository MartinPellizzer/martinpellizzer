                    <h1>Potentilla sibirica var. longipila</h1>
<p>Potentilla sibirica var. longipila, commonly known as the long-stemmed Siberian cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with small, rounded leaves arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces clusters of golden-yellow flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots make it adaptable to poor, well-drained soils, and it is often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate and subarctic regions.</p>
