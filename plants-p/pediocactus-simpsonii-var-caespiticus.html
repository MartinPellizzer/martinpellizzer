                    <h1>Pediocactus simpsonii var. caespiticus</h1>
<p>Pediocactus simpsonii var. caespiticus, commonly known as Simpson's clustered cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing clusters of fleshy, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its natural habitat.</p>
