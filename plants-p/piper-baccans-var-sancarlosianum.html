<p>Piper baccans var. sancarlosianum, commonly known as the San Carlos pepper plant, is a variant of the Piper baccans species native to specific regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. These fruits are often used in traditional medicine and for their mild peppery flavor.</p>
