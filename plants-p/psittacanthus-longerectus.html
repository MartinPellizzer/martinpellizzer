                    <h1>Psittacanthus longerectus</h1>
<p>Psittacanthus longerectus, commonly known as the long-stalked cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
