<p>Polypodium ampliatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive, sword-like appearance that gives it its common name.</p>
