<p>Prunus spinosa proles vulgatus, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the berries. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland areas.</p>
<p>The berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though they are generally toxic when unripe.</p>
