                    <h1>Potentilla stenoloba</h1>
<p>Potentilla stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, rounded leaves arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is also cultivated in some botanical gardens and horticultural collections.</p>
