<p>Psammotropha quadrangularis var. subulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, four-angled stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The leaves are narrow, pointed, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
