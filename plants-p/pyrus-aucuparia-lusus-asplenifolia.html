                    <h1>Pyrus aucuparia lusus asplenifolia</h1>
<p>Pyrus aucuparia lusus asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifoliated crabapple, is a rare variant of the common crabapple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which resembles the shape of the fern genus Asplenium, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully emerge.</p>
<p>This unique hybrid is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unusual leaf morphology and potential for ornamental use.</p>
