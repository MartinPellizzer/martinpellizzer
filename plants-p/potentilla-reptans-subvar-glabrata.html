                    <h1>Potentilla reptans subvar. glabrata</h1>
<p>Potentilla reptans subvar. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features wiry,匍匐 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a smooth texture, hence the subspecies name "glabrata.".</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize slopes.</p>
