                    <h1>Paepalanthus tortilis</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus tortilis, commonly known as the twisted leaf cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Bolivia, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiraling growth pattern of its leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent structure that stores water. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, twisted foliage.</p>
<p>Despite its hardy nature, it is relatively rare and requires specific care to thrive in cultivation.</p>
