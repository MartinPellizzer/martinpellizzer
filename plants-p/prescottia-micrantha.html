                    <h1>Prescottia micrantha</h1>
<p>Prescottia micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved peacock orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense clusters of bright orange and yellow flowers that resemble peacock feathers. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique beauty and limited distribution, Prescottia micrantha is a popular subject in botanical gardens and orchid collections.</p>
