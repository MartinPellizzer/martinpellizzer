<p>Panicum chionachne, commonly known as silver panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pale pink to white plumes that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects.</p>
