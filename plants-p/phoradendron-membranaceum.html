                    <h1>Phoradendron membranaceum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron membranaceum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and influencing the growth of its host trees.</p>
