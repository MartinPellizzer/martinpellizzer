<p>Polypodium prolixum, commonly known as the long-stemmed sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is native to regions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
