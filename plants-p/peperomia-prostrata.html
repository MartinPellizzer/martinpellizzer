<p>Peperomia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate peperomia, is a low-growing, trailing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in humid environments.</p>
