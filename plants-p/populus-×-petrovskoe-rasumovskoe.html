<p>Populus × petrovskoe-rasumovskoe, commonly known as the Petrovskoe-Rasumovskoe poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus trichocarpa and Populus balsamifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fast growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, making it suitable for reforestation and windbreak projects.

It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
