                    <h1>Polygonum minutissimum</h1>
<p>Polygonum minutissimum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender stems and tiny, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and rapid growth, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
