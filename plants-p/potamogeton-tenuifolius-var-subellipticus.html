<p>Potamogeton tenuifolius var. subellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikes, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters, such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its dense growth can provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish while also impacting water quality through oxygen production and nutrient cycling.</p>
