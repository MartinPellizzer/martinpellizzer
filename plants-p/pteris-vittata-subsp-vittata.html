<p>Pteris vittata subsp.</p>
<p>vittata, commonly known as the brake fern, is a species of fern native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near water sources. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This fern is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
