                    <h1>Phyllolepidum cyclocarpum</h1>
<p>Phyllolepidum cyclocarpum, commonly known as the cyclocarpous phyllolepid, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Phyllolepidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, flattened, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for true leaves. The plant exhibits a simple morphology with no true roots, stems, or flowers, and instead relies on spore dispersal for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a relic of early plant evolution.</p>
