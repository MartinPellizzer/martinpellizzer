                    <h1>Pedicularis comosa var. nevadensis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis comosa var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is often found in open meadows and talus slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
