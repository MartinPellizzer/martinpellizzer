                    <h1>Pterachaenia</h1>
<p>Pterachaenia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face, hence its common name. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. Pterachaenia typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
