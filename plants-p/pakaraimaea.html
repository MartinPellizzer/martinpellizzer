                    <h1>Pakaraimaea</h1>
<p>Pakaraimaea, commonly known as the "mountain cabbage," is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand's South Island.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, despite its leafy appearance. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Pakaraimaea is a perennial shrub that thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
