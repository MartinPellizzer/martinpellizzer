<p>Phleum pratense var. debile, commonly known as slender Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
