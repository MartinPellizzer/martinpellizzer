<p>Primula riparia, commonly known as the water primrose, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating on the surface of water. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Primula riparia thrives in wetland environments, including ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective colonizer of disturbed aquatic habitats.</p>
