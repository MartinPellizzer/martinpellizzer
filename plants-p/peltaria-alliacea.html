                    <h1>Peltaria alliacea</h1>
<p>Peltaria alliacea, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, white flowers in clusters. The plant contains sulfur compounds that give it a garlic-like odor, which is characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. It is often invasive in North America, outcompeting native plants in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
