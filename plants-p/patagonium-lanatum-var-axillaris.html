                    <h1>Patagonium lanatum var. axillaris</h1>
<p>Patagonium lanatum var. axillaris, commonly known as the woolly patagonia, is a perennial shrub native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The variety axillaris is distinguished by its hairy stems and the presence of glandular structures on the leaves, which contribute to its unique ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
