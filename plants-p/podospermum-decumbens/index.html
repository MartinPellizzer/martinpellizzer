                            <h1>Podospermum Decumbens</h1>
<p>Common groundsel, scientifically known as Podospermum decumbens, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and summer months. Its creeping growth habit and ability to spread rapidly make it both a common weed and a resilient species. Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat.</p>
