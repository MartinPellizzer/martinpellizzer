<p>Poa matthewsii var. minor, commonly known as the lesser Matthews' grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with each spikelet containing several tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and resilience.</p>
