                    <h1>Pterocarpus claessensii</h1>
<p>Pterocarpus claessensii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and pinnate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
