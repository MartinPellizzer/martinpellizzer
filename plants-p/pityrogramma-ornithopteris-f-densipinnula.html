<p>Pityrogramma ornithopteris f. densipinnula, commonly known as the dense-pinnate water fern, is a fern species characterized by its dense, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>The plant's structure is adapted for efficient water retention and light absorption in its natural habitat.</p>
