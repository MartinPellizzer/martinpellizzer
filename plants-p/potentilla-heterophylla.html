<p>Potentilla heterophylla, commonly known as the variable cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either basal or alternate, often changing shape depending on environmental conditions.
