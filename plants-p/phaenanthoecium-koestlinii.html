<p>Phaenanthoecium koestlinii, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange coloration, which is due to the presence of various flavonoids and carotenoids in its thallus. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths on moist, shaded rock surfaces, typically in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are small and contain spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Phaenanthoecium koestlinii is an important indicator species for assessing the health of microhabitats in forested areas.</p>
