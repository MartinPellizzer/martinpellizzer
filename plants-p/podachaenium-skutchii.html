<p>Podachaenium skutchii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Podachaenium skutchii is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
