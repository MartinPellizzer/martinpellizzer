<p>Phragmites australis subsp.</p>
<p>isiacus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common reed, is a perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in brackish or saline marshes, distinguishing it from other forms of Phragmites. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland species.</p>
