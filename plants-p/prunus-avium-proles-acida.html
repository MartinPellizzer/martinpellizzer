<p>Prunus avium proles acida, commonly known as the sour cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, tart cherries that are often used in cooking, baking, and preserving due to their high acidity. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The fruit matures in late summer, turning from green to a deep red or black depending on the variety.</p>
