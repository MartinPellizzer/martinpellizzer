                    <h1>Panicum agrostoides var. elongatum</h1>
<p>Panicum agrostoides var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
