                    <h1>Piper nervosum</h1>
<p>Piper nervosum, commonly known as the sensitive pepper or velvetleaf, is a tropical vine native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into small, dark blue to black berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
