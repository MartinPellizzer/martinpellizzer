                    <h1>Pinus scoparia</h1>
<p>Pinus scoparia, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, multi-stemmed growth habit and short, stiff needles that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pinus scoparia thrives in harsh, alpine environments, often growing at high elevations where few other plants can survive.</p>
<p>Its resilience to cold and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
