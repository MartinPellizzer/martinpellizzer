<p>Pithecellobium pruinosum, commonly known as the velvet acacia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular, and often sticky foliage, which gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping and soil enrichment.</p>
