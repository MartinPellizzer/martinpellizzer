<p>Pleurothallopsis niesseniae, commonly known as the Niessen's pleurothallis, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids in the canopy of old-growth forests.</p>
