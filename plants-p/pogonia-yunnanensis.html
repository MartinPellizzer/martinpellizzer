                    <h1>Pogonia yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Pogonia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to China.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and delicate, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive spur that extends from the lip, a feature common in many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
