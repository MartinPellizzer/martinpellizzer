                    <h1>Pentaraphia swartzii</h1>
<p>Pentaraphia swartzii, commonly known as the Swartz's cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female individuals, which is a characteristic feature of many cycads. The plant produces cone-like structures, with the female cones containing ovules and the male cones producing pollen. It is native to South Africa and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
