                    <h1>Pellaea falcata var. denticulata</h1>
<p>Pellaea falcata var. denticulata, commonly known as the denticulate cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically pinnate with a distinctive toothed or serrated margin. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on limestone outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
