                    <h1>Primula auricula var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Primula auricula var. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with finely toothed edges and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. This variety is characterized by its hairy, ciliate (fringed) margins on the leaves, which distinguish it from other primula species.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is often found in calcareous soils.</p>
