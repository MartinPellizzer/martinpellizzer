<p>Phyllorkis dearei, commonly known as the Deare's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for native birds. Phyllorkis dearei is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments and relies on its host tree for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant in supporting local wildlife and maintaining the balance of forest ecosystems.</p>
