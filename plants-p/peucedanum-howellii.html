                    <h1>Peucedanum howellii</h1>
<p>Peucedanum howellii, commonly known as Howell's angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, this plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. It features tall, slender stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. The small white to greenish flowers appear in umbrella-shaped clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peucedanum howellii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
