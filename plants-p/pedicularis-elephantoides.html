                    <h1>Pedicularis elephantoides</h1>
<p>Pedicularis elephantoides, commonly known as the elephant's foot lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is known for its unique, swollen base that resembles an elephantâ€™s foot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
