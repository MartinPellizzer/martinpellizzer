                    <h1>Poa nemoralis var. pluriflora</h1>
<p>Poa nemoralis var. pluriflora, commonly known as the common wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it an important component of early successional plant communities.</p>
