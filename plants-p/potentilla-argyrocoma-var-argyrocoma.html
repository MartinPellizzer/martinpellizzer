<p>Potentilla argyrocoma var. argyrocoma, commonly known as silverleaf potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft, woolly hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
