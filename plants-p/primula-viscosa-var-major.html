<p>Primula viscosa var. major, commonly known as the sticky catchfly, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations, such as the sticky leaves, make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
