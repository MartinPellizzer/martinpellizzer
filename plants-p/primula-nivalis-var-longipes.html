                    <h1>Primula nivalis var. longipes</h1>
<p>Primula nivalis var. longipes, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is a perennial species that blooms in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems.</p>
