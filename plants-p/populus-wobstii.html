<p>Populus wobstii, commonly known as the Wobst's poplar, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites. Populus wobstii is particularly adapted to high-altitude environments with cold climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered one of the most threatened poplar species in the world.</p>
