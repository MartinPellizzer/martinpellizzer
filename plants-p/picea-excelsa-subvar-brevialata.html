                    <h1>Picea excelsa subvar. brevialata</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa subvar. brevialata, commonly known as the short-winged white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter, more compact branches compared to the typical white spruce, which contributes to its unique appearance. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a distinctive visual contrast against the mountainous terrain. This subvariety is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine environments.</p>
