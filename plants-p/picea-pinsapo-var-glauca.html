                    <h1>Picea pinsapo var. glauca</h1>
<p>Picea pinsapo var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous silver fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The tree has a slow growth rate and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Its cones are typically small and cylindrical, and it produces both male and female cones on the same tree.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
