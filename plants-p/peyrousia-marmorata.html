                    <h1>Peyrousia marmorata</h1>
<p>Peyrousia marmorata, commonly known as the marble cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, flattened, ribbed stems that are often covered in a waxy, white coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Peyrousia marmorata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and distinctive appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
