<p>Poa alpina subsp.</p>
<p>brevifolia, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subarctic habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed alpine landscapes.</p>
