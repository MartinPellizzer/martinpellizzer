                    <h1>Phyteuma halleri f. brevibracteatum</h1>
<p>Phyteuma halleri f. brevibracteatum, commonly known as the short-bracted phyteuma, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, violet to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, bract-like structures at the base of the flower clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
