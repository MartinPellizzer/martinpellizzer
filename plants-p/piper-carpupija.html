                    <h1>Piper carpupija</h1>
<p>Piper carpupija, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a spicy taste due to the presence of piperine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
