<p>Potentilla multifida var. sericea, commonly known as silky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats.</p>
