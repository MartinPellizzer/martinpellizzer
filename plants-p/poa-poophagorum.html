                    <h1>Poa poophagorum</h1>
<p>Poa poophagorum, commonly known as the desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological resilience make it an important component of its native desert ecosystems.</p>
