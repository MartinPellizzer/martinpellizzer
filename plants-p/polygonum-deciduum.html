<p>Polygonum deciduum, commonly known as the fall smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often red-veined and have a slightly hairy texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in dense clusters at the tips of the stems, and it produces small, three-chambered seeds.</p>
<p>Polygonum deciduum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
