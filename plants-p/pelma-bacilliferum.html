                    <h1>Pelma bacilliferum</h1>
<p>Pelma bacilliferum, commonly known as the silver-spore fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that bear small, spore-producing structures called sorangia. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its unique feature is the presence of bacilli-like spores, which give it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pelma bacilliferum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
