                    <h1>Pinus holophylla</h1>
<p>Pinus holophylla, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, dense growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species. The plant produces cones that are often retained on the tree for many years, contributing to its unique appearance. Its root system is adapted to thrive in poor, rocky soils, making it well-suited to harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pinus holophylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
