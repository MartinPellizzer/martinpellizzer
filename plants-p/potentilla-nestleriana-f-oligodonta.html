                    <h1>Potentilla nestleriana f. oligodonta</h1>
<p>Potentilla nestleriana f. oligodonta, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage that provides a striking contrast to its bright yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, decorative mats.</p>
