                    <h1>Pinus radiata f. binata</h1>
<p>Pinus radiata f. binata, commonly known as the silver pine, is a variant of the radiata pine, characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue foliage.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a unique branching pattern, with multiple shoots emerging from the same node, creating a more open and irregular canopy. It is native to the coastal regions of New Zealand and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in reforestation efforts.</p>
<p>Its cones are typically smaller and more clustered compared to the typical form of Pinus radiata.</p>
