                    <h1>Pteris pinnata</h1>
<p>Pteris pinnata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, sword-shaped frond that is usually bipinnate, with a long, narrow stalk and a broad, flat blade. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen and can persist for several years, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
