<p>Polystichum falcatipinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long. The leaves are bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
