<p>Phlox reptans var. crassifolia, commonly known as broad-leafed trailing phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fragrant, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are broader than those of the typical Phlox reptans, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a carpet of color.</p>
