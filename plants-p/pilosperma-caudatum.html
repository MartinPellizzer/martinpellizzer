<p>Pilosperma caudatum, commonly known as the hairy-tailed grass, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted, hairy inflorescence that resembles a tail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered at the ends of its stems.</p>
<p>Pilosperma caudatum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
