                    <h1>Philippia drakensbergensis</h1>
<p>Philippia drakensbergensis, commonly known as the Drakensberg philippia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Drakensberg mountain range in South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
