<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy inflorescences that resemble a beard, giving it its common name. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Pogonema species are often used in restoration ecology due to their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
