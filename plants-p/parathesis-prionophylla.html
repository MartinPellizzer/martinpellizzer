                    <h1>Parathesis prionophylla</h1>
<p>Parathesis prionophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or moist soil surfaces.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
