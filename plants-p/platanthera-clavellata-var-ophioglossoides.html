                    <h1>Platanthera clavellata var. ophioglossoides</h1>
<p>Platanthera clavellata var. ophioglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and moist meadows in North America.</p>
<p>It produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant's most striking feature is its clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are arranged in a spike and emit a faint, sweet fragrance. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more elongated floral structure compared to the typical form of Platanthera clavellata.</p>
