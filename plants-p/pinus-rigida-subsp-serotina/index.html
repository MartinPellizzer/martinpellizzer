                            <h1>Pinus Rigida Subsp. Serotina</h1>
<p>Pinus rigida subsp. serotina, also known as the pitch pine, is a resilient conifer native to the eastern coast of the United States. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, fire-prone environments, making it a key component of fire-adapted ecosystems. Its dark, aromatic wood has historically been valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree's cones often remain closed until a fire opens them, releasing seeds into the scorched soil. This unique adaptation plays a crucial role in the regeneration of forest communities after wildfires.</p>
