<p>Pneumatopteris lithophila, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and often have a bluish tinge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Pneumatopteris lithophila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat.</p>
