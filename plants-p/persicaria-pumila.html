                    <h1>Persicaria pumila</h1>
<p>Persicaria pumila, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with slender, hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
