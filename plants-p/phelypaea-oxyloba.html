<p>Phelypaea oxyloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, lobed segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in soft substrates, while its leaves aid in photosynthesis at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Phelypaea oxyloba plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
