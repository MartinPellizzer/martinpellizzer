                    <h1>Physedra longipes</h1>
<p>Physedra longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap prey. Native to wetlands and marshy areas, it thrives in nutrient-poor environments. The plant lacks true roots and relies on its specialized bladders to capture and digest small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique example of adaptive evolution in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
