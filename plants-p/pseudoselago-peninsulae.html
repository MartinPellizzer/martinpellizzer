                    <h1>Pseudoselago peninsulae</h1>
<p>Pseudoselago peninsulae, commonly known as the Peninsula Selago, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudoselago peninsulae is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
