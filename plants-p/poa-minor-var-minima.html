                    <h1>Poa minor var. minima</h1>
<p>Poa minor var. minima, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it is often used in restoration projects and as a ground cover in natural landscapes.</p>
