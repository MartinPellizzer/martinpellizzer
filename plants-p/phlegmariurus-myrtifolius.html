<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are dispersed by wind, facilitating its reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
