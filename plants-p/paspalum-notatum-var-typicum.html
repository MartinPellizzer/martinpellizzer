<p>Paspalum notatum var. typicum, commonly known as buffalograss, is a native perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense sod-forming habit and drought-tolerant nature, making it well-suited for dry climates. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in full sun and is often used in turfgrass applications due to its hardiness and minimal maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to spread and form a cohesive lawn or ground cover.</p>
