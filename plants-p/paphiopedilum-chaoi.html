                    <h1>Paphiopedilum chaoi</h1>
<p>Paphiopedilum chaoi, commonly known as the Chao's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap, a feature typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with dark veins, and it blooms during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
