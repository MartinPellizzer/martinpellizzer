                    <h1>Panax assamicus</h1>
<p>Panax assamicus, commonly known as the Assam ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the northeastern regions of India, particularly in the states of Assam and Manipur. The plant is characterized by its woody perennial nature, with a distinctive root system that resembles that of true ginseng. Its leaves are compound, typically consisting of three to five leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panax assamicus is considered an endangered species, making it of interest for both botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
