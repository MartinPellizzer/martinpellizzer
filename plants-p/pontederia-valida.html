<p>Pontederia valida, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 10â€“20 cm in length and covered in a waxy layer to repel water. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three petals and three sepals, arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomes form a dense network beneath the water surface, allowing it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Pontederia valida is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients.</p>
