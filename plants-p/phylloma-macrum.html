<p>Phylloma macrum, commonly known as the roughleaf phylloma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Phyllomataceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or white in color, and are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phylloma macrum is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>
