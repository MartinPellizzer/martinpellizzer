                    <h1>Pothos paiei</h1>
<p>Pothos paiei, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a yellowish or variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more renowned for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pothos paiei is popular as a houseplant due to its hardiness and ability to purify indoor air.</p>
