<p>Persicaria jucunda, commonly known as swamp knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features erect, slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, branching inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Persicaria jucunda thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in riparian zones and along the edges of ponds.</p>
