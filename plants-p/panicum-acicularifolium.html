                    <h1>Panicum acicularifolium</h1>
<p>Panicum acicularifolium, commonly known as needleleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically 2â€“6 inches long and have a rough, grass-like texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
