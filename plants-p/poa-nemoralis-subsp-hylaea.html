<p>Poa nemoralis subsp.</p>
<p>hylaea, commonly known as the woodland bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing turf.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form cohesive stands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
