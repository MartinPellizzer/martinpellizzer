                    <h1>Peruvocereus albicephalus var. armatus</h1>
<p>Peruvocereus albicephalus var. armatus, commonly known as the armadillo cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems covered in spiny, tuberculate structures that resemble armor, giving it its common name. The plant produces white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'armatus' distinguishes it from other varieties by its more pronounced and dense spination.</p>
