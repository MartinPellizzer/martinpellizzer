<p>Poa astonii, commonly known as the Aston's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Poa astonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
