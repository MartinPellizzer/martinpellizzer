<p>Pitcairnia altoatratoensis, commonly known as the Alto Atarato pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, colorful bracts that attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia altoatratoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
