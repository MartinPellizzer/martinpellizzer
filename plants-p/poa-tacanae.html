<p>Poa tacanae, commonly known as the Tacana grass, is a perennial species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Bolivia and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or gravelly soils, and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, awnless lemmas.</p>
<p>Poa tacanae is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and its potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
