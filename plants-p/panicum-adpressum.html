                    <h1>Panicum adpressum</h1>
<p>Panicum adpressum, commonly known as flat panicgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth that helps prevent soil erosion and suppresses weed growth. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is typically bluish-green, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often compressed against the ground.</p>
<p>Panicum adpressum thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
