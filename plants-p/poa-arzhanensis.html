                    <h1>Poa arzhanensis</h1>
<p>Poa arzhanensis, commonly known as the Arzhan meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, fibrous structure typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Poa arzhanensis is considered a rare and specialized plant.</p>
