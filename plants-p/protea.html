                    <h1>Protea</h1>
<p>Protea, commonly known as the sugarbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae, native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaf structures called bracts. Protea species typically have a wide range of leaf shapes, from needle-like to broad and leathery, adapted to various environmental conditions. They are often found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique type of shrubland ecosystem.</p>
<p>Many protea species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are popular in horticulture due to their long-lasting blooms.</p>
