<p>Polypodium sparsiflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
