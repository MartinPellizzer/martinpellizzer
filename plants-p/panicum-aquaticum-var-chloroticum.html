                    <h1>Panicum aquaticum var. chloroticum</h1>
<p>Panicum aquaticum var. chloroticum, commonly known as the chlorotic panicgrass, is a variant of the aquatic panicgrass species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced chlorophyll content, leading to a distinct yellowish or pale green appearance compared to typical green grasses. This plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow water or moist soil. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and genetic studies.</p>
