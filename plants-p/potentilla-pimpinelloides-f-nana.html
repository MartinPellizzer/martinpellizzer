                    <h1>Potentilla pimpinelloides f. nana</h1>
<p>Potentilla pimpinelloides f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
