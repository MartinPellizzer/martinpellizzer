                    <h1>Poa × gandogeri</h1>
<p>Poa × gandogeri, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, soft leaves that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is found in temperate regions. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between two closely related grass species.</p>
