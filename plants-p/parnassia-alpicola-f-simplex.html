                    <h1>Parnassia alpicola f. simplex</h1>
<p>Parnassia alpicola f. simplex, commonly known as the alpine parnassia, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Saxifragaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble those of the genus Parnassia, which are typically arranged in a single umbel. The plant is native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and is adapted to cold, rocky environments. Its leaves are typically basal, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
