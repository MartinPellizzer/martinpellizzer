<p>Pinus muricata subsp.</p>
<p>stantonii, commonly known as the Stewart's pine, is a subspecies of the Monterey pine, native to coastal areas of California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are relatively small and have a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild temperatures and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
