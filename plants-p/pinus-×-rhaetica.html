<p>Pinus × rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian pine, is a hybrid conifer resulting from the cross between Pinus cembra and Pinus mugo.</p>
<p>It is native to the Alps and is characterized by its dense, slow-growing foliage and distinctive, often twisted trunk. The plant typically forms a compact, shrub-like form with needle-like leaves that are short and often clustered at the base of the shoots. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine regions.</p>
<p>The Rhaetian pine is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountainous ecosystems.</p>
