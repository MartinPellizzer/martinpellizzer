                    <h1>Polylepis australis var. tucumanica</h1>
<p>Polylepis australis var. tucumanica, commonly known as the Tucum√°n polylepis, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, characterized by its distinctive papery bark and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level, and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered endangered and is of significant ecological importance in its native range.</p>
