                    <h1>Phragmites vulgaris var. mossambicensis</h1>
<p>Phragmites vulgaris var. mossambicensis, commonly known as the African common reed, is a perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often forming dense stands. The plant produces fluffy, feathery inflorescences that are wind-dispersed, aiding in its spread across various aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to colonize and stabilize soil in marshes and along waterways.</p>
<p>This variant is native to Africa but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive.</p>
