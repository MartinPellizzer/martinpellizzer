                    <h1>Pentaclethra macrophylla</h1>
<p>Pentaclethra macrophylla, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
