<p>Polystichum adiantiforme, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, silver-gray fronds that give it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polystichum adiantiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
