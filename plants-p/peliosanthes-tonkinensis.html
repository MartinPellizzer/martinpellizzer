                    <h1>Peliosanthes tonkinensis</h1>
<p>Peliosanthes tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a significant subject in the study of prehistoric plant life and conservation biology.</p>
