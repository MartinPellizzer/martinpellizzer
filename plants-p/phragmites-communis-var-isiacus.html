<p>Phragmites communis var. isiacus, commonly known as the narrowleaf common reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This variety thrives in brackish or saline water, making it a common inhabitant of coastal marshes and estuaries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity.</p>
