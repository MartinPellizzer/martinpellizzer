                    <h1>Paronychia vulgaris</h1>
<p>Paronychia vulgaris, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in spring. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Paronychia vulgaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
