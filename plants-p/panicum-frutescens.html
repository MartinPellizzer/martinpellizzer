<p>Panicum frutescens, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects.</p>
