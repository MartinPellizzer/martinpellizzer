<p>Pachylarnax, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>The leaves are supported by long, spongy petioles that help buoyancy, while the roots anchor the plant in the muddy substrate.</p>
