                            <h1>Panax Repandus</h1>
<p>Panax ginseng, scientifically known as Panax repandus, is a rare and ancient plant native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Russia. Often referred to as the "king of herbs," it has been revered for centuries for its purported health benefits and medicinal properties. The plant's roots, rich in bioactive compounds, are believed to enhance physical and mental performance, boost immunity, and promote longevity. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax repandus is now critically endangered, prompting urgent conservation efforts. Its cultural significance and ecological value make it a vital subject of study and protection.</p>
