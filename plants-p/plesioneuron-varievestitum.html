<p>Plesioneuron varievestitum, commonly known as the variegated plesioneuron, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that exhibit a striking variegation of green and cream colors. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in the understory of tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
