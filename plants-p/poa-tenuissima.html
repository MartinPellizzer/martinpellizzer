<p>Poa tenuissima, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are tightly packed, and its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. It is adapted to thrive in temperate climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Poa tenuissima plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
