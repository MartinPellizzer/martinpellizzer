<p>Poa sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Poa sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
