                    <h1>Pachycornia</h1>
<p>Pachycornia, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and dense, dark green foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly resilient to extreme temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Pachycornia plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
