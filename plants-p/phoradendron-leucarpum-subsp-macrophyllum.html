<p>Phoradendron leucarpum subsp.</p>
<p>macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, white or pale green leaves that are clustered along the stems, and it produces small, white flowers that are often inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to some extent. Its berries are red and fleshy, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its propagation.</p>
<p>This species is an important component of the ecological interactions within forest ecosystems.</p>
