<p>Pseudacoridium cootesii, commonly known as the Cootes' acoridium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Acoraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix-like structure. The plant is native to specific regions of Mexico and is adapted to moist, shaded environments in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is important for understanding the biodiversity and conservation needs of understudied plant groups.</p>
