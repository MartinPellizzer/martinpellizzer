                    <h1>Pinus balsamea</h1>
<p>Pinus balsamea, commonly known as the balsam fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming thicker and more furrowed with age.</p>
<p>The balsam fir is often found in boreal forests and is adapted to cold climates and acidic soils.</p>
