                    <h1>Pinus krempfii</h1>
<p>Pinus krempfii, commonly known as the Krempf's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized conifer that typically grows at high altitudes, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions. The tree has long, slender needles that are arranged in bundles of five, and it produces cones that are often covered in a thick, sticky resin. Its cones are typically pendulous and open at the tip, allowing for the dispersal of its winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
