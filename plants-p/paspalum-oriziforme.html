<p>Paspalum oriziforme, commonly known as ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Paspalum oriziforme is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
