                    <h1>Potamogeton × hagstromii</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × hagstromii, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton crispus.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with whorled leaves that are narrow and pointed. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer, and it produces floating or submerged fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Potamogeton × hagstromii can show variability in morphology, making it a subject of interest in aquatic botany.</p>
