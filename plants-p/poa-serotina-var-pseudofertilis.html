<p>Poa serotina var. pseudofertilis, commonly known as the late-flowering bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass genus native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that bloom late in the growing season. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-green, with a bluish tinge that becomes more pronounced in certain light conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and as a low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
