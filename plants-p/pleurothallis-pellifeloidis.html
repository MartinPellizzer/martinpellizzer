                    <h1>Pleurothallis pellifeloidis</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis pellifeloidis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces flowers in shades of white and pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
