<p>Polypodium kingii, commonly known as the Appalachian sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
