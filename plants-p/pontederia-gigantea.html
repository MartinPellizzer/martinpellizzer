                    <h1>Pontederia gigantea</h1>
<p>Pontederia gigantea, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy coating that aids in buoyancy. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats that can impact water flow and aquatic life.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
