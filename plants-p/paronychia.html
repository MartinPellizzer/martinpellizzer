                    <h1>Paronychia</h1>
<p>Paronychia, commonly known as a fungal infection of the nail fold, is caused by various fungi, most commonly *Trichophyton* species.</p>
<p>It typically affects the skin around the fingernails and can lead to redness, swelling, and sometimes pus formation. The infection often spreads from the nail bed to the surrounding skin, causing discomfort and itching. Botanically, it is a superficial mycosis that thrives in warm, moist environments.</p>
<p>Proper diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent the infection from spreading or recurring.</p>
