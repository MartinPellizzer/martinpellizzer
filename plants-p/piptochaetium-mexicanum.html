<p>Piptochaetium mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican needlegrass, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient species.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife, it is of interest in ecological restoration projects.</p>
