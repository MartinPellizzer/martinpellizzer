The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its areoles, which bear the spines and flowers.</p>
