                    <h1>Procris grueningii</h1>
<p>Procris grueningii, commonly known as the Gruening's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as a terrestrial herb with a single, unbranched stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Procris grueningii is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
