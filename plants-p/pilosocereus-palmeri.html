                    <h1>Pilosocereus palmeri</h1>
<p>Pilosocereus palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and dense covering of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations to desert conditions include a deep root system and the ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Pilosocereus palmeri is often found in rocky soils and is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem.</p>
