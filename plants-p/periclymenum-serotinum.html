<p>Periclymenum serotinum, commonly known as late sweet pepper or woodbine, is a deciduous flowering plant belonging to the Caprifoliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late summer. These flowers give way to red, berry-like fruits that are edible but somewhat tart.</p>
<p>Periclymenum serotinum is typically found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils across much of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
