                    <h1>Plantago borealis f. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Plantago borealis f. pygmaea, commonly known as the Arctic plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in clusters, which are adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to survive in extreme climates, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms.</p>
