                    <h1>Polypodium vulgare var. pinnatifidum</h1>
<p>Polypodium vulgare var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided leaflets arranged in a distinctive, lacy pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>The spores are released from clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
