                    <h1>Phalangium renarnii</h1>
<p>Phalangium renarnii, commonly known as the rare moonlight fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds.</p>
<p>Native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-draining soil. Its leaves emit a faint blue glow at night, an adaptation believed to aid in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's reproductive structures are small and clustered, producing spores that disperse via wind.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Phalangium renarnii is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat.</p>
