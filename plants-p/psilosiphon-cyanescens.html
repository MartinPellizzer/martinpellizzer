<p>Psilosiphon cyanescens, commonly known as the blue-tipped bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its flowers are typically blue or purple in color.</p>
