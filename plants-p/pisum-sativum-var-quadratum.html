<p>Pisum sativum var. quadratum, commonly known as the four-angled pea, is a variant of the common pea characterized by its square-shaped pods.</p>
<p>The plant is a climbing legume with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. Its pods are unique in their four-angled structure, which distinguishes it from other pea varieties. The seeds are edible and can be used in similar ways to standard peas, though they are less commonly cultivated.</p>
