                    <h1>Polycarpon glabrifolium</h1>
<p>Polycarpon glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, hairy fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
