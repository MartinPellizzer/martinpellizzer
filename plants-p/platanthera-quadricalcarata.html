<p>Platanthera quadricalcarata, commonly known as the four-ribbed lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive inflorescence of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose spiral. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a slender, rhizomatous root system and produces small, yellowish-brown seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
