                    <h1>Panicum kauaiense</h1>
<p>Panicum kauaiense, commonly known as Kauai grass, is a native Hawaiian plant characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet forest habitats, such as rainforests and marshy areas, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
