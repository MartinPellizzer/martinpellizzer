                            <h1>Pyrus Roopiana</h1>
<p>Common pear, scientifically known as Pyrus roopiana, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and edible fruits, which are often consumed fresh or used in cooking. The tree typically grows to a height of 10-20 feet and features broad, lance-shaped leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. Its flowers, which appear in early spring, are small and white, adding to its visual appeal. Despite its modest size, the common pear plays an important role in local ecosystems and is a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
