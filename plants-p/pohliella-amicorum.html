                <h1>Pohliella amicorum</h1>
<p>Pohliella amicorum, commonly known as the friendship lichen, is a symbiotic lichen that forms a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It is typically found growing on tree trunks and branches in moist, shaded environments. The thallus of Pohliella amicorum is usually crustose, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It has a pale green to yellowish-green color, which helps in photosynthesis through the algal component.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
