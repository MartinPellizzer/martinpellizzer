<p>Pinguicula × scullyi nothosubsp.</p>
<p>scullyi, commonly known as the Scully's butterwort, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, typically in late June to July. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
