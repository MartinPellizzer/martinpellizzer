                    <h1>Platantheroides hamata</h1>
<p>Platantheroides hamata, commonly known as the hairy marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its moist environment.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
