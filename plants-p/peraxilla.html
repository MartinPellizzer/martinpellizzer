                    <h1>Peraxilla</h1>
<p>Peraxilla, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, with several species found in Madagascar and mainland Africa. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, often with a velvety texture, and produce small, pea-like flowers. Peraxilla species are typically shrubs or small trees, and they have a deep root system that helps them thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>The genus is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in nitrogen fixation and its potential for use in agroforestry.</p>
