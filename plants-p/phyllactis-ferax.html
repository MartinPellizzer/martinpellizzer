                    <h1>Phyllactis ferax</h1>
<p>Phyllactis ferax, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that are often mistaken for the leaves of the true sumac species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by bright red, fuzzy fruits that persist into winter. Its bark is rough and furrowed, with a distinctive, horn-like appearance on older branches.</p>
<p>Phyllactis ferax is often found in dry, open woods and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
