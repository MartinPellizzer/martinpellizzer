                    <h1>Poa refracta</h1>
<p>Poa refracta, commonly known as the refractable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both bisexual and sterile florets, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Poa refracta is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecological systems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy.</p>
