<p>Psammisia debilis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds dispersed by the wind. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and has deep roots to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Psammisia debilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
