<p>Pleiotaxis gombensis, commonly known as the Gombes mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments on rocky outcrops and forest floors. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
