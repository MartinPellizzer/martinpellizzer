                    <h1>Pilostyles boyacensis</h1>
<p>Pilostyles boyacensis, commonly known as the "flower of the dead," is a unique parasitic plant native to the Andes region of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is a holoparasitic species, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host plants, typically members of the Malvaceae family. The plant is characterized by its elongated, thread-like structure and its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. Despite its complex morphology, it lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an intriguing subject in the study of parasitic flora.</p>
