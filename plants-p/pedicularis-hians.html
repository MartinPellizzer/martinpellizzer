<p>Pedicularis hians, commonly known as the sky pilot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that resemble a pilot's helmet. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
