                    <h1>Parapolystichum coriaceosquamatum</h1>
<p>Parapolystichum coriaceosquamatum, commonly known as the thick-scaled holly fern, is a unique fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like structures. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, rugged texture that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
