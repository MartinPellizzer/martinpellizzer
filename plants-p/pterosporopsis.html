                    <h1>Pterosporopsis</h1>
<p>Pterosporopsis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pterosporaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent, giving them their common name. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where they can thrive in high humidity. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, clustered sporangia that produce spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Pterosporopsis species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appearance and ability to add a unique aesthetic to shaded gardens.</p>
