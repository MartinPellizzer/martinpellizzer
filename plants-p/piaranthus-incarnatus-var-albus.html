                    <h1>Piaranthus incarnatus var. albus</h1>
<p>Piaranthus incarnatus var. albus, commonly known as the white-flowered pincushion plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy, spiny stems that resemble a pincushion, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
