<p>Phoradendron testifolium, commonly known as the showy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, green leaves that are opposite and often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
