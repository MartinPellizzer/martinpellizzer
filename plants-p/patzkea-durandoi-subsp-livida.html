<p>Patzkea durandoi subsp.</p>
<p>livida, commonly known as the blue-flowered patzkea, is a rare and striking member of the Gentianaceae family. It is characterized by its vivid blue petals and distinctive leaf morphology, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically visited by specialized pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
