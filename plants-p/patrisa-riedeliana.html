                    <h1>Patrisa riedeliana</h1>
<p>Patrisa riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's patrisia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
