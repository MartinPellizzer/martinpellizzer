                    <h1>Plantago sabrinae</h1>
<p>Plantago sabrinae, commonly known as the sand plant or desert plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well-adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
