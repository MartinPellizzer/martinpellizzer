                    <h1>Potentilla subacaulis var. cinerea</h1>
<p>Potentilla subacaulis var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features wiry, silver-gray stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by oval, reddish-brown berries. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with a similar grayish pubescence, contributing to its overall frost-resistant adaptation.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in cold climates.</p>
