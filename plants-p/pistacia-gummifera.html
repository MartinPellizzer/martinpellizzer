                    <h1>Pistacia gummifera</h1>
<p>Pistacia gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or Persian ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and small, leathery leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is notable for exuding a sticky, resinous gum from its bark, which has been used traditionally for various purposes.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
