<p>Polystichum chilense, commonly known as the Chilean holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polystichum chilense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage.</p>
