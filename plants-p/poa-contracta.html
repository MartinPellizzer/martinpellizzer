                    <h1>Poa contracta</h1>
<p>Poa contracta, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Poa contracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form a dense turf.</p>
