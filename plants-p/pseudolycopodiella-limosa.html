The plant produces microsporangia and megasporangia on separate structures, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
