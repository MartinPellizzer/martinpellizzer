<p>Platypodanthera melissifolia subsp.</p>
<p>riocontensis, commonly known as the Rio Conti orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive violet-brown lip.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically in moist, shaded forest understories. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
