                    <h1>Pilosella erratica</h1>
<p>Pilosella erratica, commonly known as the wandering bellflower, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are hairy and grayish-green, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Pilosella erratica is often found in colonies, spreading through both seeds and vegetative growth.</p>
