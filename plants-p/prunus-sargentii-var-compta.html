<p>Prunus sargentii var. compta, commonly known as the Sargent cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and a tendency to form thickets, which contribute to its ecological value in native habitats.</p>
