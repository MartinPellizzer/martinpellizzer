<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant is known for its vigorous climbing habit, often using tendrils to attach itself to supports. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pothos scandens is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to purify indoor air.</p>
