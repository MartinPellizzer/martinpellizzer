                    <h1>Pumilo preissii</h1>
<p>Pumilo preissii, commonly known as the ghost flower or ghost cactus, is a unique and striking succulent native to the arid regions of central and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a ghostly appearance due to its pale, almost translucent coloration. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, adding to its ethereal beauty. It is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pumilo preissii is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
