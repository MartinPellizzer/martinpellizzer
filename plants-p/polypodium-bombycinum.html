<p>Polypodium bombycinum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
