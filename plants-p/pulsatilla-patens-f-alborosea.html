<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it conserve moisture in arid environments. It blooms in early spring, typically between March and May, and is adapted to cold climates with a long growing season.</p>
<p>The f. alborosea form is distinguished by its lighter-colored flowers compared to the typical purple or pink varieties of Pulsatilla patens.</p>
