<p>Polypodium anfractuosum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, such as cliffs or rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium anfractuosum is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
