<p>Pittosporum cauliflorum var. flocculosum, commonly known as the woolly pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers, which are typically borne on the stems rather than at the ends of branches. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas.</p>
