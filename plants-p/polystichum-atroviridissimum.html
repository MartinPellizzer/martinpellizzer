                    <h1>Polystichum atroviridissimum</h1>
<p>Polystichum atroviridissimum, commonly known as the dark green wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense, compact growth habit. Native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it survive in its woodland habitat.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are borne on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
