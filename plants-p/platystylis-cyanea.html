                    <h1>Platystylis cyanea</h1>
<p>Platystylis cyanea, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, this plant is characterized by its vivid blue petals and intricate floral structure. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's flowers are highly specialized, with a unique labellum that plays a key role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and beauty, Platystylis cyanea is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts.</p>
