<p>Polypodium bellisquamatum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in the understory of tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
