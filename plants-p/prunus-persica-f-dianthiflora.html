                    <h1>Prunus persica f. dianthiflora</h1>
<p>Prunus persica f. dianthiflora, commonly known as the double-flowered peach, is a botanical variant of the peach tree characterized by its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>This form exhibits double petals, giving the flowers a more elaborate and showy appearance compared to the typical single-layered blooms. The plant retains the basic morphology of the common peach, including its fruiting habits and growth pattern. It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The double-flowered trait is a result of genetic mutation, leading to the formation of additional petals in the floral bud.</p>
