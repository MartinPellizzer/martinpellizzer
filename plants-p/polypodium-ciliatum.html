                    <h1>Polypodium ciliatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium ciliatum, commonly known as the crested polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
