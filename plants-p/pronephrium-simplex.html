                    <h1>Pronephrium simplex</h1>
<p>Pronephrium simplex, commonly known as the simple pronephrium, is a type of aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched root system and its ability to absorb nutrients directly from the surrounding water. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water absorption.</p>
<p>Pronephrium simplex plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering out excess nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
