<p>Pulmonaria filarszkyana, commonly known as the Hungarian lungwort, is a perennial herb native to Hungary and parts of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Pulmonaria filarszkyana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland or shaded garden settings.</p>
