                    <h1>Pleopeltis squamata</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis squamata, commonly known as the squamata fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The fronds are typically light green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
