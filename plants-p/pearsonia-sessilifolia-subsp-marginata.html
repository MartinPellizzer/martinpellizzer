<p>Pearsonia sessilifolia subsp.</p>
<p>marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pearsonia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and sedges, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>The subspecies marginata is distinguished by its narrow, serrated leaves with a pale margin, setting it apart from other pearsonia species. It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
