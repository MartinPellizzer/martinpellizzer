<p>Pabstiella ghillanyi, commonly known as the Ghillany's pabstiella, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and related plants, though it is not a true cactus. The plant is characterized by its compact, spiny structure and produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of desert flora adaptation and biodiversity in high-altitude environments.</p>
