<p>Psychotria tricostata, commonly known as the three-costed psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elliptical leaves with three distinct costae, or midribs, giving it its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are small berries that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Psychotria tricostata is often found in understory layers of rainforests and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features.</p>
