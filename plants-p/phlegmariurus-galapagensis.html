<p>Phlegmariurus galapagensis, commonly known as the Galapagos haircap moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a mat-forming, leafy plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the humid microclimates of the Galapagos Islands. The plant has a dense, cushion-like structure with small, overlapping leaves that are covered in a layer of translucent, waxy cells, aiding in water retention. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on stalks and are often clustered near the tips of the leaves.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native habitat.</p>
