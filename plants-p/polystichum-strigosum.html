                    <h1>Polystichum strigosum</h1>
<p>Polystichum strigosum, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green fronds with a fuzzy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
