<p>Paspalum vaginatum subsp.</p>
<p>nanum, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
