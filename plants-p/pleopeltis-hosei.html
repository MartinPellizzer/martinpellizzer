<p>Pleopeltis hosei, commonly known as the Hosen's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Pleopeltis hosei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
