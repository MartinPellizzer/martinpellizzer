<p>Polycnemum fontanesii var. oxysepalum, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often submerged or floating, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on short pedicels. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
