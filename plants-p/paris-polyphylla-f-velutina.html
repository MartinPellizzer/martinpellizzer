                    <h1>Paris polyphylla f. velutina</h1>
<p>Paris polyphylla f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet leaf Paris, is a rare and endangered fern native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its velvety, dark green fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
