                    <h1>Ptychosperma hentyi</h1>
<p>Ptychosperma hentyi, commonly known as the Henty's cycad, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
