                <h1>Phallaria schimperi</h1>
<p>Phallaria schimperi, commonly known as the African stinkhorn, is a unique fungal plant that belongs to the Phallaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fruiting body that resembles a phallus, which is why it is often referred to as a stinkhorn. The fungus produces a strong, unpleasant odor to attract flies and other insects for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in decaying organic matter such as leaf litter.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves both a saprophytic and a parasitic stage, making it an interesting subject in mycology.</p>
