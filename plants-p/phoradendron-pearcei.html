<p>Phoradendron pearcei, commonly known as the Florida mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant's small, white or greenish flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation through stem growth.</p>
