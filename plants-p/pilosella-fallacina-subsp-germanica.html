<p>Pilosella fallacina subsp.</p>
<p>germanica, commonly known as the German hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant its characteristic appearance.</p>
<p>The flowering stems bear yellow daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disk florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to form dense stands.</p>
