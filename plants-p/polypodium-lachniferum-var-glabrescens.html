<p>Polypodium lachniferum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its smooth, glabrous fronds.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds.
