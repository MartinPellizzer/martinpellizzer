<p>Potentilla ulrichii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, upright stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Potentilla ulrichii is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in poor, rocky soils and full sun exposure.</p>
