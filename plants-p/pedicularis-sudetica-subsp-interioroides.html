<p>Pedicularis sudetica subsp.</p>
<p>interioroides, commonly known as the Alpine lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants. It is native to the alpine regions of Central Europe, particularly the Sudetes and Carpathian mountains, where it thrives in moist, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, featuring reddish stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many European countries.</p>
