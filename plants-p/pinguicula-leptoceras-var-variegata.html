                    <h1>Pinguicula leptoceras var. variegata</h1>
<p>Pinguicula leptoceras var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, translucent, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, delicate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a spurred shape that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its striking variegation, with patches of white or pale green on its leaves.</p>
