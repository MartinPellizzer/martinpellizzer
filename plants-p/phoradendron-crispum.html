<p>Phoradendron crispum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides shelter for various insects and birds. Its berries are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds to new host trees.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
