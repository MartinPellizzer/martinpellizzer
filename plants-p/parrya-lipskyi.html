<p>Parrya lipskyi, commonly known as the Liskyi's parrya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parrya lipskyi is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
