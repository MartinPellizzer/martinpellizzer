                    <h1>Pteris rupestris</h1>
<p>Pteris rupestris, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Pteris rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
