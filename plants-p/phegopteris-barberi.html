                    <h1>Phegopteris barberi</h1>
<p>Phegopteris barberi, commonly known as the Sierra fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous fern with fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant has a distinctive, finely divided foliage that forms a dense, low-growing carpet on rocky slopes and stream banks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phegopteris barberi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
