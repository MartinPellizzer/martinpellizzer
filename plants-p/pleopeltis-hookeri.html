                    <h1>Pleopeltis hookeri</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The plant typically has thick, leathery leaves that form a rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of brownish, moss-like tissue, which aids in water absorption.</p>
<p>Pleopeltis hookeri is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments.</p>
