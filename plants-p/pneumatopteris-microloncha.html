                    <h1>Pneumatopteris microloncha</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris microloncha, commonly known as the small-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often divided into small, lobed segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green and can range in size, contributing to the plant's role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
