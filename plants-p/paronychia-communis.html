                    <h1>Paronychia communis</h1>
<p>Paronychia communis, commonly known as the common nail fungus, is a type of fungal infection that affects the skin around the nails.</p>
<p>It is caused by dermatophytes, particularly species of the genus *Trichophyton*. The infection typically begins as a small, red, itchy rash at the base or sides of the nail, which can progress to involve the nail plate itself. It is often found in warm, moist environments and is more common in individuals with frequent hand immersion in water.</p>
<p>Proper diagnosis and treatment with antifungal medications are essential to prevent the spread of the infection.</p>
