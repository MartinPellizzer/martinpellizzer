                    <h1>Pachypodium rosulatum var. gracilius</h1>
<p>Pachypodium rosulatum var. gracilius, commonly known as the slender bottle tree, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by woody pods containing seeds. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
