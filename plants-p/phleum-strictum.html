                    <h1>Phleum strictum</h1>
<p>Phleum strictum, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairless or slightly hairy, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a tough, straw-colored husk, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
