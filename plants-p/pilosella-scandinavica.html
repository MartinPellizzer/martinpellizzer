                    <h1>Pilosella scandinavica</h1>
<p>Pilosella scandinavica, commonly known as the Scandinavian pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Europe and is characterized by its small, daisy-like white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often harsh, alpine or arctic habitats. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across rocky and open ground.</p>
<p>Pilosella scandinavica is often found in meadows, tundra, and along coastal areas where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
