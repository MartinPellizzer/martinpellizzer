                    <h1>Polygala negevensis</h1>
<p>Polygala negevensis, commonly known as the Negev polygala, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Israel and the Negev Desert.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. It produces small, bead-like fruits that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
