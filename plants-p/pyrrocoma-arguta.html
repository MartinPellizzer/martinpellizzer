<p>Pyrrocoma arguta, commonly known as the hardy stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically in late spring or early summer. It is often found growing on cliffs, walls, or in rocky soils where it can anchor itself firmly.</p>
<p>Pyrrocoma arguta is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
