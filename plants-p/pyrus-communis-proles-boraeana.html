<p>Pyrus communis proles boraeana, commonly known as the Siberian apple, is a subspecies of the common pear native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, tart fruits that are adapted to withstand harsh winters. The plant has a compact growth habit with dark green, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>This resilient species is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in regions with short growing seasons.</p>
