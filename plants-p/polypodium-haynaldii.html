<p>Polypodium haynaldii, commonly known as the Haynald's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in areas with high air moisture.</p>
