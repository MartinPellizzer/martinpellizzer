                    <h1>Pteroneurum graecum var. lasiocarpum</h1>
<p>Pteroneurum graecum var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the Greek pteroneurum, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by unique, hairy fruits that give it its varietal name "lasiocarpum.". Its habitat is typically rocky or limestone soils, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
