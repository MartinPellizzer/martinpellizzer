                    <h1>Perymenium uxoris</h1>
<p>Perymenium uxoris, commonly known as the "wedding fern," is a rare and delicate fern species native to the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, loamy soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
