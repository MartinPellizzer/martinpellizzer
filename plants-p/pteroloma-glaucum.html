<p>Pteroloma glaucum, commonly known as the bluebush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually gray-green due to a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Pteroloma glaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climates.</p>
