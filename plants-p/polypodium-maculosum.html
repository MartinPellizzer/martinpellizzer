<p>Polypodium maculosum, commonly known as the spotted polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded spots. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
