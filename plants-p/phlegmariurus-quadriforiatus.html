<p>Phlegmariurus quadriforiatus, commonly known as the four-leaf moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, flat, green thallus that forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure composed of rhizoids and leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on rocks, soil, or decaying wood.</p>
<p>This non-vascular plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms.</p>
