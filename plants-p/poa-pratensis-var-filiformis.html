                    <h1>Poa pratensis var. filiformis</h1>
<p>Poa pratensis var. filiformis, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the standard Poa pratensis. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and as a component in turfgrass mixtures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological value in supporting pollinators.</p>
