<p>Periptera trichostemon, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Periptera trichostemon is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects.</p>
