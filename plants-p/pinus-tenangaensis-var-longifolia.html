                    <h1>Pinus tenangaensis var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Pinus tenangaensis var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf pine, is a variant of the tenangaensis pine species native to certain regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender needles, typically arranged in bundles of five, which give it a distinct appearance. The tree produces cones that are often covered in a persistent, woody bract, a feature common in many pine species. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against wildfires and environmental stress.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ecological role and timber quality, contributing to both forest ecosystems and economic activities.</p>
