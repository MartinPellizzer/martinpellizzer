                    <h1>Polygonum acaule</h1>
<p>Polygonum acaule, commonly known as the stemless knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its absence of a distinct stem, with leaves arising directly from the root system. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Polygonum acaule is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments.</p>
