                    <h1>Paspalum nesiotes</h1>
<p>Paspalum nesiotes, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in dune and beach environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to stabilize coastal soils, it plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion.</p>
