This tree is characterized by its broad leaves, sturdy trunk, and ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions. It plays a vital role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is often planted in urban areas for its shade and ornamental value.
