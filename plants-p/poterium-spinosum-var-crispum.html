                    <h1>Poterium spinosum var. crispum</h1>
<p>Poterium spinosum var. crispum, commonly known as the hairy pincushion cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, spiny structure with dense, woolly covering that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a decorative touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, while the stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique texture and ability to adapt to dry environments.</p>
