<p>Polypodium schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Polypodium schaffneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
