                    <h1>Polypodium flavopunctatum var. kaulfussii</h1>
<p>Polypodium flavopunctatum var. kaulfussii, commonly known as the Kaulfuss's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with distinctive yellow-orange spots along the veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are released from fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones.</p>
