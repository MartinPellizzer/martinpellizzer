<p>Platanthera pachyglossa var. hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo Island marsh orchid, is a rare orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as wet meadows and marshy areas. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a basal rosette, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
