                    <h1>Prosaptia rosenstockii</h1>
<p>Prosaptia rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosenthal's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with a single, slender stem and a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Prosaptia rosenstockii is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
