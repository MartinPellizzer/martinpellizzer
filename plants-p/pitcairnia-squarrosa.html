                    <h1>Pitcairnia squarrosa</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are often pink or red, are borne on a central stem and attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
