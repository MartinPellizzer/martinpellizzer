                    <h1>Poa gracillima var. saxatilis</h1>
<p>Poa gracillima var. saxatilis, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in alpine meadows and on scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
