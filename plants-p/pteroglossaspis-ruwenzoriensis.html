<p>Pteroglossaspis ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori fern, is a unique fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the East African Rift Valley.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteroglossaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and leathery fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests and rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are typical of ferns, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
