                    <h1>Pinus halepensis var. maritima</h1>
<p>Pinus halepensis var. maritima, commonly known as the Mediterranean pine, is a coastal variant of the Aleppo pine.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its adaptation to saline and arid conditions. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Aleppo pine. It produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience to coastal winds and salt spray, making it a common sight along Mediterranean shores.</p>
