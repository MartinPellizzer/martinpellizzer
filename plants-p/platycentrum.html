                    <h1>Platycentrum</h1>
<p>Platycentrum, commonly known as the golden star, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with yellow or white veins, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright orange berries, which are a key feature in its ornamental value. Platycentrum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and container cultivation.</p>
