<p>Phelipanche schultzioides, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slightly glandular surface.</p>
<p>Phelipanche schultzioides is native to regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
