                    <h1>Pontederia cordata var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Pontederia cordata var. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower pickerelweed, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
