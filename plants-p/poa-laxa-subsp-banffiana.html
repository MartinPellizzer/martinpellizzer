<p>Poa laxa subsp.</p>
<p>banffiana, commonly known as the Banff bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the alpine regions of Alberta, Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and fine, blue-green foliage that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted to pollinate by wind. It is well-suited to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
