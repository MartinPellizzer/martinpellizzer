<p>Phragmites communis proles humilis, commonly known as the dwarf common reed, is a flowering plant species belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
