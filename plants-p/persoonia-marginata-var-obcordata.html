<p>Persoonia marginata var. obcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed burr-ace, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive seed pods. The leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, woody pods that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Western Australia.</p>
