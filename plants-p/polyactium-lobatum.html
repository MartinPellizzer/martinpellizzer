<p>Polyactium lobatum, commonly known as the lobed pteridium, is a fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are bi-lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
