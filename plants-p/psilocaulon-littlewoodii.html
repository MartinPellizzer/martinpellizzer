                    <h1>Psilocaulon littlewoodii</h1>
<p>Psilocaulon littlewoodii, commonly known as the Littlewood's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions, relying on specialized symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet scent that attracts specific pollinators, such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is a subject of conservation interest.</p>
