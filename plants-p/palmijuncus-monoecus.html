                    <h1>Palmijuncus monoecus</h1>
<p>Palmijuncus monoecus, commonly known as the single-sex palm, is a unique species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its monoecious nature, meaning it has both male and female reproductive structures on the same individual. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem with a crown of elongated, sword-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing at the base of the leaf sheaths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
