                    <h1>Pelexia palmorchidis</h1>
<p>Pelexia palmorchidis, commonly known as the orchid pelexia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern to maximize light absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelexia palmorchidis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
