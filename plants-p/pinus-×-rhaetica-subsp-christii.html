<p>Pinus × rhaetica subsp.</p>
<p>christii, commonly known as the Rhaetian pine subspecies Christi, is a hybrid conifer native to the Alps. It exhibits morphological characteristics intermediate between its parent species, Pinus cembra and Pinus mugo.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its dense, slow-growing foliage and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its cones are typically small and serotinous, releasing seeds in response to fire or mechanical disturbance.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of alpine forests.</p>
