<p>Platanthera elegans subsp.</p>
<p>decurtata, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, white to pale pink floral spike that blooms in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is epiphytic, growing on the bark of trees, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
