<p>Pellaea mucronata, commonly known as the blunt-tipped fern, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorus.</p>
