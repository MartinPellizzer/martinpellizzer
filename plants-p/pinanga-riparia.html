<p>Pinanga riparia, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near rivers and streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Pinanga riparia plays a role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
