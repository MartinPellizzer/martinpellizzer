                    <h1>Poa reptans</h1>
<p>Poa reptans, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light to dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, Poa reptans is a common ornamental and turfgrass species in temperate regions.</p>
