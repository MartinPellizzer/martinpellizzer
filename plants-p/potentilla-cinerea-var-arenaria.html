                    <h1>Potentilla cinerea var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Potentilla cinerea var. arenaria, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
