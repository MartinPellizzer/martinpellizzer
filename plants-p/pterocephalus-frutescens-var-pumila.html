                    <h1>Pterocephalus frutescens var. pumila</h1>
<p>Pterocephalus frutescens var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf desert hibiscus, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in a thick layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that provides additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient example of xerophytic evolution.</p>
