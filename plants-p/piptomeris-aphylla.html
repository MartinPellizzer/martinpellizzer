<p>Piptomeris aphylla, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks true leaves.</p>
<p>It relies on its host tree for water and nutrients, while also photosynthesizing through its green stems. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that attract birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Piptomeris aphylla is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on a variety of host trees.</p>
