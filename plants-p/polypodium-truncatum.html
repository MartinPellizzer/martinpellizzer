<p>Polypodium truncatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are often covered in a thick layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive truncate (cut-off) appearance at the base, giving it its scientific name.</p>
