                    <h1>Platanthera kuenkelei var. sardoa</h1>
<p>Platanthera kuenkelei var. sardoa, commonly known as the Sardonic Lady's Tresses, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain meadows and forested areas, often in nutrient-poor soils. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
