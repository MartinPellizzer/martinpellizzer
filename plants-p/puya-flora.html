                    <h1>Puya flora</h1>
<p>Puya flora, commonly known as the "torch cactus," is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, spiny stems and large, showy inflorescences that resemble torches. Puya species are typically perennial and can grow up to several meters in height, with some varieties living for over a century. They are adapted to high-altitude environments and require well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom once in the plant's lifetime, are often brightly colored and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
