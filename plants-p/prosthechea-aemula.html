                    <h1>Prosthechea aemula</h1>
<p>Prosthechea aemula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and its ability to thrive without soil, attaching itself to trees or other plants. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers that are often described as ghost-like in appearance. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations for survival in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
