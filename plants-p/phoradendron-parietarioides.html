                    <h1>Phoradendron parietarioides</h1>
<p>Phoradendron parietarioides, commonly known as the parietary dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Santalaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in disturbed or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
