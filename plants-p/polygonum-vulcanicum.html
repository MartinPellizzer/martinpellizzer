<p>Polygonum vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic knotweed, is a perennial herb native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, rhizomatous growth and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils, often found in areas with recent volcanic activity. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and sometimes branched.</p>
<p>Polygonum vulcanicum plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed volcanic landscapes.</p>
