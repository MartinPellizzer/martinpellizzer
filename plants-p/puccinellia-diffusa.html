                    <h1>Puccinellia diffusa</h1>
<p>Puccinellia diffusa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly tolerant of saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Puccinellia diffusa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
