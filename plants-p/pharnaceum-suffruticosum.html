                    <h1>Pharnaceum suffruticosum</h1>
<p>Pharnaceum suffruticosum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy, fleshy stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence, which bloom in spring. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, adapting it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
