<p>Pentacalia trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, and prefers cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>Pentacalia trianae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
