                    <h1>Pugetia leptoclada</h1>
<p>Pugetia leptoclada, commonly known as the slender leaf pugetia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Pugetia leptoclada is considered a conservation concern.</p>
