<p>Polystichum heterolepis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with a fine layer of silvery white trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with small, spoon-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
