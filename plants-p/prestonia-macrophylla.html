<p>Prestonia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant poinciana, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates.</p>
