<p>Plantago albicans var. desertica, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its extensive root system allows it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
