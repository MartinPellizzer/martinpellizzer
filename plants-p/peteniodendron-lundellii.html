                    <h1>Peteniodendron lundellii</h1>
<p>Peteniodendron lundellii, commonly known as the Guatemalan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
