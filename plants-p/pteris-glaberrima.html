<p>Pteris glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris glaberrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
