<p>Parodia nothominuscula, commonly known as the miniature parodia, is a small, globular cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often has a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
