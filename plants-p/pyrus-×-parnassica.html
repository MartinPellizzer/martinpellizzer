                    <h1>Pyrus × parnassica</h1>
<p>Pyrus × parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus amygdaliformis and Pyrus communis.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Parnassus range in Greece. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a silvery underside, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring.</p>
<p>The fruit is typically small, with a sweet, aromatic flavor, making it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
