                    <h1>Phalaridium</h1>
<p>Phalaridium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline or brackish environments. They are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Phalaridium species often have a creeping growth habit, allowing them to colonize sandy or shelly shores.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually green or blue in color and are pollinated by wind or insects.</p>
