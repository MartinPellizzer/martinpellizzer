<p>Polypodium sepultum, commonly known as the buried fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and unique, often clustered growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, sometimes curled appearance. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
