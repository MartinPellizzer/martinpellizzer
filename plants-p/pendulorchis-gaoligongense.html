<p>Pendulorchis gaoligongense, commonly known as the Gaoligong Mountains orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear delicate, colorful flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocky substrates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection.</p>
