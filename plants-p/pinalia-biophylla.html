                    <h1>Pinalia biophylla</h1>
<p>Pinalia biophylla, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds.</p>
<p>Native to the misty highlands of the Andes, it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Its leaves emit a soft blue glow at night, a trait attributed to specialized chloroplasts containing luciferin. The plant's root system is highly adapted to nutrient-poor soils, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its rare habitat and fragile nature, Pinalia biophylla is considered an endangered species.</p>
