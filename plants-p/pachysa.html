<p>Pachysa, commonly known as the thick-leafed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, succulent leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that often feature yellow centers and white or pink petals. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, Pachysa species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plants typically have a basal rosette growth habit, with leaves that store water to reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
