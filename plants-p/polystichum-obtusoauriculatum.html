                    <h1>Polystichum obtusoauriculatum</h1>
<p>Polystichum obtusoauriculatum, commonly known as the broad-auricle wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, upright growth habit.</p>
