                    <h1>Pistia natalensis</h1>
<p>Pistia natalensis, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has broad, waxy, light green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Pistia natalensis is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions.</p>
