                    <h1>Prasophyllum graniticola</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum graniticola, commonly known as the granite leek, is a rare orchid species native to the granite outcrops of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of grass-like leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land disturbance.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
