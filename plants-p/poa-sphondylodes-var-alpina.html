<p>Poa sphondylodes var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and slender, blue-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in rocky and nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
