                    <h1>Panax ornatus</h1>
<p>Panax ornatus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, yellowish roots and lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested regions. Its medicinal properties are attributed to the presence of ginsenosides, which are bioactive compounds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
