<p>Psacalium peltatum var. conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatti's peltate hibiscus, is a rare variant of the peltate hibiscus native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species.</p>
