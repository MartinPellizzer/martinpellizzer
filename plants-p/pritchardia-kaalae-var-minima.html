                    <h1>Pritchardia kaalae var. minima</h1>
<p>Pritchardia kaalae var. minima, commonly known as the Haleakala pine, is a rare and critically endangered cycad native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically yellow when mature. It thrives in the wet, volcanic soils of the Haleakala National Park on the island of Maui.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, its population has drastically declined, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
