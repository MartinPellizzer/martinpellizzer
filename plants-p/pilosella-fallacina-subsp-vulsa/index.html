                            <h1>Pilosella Fallacina Subsp. Vulsa</h1>
<p>Pilosella hawkweed, scientifically known as Pilosella fallacina subsp. vulsa, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in open meadows and scree slopes at high elevations. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, making it easily recognizable among other members of the Asteraceae family. Despite its modest size, Pilosella hawkweed plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its habitat.</p>
