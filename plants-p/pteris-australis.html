                    <h1>Pteris australis</h1>
<p>Pteris australis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across wetlands.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
