<p>Phragmites nagus, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It has long, slender leaves and produces feathery, spike-like flowers that are highly visible during the summer months. This plant is known for its extensive rhizome system, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense colonies. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
