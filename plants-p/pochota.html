<p>Pochota, commonly known as the "chocolate tree," is a species native to Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to purple flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain small, dark brown seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Pochota is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically grown for its fruit or seeds due to their limited commercial use.</p>
