                    <h1>Perymenium yanezii</h1>
<p>Perymenium yanezii, commonly known as the Yanezii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in countries like Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
