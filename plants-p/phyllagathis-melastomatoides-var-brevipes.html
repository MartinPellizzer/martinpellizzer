                    <h1>Phyllagathis melastomatoides var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Phyllagathis melastomatoides var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered, small white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized roots called haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
