                            <h1>Pedicularis Jainii Subsp. Multiflora</h1>
<p>Pedicularis jainii subsp. multiflora is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family known for its vivid orange-red flowers. Native to the alpine regions of the Indian subcontinent, this subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations. Its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts. Despite its beauty, it remains poorly documented due to its limited distribution and elusive habitat. This plant serves as an important indicator of ecological health in its native ecosystems.</p>
