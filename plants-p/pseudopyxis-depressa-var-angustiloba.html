<p>Pseudopyxis depressa var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pseudopyxis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its small, crustose thallus that forms a dense, foliose structure. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with narrow, elongated lobes that are often covered in a layer of fine, powdery substances. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on rock surfaces or tree trunks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
