<p>Periploca forsteri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Periploca forsteri plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments.</p>
