<p>Prumnopitys andina, commonly known as the Andean silver fir, is a coniferous tree native to the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Prumnopitys andina thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing above the tree line in temperate to cold climates.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various alpine species and contributing to the biodiversity of mountainous regions.</p>
