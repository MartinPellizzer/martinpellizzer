                    <h1>Plesioneuron translucens var. seramense</h1>
<p>Plesioneuron translucens var. seramense, commonly known as the Seram translucent moss, is a rare and delicate species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, translucent leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, waxy secretions. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense, carpet-like mats on rocks or decaying wood.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, moist ecosystems.</p>
