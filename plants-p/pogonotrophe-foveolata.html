                    <h1>Pogonotrophe foveolata</h1>
<p>Pogonotrophe foveolata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pogonotrophe foveolata is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
