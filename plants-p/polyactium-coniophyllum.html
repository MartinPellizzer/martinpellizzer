                    <h1>Polyactium coniophyllum</h1>
<p>Polyactium coniophyllum, commonly known as the conical polypore, is a species of bracket fungus belonging to the family Polyporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive conical or cushion-like shape and a tough, leathery cap that is typically reddish-brown in color. The fungus grows on dead wood, particularly in temperate forests, and plays a role in decomposing organic matter. Its spore-producing surface, or hymenium, is located on the underside of the cap and is often covered with small, round pores.</p>
<p>This species is valued in mycology for its unique morphology and ecological significance in forest ecosystems.</p>
