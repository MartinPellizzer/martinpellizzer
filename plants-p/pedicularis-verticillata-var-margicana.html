                    <h1>Pedicularis verticillata var. margicana</h1>
<p>Pedicularis verticillata var. margicana, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
