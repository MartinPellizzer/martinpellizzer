<p>Persicaria cochinchinensis, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands and streambanks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both an invasive species in some regions and a valuable plant in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel.</p>
