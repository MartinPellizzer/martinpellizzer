                    <h1>Podophorus</h1>
<p>Podophorus, commonly known as the mayapple, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive umbrella-shaped leaf arrangement and produces a yellowish-green flower that develops into a red, fleshy fruit. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its roots and berries, which can be harmful if ingested. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its use is now limited due to its toxicity.</p>
