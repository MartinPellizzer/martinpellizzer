                    <h1>Pottsia densiflora</h1>
<p>Pottsia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered pottsia, is a rare and delicate fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its finely divided, glossy green fronds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically found on the underside of the leaves. Pottsia densiflora thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
