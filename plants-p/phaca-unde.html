                    <h1>Phaca unde</h1>
<p>Phaca unde, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a delicate and rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, almost lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Phaca unde is considered endangered and is protected in many conservation areas.</p>
