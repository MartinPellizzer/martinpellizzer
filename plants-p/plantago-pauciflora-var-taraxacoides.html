                    <h1>Plantago pauciflora var. taraxacoides</h1>
<p>Plantago pauciflora var. taraxacoides, commonly known as the slender plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a dense spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced flower number and slender morphology compared to other Plantago species.</p>
