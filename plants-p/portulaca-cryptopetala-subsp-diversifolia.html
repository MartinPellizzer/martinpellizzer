<p>Portulaca cryptopetala subsp.</p>
<p>diversifolia, commonly known as the variable portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are typically alternate and may vary in shape, giving rise to its subspecies name *diversifolia*.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
