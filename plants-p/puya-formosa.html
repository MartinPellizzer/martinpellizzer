<p>Puya formosa, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, protective structure around its central flower stalk. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, are highly ornamental and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, Puya formosa is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a symbol of the Andean landscape.</p>
