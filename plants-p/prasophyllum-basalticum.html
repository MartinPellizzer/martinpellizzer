                    <h1>Prasophyllum basalticum</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum basalticum, commonly known as the basalt leek, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or volcanic substrates. Its growth is closely tied to specific microhabitats, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Prasophyllum basalticum plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems.</p>
