                    <h1>Ptychosperma filiferum</h1>
<p>Ptychosperma filiferum, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is known for its slow growth and can live for hundreds of years, making it a significant component of its native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in some areas.</p>
