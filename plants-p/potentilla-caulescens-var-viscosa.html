<p>Potentilla caulescens var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, often hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are typically compound, with five oval leaflets that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its sticky foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
