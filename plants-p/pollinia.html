                    <h1>Pollinia</h1>
<p>Pollinia, commonly known as pollen masses, are specialized structures found in certain flowering plants, particularly in orchids.</p>
<p>They consist of compact, sticky masses of pollen grains that are often enclosed in a cohesive sheath. These structures are adapted for efficient pollination by insects or other pollinators. The unique morphology of pollinia allows for precise transfer to the stigma of compatible flowers.</p>
<p>Botanically, they represent an advanced adaptation in the reproductive strategy of some plant species.</p>
