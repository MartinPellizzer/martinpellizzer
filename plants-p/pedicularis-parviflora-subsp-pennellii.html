<p>pennellii, commonly known as the small-flowered lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants.</p>
<p>The species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred structure that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>The subspecies pennellii is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to other subspecies of Pedicularis parviflora.</p>
