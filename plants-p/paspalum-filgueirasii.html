<p>Paspalum filgueirasii, commonly known as the Filgueira paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
