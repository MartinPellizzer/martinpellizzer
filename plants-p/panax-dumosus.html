                    <h1>Panax dumosus</h1>
<p>Panax dumosus, commonly known as the dwarf ginseng, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its roots, which are similar in appearance to those of Panax ginseng, are often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Panax dumosus is considered an endangered species.</p>
