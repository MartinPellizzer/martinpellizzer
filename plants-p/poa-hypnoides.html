                    <h1>Poa hypnoides</h1>
<p>Poa hypnoides, commonly known as the moss grass or creeping meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Poa hypnoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland habitats.</p>
