<p>Pinus × rhaetica nothosubsp.</p>
<p>digenea, commonly known as the Rhaetian pine, is a hybrid conifer native to the Alps. It is a sterile hybrid between Pinus cembra and Pinus mugo, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of its parent species. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in subalpine and alpine regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in mountainous ecosystems.</p>
