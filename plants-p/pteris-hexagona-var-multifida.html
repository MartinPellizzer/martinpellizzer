                    <h1>Pteris hexagona var. multifida</h1>
<p>Pteris hexagona var. multifida, commonly known as the feather-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with multiple divisions creating a complex, lace-like pattern.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
