<p>Panicum breviglume, commonly known as little barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows, thriving in environments with high humidity. Its botanical features include narrow, parallel-veined leaves and a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Panicum breviglume is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to prevent erosion and support biodiversity.</p>
