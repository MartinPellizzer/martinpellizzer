<p>Pteris striphnophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20â€“40 cm long. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces numerous erect, spore-bearing fiddleheads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its fronds are covered in fine, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory.</p>
