                    <h1>Platanthera mandarinorum var. delavayi</h1>
<p>Platanthera mandarinorum var. delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's Mandarin Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often near streams or in mossy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
