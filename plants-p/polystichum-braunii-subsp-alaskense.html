<p>Polystichum braunii subsp.</p>
<p>alaskense, commonly known as the Alaska barren gall, is a fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically evergreen and persist through the winter.</p>
<p>The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
