                    <h1>Pachylophus glaber</h1>
<p>Pachylophus glaber, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed pachylophus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, often woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite inflorescences, which are typical of the daisy family. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in temperate and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pachylophus glaber is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
