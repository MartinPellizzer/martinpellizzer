                    <h1>Poa abortiva</h1>
<p>Poa abortiva, commonly known as the abortive bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairless leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Botanically, Poa abortiva is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which can contribute to soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
