                    <h1>Pseudobastardia tiubae</h1>
<p>Pseudobastardia tiubae, commonly known as the Tiubae's pseudobastard, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing yellow ray florets surrounded by brown disk florets.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
