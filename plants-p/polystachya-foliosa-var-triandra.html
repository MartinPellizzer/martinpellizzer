<p>Polystachya foliosa var. triandra, commonly known as the triandra orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branched inflorescence and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
