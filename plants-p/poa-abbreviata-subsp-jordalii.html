<p>Poa abbreviata subsp.</p>
<p>jordalii, commonly known as Jordan's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
