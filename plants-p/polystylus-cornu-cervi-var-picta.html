<p>Polystylus cornu-cervi var. picta, commonly known as the painted horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, horn-like spur that serves as a nectar source for its pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific insect pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
