                    <h1>Paphiopedilum × trantuanii</h1>
<p>Paphiopedilum × trantuanii, commonly known as the Trantuan hybrid orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Paphiopedilum sukhakulii and Paphiopedilum niveum.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its elongated, fleshy roots and its unique, slipper-shaped flower structure, which is a hallmark of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant typically produces pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip that serves as a trap for pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes but remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
