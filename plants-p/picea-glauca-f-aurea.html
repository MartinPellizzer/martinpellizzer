                    <h1>Picea glauca f. aurea</h1>
<p>Picea glauca f. aurea, commonly known as the white spruce variegated form, is a variant of the white spruce tree native to North America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, which features a mix of white, yellow, and green tones on its needles. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in reduced photosynthetic efficiency. It typically grows in cooler climates and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is relatively slow-growing and can be sensitive to environmental stressors.</p>
