<p>Parasenecio quinquelobus var. quinquelobus, commonly known as the five-lobed cudweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-hairy leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
