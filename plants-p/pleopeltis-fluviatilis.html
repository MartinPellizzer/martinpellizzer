<p>Pleopeltis fluviatilis, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for small invertebrates and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
