                    <h1>Platyopuntia ficus-indica</h1>
<p>Platyopuntia ficus-indica, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits called tunas. Its spiny leaves provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The cactus also plays an important ecological role by supporting various pollinators and desert wildlife.</p>
