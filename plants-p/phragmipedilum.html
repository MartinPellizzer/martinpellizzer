                    <h1>Phragmipedilum</h1>
<p>Phragmipedilum, commonly known as the lady's slipper orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive slipper-shaped petals, which are often brightly colored and highly specialized for pollination. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they rely on specific environmental conditions to thrive. Native to Southeast Asia, they are found in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and rainfall.</p>
<p>Their unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make them both ornamental and ecologically significant.</p>
