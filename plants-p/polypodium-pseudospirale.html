<p>Polypodium pseudospirale, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral arrangement of fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
