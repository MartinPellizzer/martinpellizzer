                    <h1>Phornothamnus</h1>
<p>Phornothamnus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance, hence their common name. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Phornothamnus species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in high humidity.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching, contributing to their intricate and ornamental appearance.</p>
