                    <h1>Polypodium bombycinum var. insularum</h1>
<p>Polypodium bombycinum var. insularum, commonly known as the island holly fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific island habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a rough texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical or subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
