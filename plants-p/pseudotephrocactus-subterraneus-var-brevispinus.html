<p>Pseudotephrocactus subterraneus var. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined subterranean cactus, is a unique cactus species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, spiny stems that grow close to the ground, adapted to its arid and rocky habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb water from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
