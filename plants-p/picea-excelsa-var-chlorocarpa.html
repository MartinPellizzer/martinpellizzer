                    <h1>Picea excelsa var. chlorocarpa</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and conical shape, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The leaves are typically shorter and more closely packed compared to the standard white spruce, providing better insulation against cold temperatures. This variety is often found in high-altitude forests, where it plays a crucial role in ecosystem stability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
