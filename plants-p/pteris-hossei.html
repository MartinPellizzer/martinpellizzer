                    <h1>Pteris hossei</h1>
<p>Pteris hossei, commonly known as the Hossi's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris hossei is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention.</p>
