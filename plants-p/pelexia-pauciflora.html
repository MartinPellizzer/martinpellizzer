<p>Pelexia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that often grow in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Pelexia pauciflora is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes.</p>
