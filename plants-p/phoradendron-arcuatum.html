                    <h1>Phoradendron arcuatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron arcuatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to survive without soil makes it a unique example of parasitic adaptation in the botanical world.</p>
