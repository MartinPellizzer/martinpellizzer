                    <h1>Parnassia palustris f. minima</h1>
<p>Parnassia palustris f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf marsh gentian, is a variant of the marsh gentian that exhibits smaller floral structures compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and moist meadows in North America. The plant features showy, blue to white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in nutrient-poor soils and thrives in environments with consistent moisture.</p>
