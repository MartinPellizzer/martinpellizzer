<p>Parodia fechseri, commonly known as the "Cushion Cactus," is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and dense clusters of small, green to blue-green stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Parodia fechseri is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
