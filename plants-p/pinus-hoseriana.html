                    <h1>Pinus hoseriana</h1>
<p>Pinus hoseriana, commonly known as the Hoser's pine, is a rare and critically endangered species native to a small region in central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, dark purple cones that mature over several years, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
