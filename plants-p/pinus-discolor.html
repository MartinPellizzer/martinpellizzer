                    <h1>Pinus discolor</h1>
<p>Pinus discolor, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white to gray bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its serotinous cones that open only after exposure to heat, typically from a forest fire. The tree produces edible seeds called pine nuts, which are encased in its woody cones. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and vulnerability to diseases like white pine blister rust, it is a significant species in forest ecosystems.</p>
