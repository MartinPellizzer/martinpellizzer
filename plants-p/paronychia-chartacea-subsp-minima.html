<p>Paronychia chartacea subsp.</p>
<p>minima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its compact growth form and drought tolerance make it well adapted to its native ecosystem.</p>
