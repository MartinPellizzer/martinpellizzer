                            <h1>Phymatodes Rupestris</h1>
<p>Texas knapweed, scientifically known as Phymatodes rupestris, is a hardy perennial plant native to the arid regions of Texas and surrounding areas. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. This plant is characterized by its low-growing structure, with gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Despite its resilience, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, posing challenges to native vegetation. Its unique adaptations make it an important subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
