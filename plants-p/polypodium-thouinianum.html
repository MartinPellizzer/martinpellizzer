<p>Polypodium thouinianum, commonly known as the Thouin's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, marshes, and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
