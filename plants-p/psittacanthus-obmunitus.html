                    <h1>Psittacanthus obmunitus</h1>
<p>Psittacanthus obmunitus, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of cycad that is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, clustered stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
