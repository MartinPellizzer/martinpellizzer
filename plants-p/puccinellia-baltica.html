<p>Puccinellia baltica, commonly known as Baltic glassworts, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in marshes and tidal flats. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in its saline environment. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Puccinellia baltica plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
