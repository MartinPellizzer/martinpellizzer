                    <h1>Peperomia parvifolia</h1>
<p>Peperomia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance houseplant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, reddish-brown spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typical of the Piperaceae family. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it ideal for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for tabletop displays and hanging baskets.</p>
