<p>Parodiophyllochloa penicillata, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy.</p>
