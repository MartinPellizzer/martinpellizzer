                    <h1>Plantago nubicola</h1>
<p>Plantago nubicola, commonly known as the highland plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found at high altitudes where other plants struggle to survive. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in a spike and are typically greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>This resilient species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
