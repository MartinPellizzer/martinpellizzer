                    <h1>Pulicaria fetida</h1>
<p>Pulicaria fetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in dense, spherical heads. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its pungent odor, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
