                    <h1>Platyloma hastatum</h1>
<p>Platyloma hastatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters and features lance-shaped, smooth, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Platyloma hastatum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
