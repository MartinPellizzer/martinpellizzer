                    <h1>Phoradendron densum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron densum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is known for its ecological role in supporting bird populations.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both a valuable and potentially harmful species.</p>
