<p>Porlieria chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean porlieria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweeds. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a distinctive whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
