                    <h1>Pitcairnia tatzyanae</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia tatzyanae, commonly known as the Tatziana pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which is used by the plant for hydration. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
