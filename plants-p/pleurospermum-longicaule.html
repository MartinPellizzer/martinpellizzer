                    <h1>Pleurospermum longicaule</h1>
<p>Pleurospermum longicaule, commonly known as the narrowleaf pleurospermum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly woolly texture, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Pleurospermum longicaule is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
