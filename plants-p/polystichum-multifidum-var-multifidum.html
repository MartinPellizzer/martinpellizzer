                    <h1>Polystichum multifidum var. multifidum</h1>
<p>Polystichum multifidum var. multifidum, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features elegant, bipinnate fronds that are dark green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing sori are clustered on the underside of the fronds, characteristic of the fern family.</p>
