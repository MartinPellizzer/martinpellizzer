                    <h1>Primula calderiana var. acaulescens</h1>
<p>Primula calderiana var. acaulescens, commonly known as the slender primrose, is a rare and unique plant native to high-altitude regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves forming a rosette near the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
