<p>Polypodium honolulense, commonly known as the Hawaiian water fern, is a rare fern species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lyrate-shaped fronds that are typically light green in color. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in streamside habitats and rocky areas. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
