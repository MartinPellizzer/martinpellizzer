                    <h1>Poa pratensis f. prolifera</h1>
<p>Poa pratensis f. prolifera, commonly known as the spreading meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to form dense, mat-like growth through stolons, which allows it to spread rapidly across open ground. This form is often found in moist, temperate regions where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover.</p>
