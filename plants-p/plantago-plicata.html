                    <h1>Plantago plicata</h1>
<p>Plantago plicata, commonly known as the narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
