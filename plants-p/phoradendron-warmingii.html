<p>Phoradendron warmingii, commonly known as the Florida mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees in the southeastern United States.</p>

The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically red or yellow and are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>The species plays a unique ecological role in its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
