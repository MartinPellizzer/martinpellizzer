                    <h1>Pythagorea</h1>
<p>Pythagorea, commonly known as the Pythagorean plant, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to flourish. Its name is derived from its historical association with ancient Greek mathematicians, who believed it held symbolic significance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, Pythagorea is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
