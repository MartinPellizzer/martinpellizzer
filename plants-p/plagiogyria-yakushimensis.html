                    <h1>Plagiogyria yakushimensis</h1>
<p>Plagiogyria yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushiman Islands lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to blackish thallus with a distinctive, wrinkled surface. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to efficiently absorb nutrients from the environment. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in the subtropical regions of Japan.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
