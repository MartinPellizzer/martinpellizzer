<p>Paepalanthus granatensis, commonly known as the granadino cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with pale green stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
