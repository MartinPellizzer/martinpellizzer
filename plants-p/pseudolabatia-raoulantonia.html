<p>Pseudolabatia raoulantonia, commonly known as the Raoul's false labatia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lanceolate leaves that are hairy on the underside. Its flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
