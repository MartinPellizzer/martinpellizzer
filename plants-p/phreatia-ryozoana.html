                    <h1>Phreatia ryozoana</h1>
<p>Phreatia ryozoana, commonly known as the Ryozo's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, emit a faint fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and fragility, Phreatia ryozoana is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
