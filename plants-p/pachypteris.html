<p>Pachypteris, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, leathery fronds and are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the genus its name. Pachypteris species often thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them important components of their native ecosystems.</p>
