<p>Potamopitys triandra, commonly known as the African mountain pine, is a coniferous tree native to the highlands of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of conifers. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
