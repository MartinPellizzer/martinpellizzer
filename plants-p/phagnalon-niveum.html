<p>Phagnalon niveum, commonly known as snowbed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-white foliage, which helps it withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Phagnalon niveum plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments and is adapted to low light conditions.</p>
