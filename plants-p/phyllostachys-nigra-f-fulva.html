<p>Phyllostachys nigra f. fulva, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a variegated form of the black bamboo species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-green to golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the darker stems of its parent species. This plant is a clump-forming grass that produces tall, slender culms with a smooth, almost woody texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
