                    <h1>Phthirusa pauciflora</h1>
<p>Phthirusa pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered phthirusa, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a compact, low-growing form, making it well-suited for rock gardens or dry environments. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
