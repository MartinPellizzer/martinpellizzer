                    <h1>Pleopeltis linearis var. steniste</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis linearis var. steniste, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern characterized by its linear, narrow leaves that are often densely packed.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, elongated shape that helps it conserve moisture. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
