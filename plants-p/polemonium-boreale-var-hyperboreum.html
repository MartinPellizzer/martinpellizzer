                    <h1>Polemonium boreale var. hyperboreum</h1>
<p>Polemonium boreale var. hyperboreum, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to low-light conditions typical of tundra habitats. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is an important component of Arctic flora, contributing to the ecological balance of its harsh environment.</p>
