                    <h1>Polygonum viviparum f. alpinum</h1>
<p>Polygonum viviparum f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces viviparous offspring, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant, aiding in its propagation in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain tundra.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, nutrient-poor conditions typical of alpine ecosystems.</p>
