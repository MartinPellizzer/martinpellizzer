                    <h1>Pycreus substellatus</h1>
<p>Pycreus substellatus, commonly known as the starry pycreus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disc florets. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pycreus substellatus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
