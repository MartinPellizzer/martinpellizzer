<p>Pipturus vaihirianensis, commonly known as the Vaihiria fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing in shaded forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in the region.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
