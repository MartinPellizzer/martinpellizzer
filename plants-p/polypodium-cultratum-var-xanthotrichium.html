<p>Polypodium cultratum var. xanthotrichium, commonly known as the golden-hair fern, is a variant of the sword fern characterized by its distinctive fronds.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a serrated margin, with the lower surface often bearing golden-brown hairs, which give it its common name. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage.</p>
