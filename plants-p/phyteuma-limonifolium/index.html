                            <h1>Phyteuma Limonifolium</h1>
<p>Phyteuma limonifolium is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family known for its vibrant yellow flowers and distinctive lemon-scented leaves. Native to southern Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays. The plant's name derives from the Latin words for "lemon leaf," reflecting its aromatic foliage. With its delicate blooms and hardy nature, Phyteuma limonifolium is both a botanical wonder and a horticultural delight.</p>
