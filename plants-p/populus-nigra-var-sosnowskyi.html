<p>Populus nigra var. sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's willow, is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
