                    <h1>Pachylarnax omeiensis</h1>
<p>Pachylarnax omeiensis, commonly known as the Sichuan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to the subtropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
