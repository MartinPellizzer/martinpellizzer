<p>Peucedanum nudicaule var. ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf cowparsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring slender, erect stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are slender, ribbed schizocarps that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
