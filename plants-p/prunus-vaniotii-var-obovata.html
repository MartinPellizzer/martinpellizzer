<p>Prunus vaniotii var. obovata, commonly known as the obovate Prunus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosaceae family.</p>

The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible drupes that are often used in traditional medicine. Native to specific regions of China, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
