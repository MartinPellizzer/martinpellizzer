<p>Psilocarphus tenellus, commonly known as the slender psilocarphus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers, which are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. Psilocarphus tenellus is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range.</p>
