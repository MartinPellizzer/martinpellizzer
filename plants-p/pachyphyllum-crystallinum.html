                    <h1>Pachyphyllum crystallinum</h1>
<p>Pachyphyllum crystallinum, commonly known as the crystalline stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss and reflects sunlight. Its flowers are small and typically yellow or green, appearing in clusters during the growing season.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking addition to rock gardens or xeriscaped landscapes.</p>
