                    <h1>Pteridium ceheginense</h1>
<p>Pteridium ceheginense, commonly known as the Ceheg√≠n fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
