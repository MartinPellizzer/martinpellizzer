                    <h1>Prenanthes vulgaris</h1>
<p>Prenanthes vulgaris, commonly known as the common water hemlock, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, but it is highly toxic due to the presence of cicutoxin. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid contact with any part of the plant.</p>
