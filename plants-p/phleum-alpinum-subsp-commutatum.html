<p>Phleum alpinum subsp.</p>
<p>commutatum, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
