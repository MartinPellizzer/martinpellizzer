                            <h1>Potentilla Verna Subsp. Serotina</h1>
<p>Spring cinquefoil, scientifically known as Potentilla verna subsp. serotina, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, making it a striking addition to mountain landscapes. Its common name reflects its early blooming habit, which occurs before many other flowering plants. Despite its delicate appearance, the Spring cinquefoil is resilient and plays an important role in its ecosystem.</p>
