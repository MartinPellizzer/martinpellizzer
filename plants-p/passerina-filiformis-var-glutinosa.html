                    <h1>Passerina filiformis var. glutinosa</h1>
<p>Passerina filiformis var. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky threadleaf, is a variant of the threadleaf plant characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are covered in a sticky substance, which is a notable botanical feature of this variety. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its reduced leaf surface. The plant belongs to the Passerina genus, which is part of the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation strategies make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
