                    <h1>Pseudoselago hilliardiae</h1>
<p>Pseudoselago hilliardiae, commonly known as the Hilliard's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, delicate leaves and has a specialized mycorrhizal relationship with certain fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the understorey of dense rainforest.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
