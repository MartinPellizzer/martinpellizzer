<p>Poterium sanguisorba subsp.</p>
<p>obscurum, commonly known as black-root sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish-brown in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
