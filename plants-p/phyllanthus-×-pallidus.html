                    <h1>Phyllanthus × pallidus</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus × pallidus, commonly known as the pale phyllanthus, is a hybrid shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
