<p>Pseudolysimachion borysthenicum, commonly known as the Crimean sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to the dry, temperate climate of its native region. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
