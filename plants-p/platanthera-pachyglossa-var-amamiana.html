                    <h1>Platanthera pachyglossa var. amamiana</h1>
<p>Platanthera pachyglossa var. amamiana, commonly known as the Amami orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily on the islands of Amami ÅŒshima and Okinoshima in Japan.</p>
<p>This orchid is characterized by its slender, erect stem and its strikingly long, narrow, white to pale pink flowers. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant has a short flowering period, typically in late spring to early summer, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
