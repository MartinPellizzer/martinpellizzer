<p>Phycoschoenus, commonly known as the marsh grass or reed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, often growing in wetland or marshy environments. The plant typically produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Phycoschoenus species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
