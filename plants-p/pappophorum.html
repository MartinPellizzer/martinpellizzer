                    <h1>Pappophorum</h1>
<p>Pappophorum, commonly known as the cockspur grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spike-like inflorescence and small, wind-dispersed seeds called pappi, which aid in its propagation. The plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Pappophorum species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them an important component of desert and grassland ecosystems.</p>
