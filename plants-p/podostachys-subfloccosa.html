                    <h1>Podostachys subfloccosa</h1>
<p>Podostachys subfloccosa, commonly known as the woolly spikegrass, is a unique aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance due to the fine, hair-like structures covering its stems and leaves. The plant has specialized root systems that anchor it to rocky substrates, allowing it to thrive in turbulent waters. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Podostachys subfloccosa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish species.</p>
