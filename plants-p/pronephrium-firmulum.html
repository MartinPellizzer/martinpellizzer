                    <h1>Pronephrium firmulum</h1>
<p>Pronephrium firmulum, commonly known as the hardy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, often submerged leaves. The plant is known for its ability to trap small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures called vesicles. These vesicles are used to capture prey, which the plant then digests for nutrients.</p>
<p>Pronephrium firmulum is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches.</p>
