                    <h1>Pterocephalus shepardii</h1>
<p>Pterocephalus shepardii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Pterocephalus shepardii is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
