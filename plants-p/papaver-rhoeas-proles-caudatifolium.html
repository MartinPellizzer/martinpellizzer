                    <h1>Papaver rhoeas proles caudatifolium</h1>
<p>Papaver rhoeas proles caudatifolium, commonly known as the caudate-leaved poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and open fields. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers with a prominent central stigma, which are highly visible and attract pollinators. Its foliage is often more elongated and lobed compared to the standard Papaver rhoeas, giving it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>This botanical variant is of interest in horticulture and botanical studies due to its ornamental value and genetic variability.</p>
