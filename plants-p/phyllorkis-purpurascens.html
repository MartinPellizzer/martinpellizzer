<p>Phyllorkis purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique coloration and structure make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical study.</p>
