<p>Polypodium rhomboideum, commonly known as the rhomboid fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rhombic-shaped fronds, which are usually leathery and have a dark green color. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium rhomboideum is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
