<p>Polypodium organense, commonly known as the Organ Mountains huperzia, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has a preference for sunny to partially shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium organense plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid conditions.</p>
