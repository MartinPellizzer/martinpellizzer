                    <h1>Phoradendron tetracarpum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tetracarpum, commonly known as the four-fruit mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a role in ecological interactions within forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also contributes to biodiversity by supporting various wildlife species.</p>
