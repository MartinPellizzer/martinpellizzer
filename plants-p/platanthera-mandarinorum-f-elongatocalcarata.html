                    <h1>Platanthera mandarinorum f. elongatocalcarata</h1>
<p>Platanthera mandarinorum f. elongatocalcarata, commonly known as the elongated spur orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, particularly the elongated spur that extends from the base of the flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a delicate appearance that sets it apart from other orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this orchid is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
