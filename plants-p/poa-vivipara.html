<p>Poa vivipara, commonly known as the livefoot grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the production of bulbils along its stolons, which allows for vegetative propagation. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Poa vivipara is often found in low-nutrient soils and is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
