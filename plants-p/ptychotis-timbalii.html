                    <h1>Ptychotis timbalii</h1>
<p>Ptychotis timbalii, commonly known as the Timbalii's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees.</p>
