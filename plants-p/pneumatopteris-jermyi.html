<p>Pneumatopteris jermyi, commonly known as the Jermy's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for underwater growth. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
