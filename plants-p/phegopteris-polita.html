                    <h1>Phegopteris polita</h1>
<p>Phegopteris polita, commonly known as the silky cliffbrake, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a soft, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliff faces, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Phegopteris polita plays a role in stabilizing soil on steep terrain and supports local biodiversity.</p>
