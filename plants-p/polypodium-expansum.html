<p>Polypodium expansum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a tropical fern species native to regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both roots and new fronds. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Polypodium expansum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
