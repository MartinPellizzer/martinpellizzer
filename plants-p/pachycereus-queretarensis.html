<p>Pachycereus queretarensis, commonly known as the Quer√©taro prickly pear, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a tall, unbranched stem with a ribbed structure that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a "tuna," is edible and has a sweet, fleshy pulp.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in desert ecosystems.</p>
