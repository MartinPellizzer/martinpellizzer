                    <h1>Potentilla × ilvensis</h1>
<p>Potentilla × ilvensis, commonly known as the silverweed, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and a mat-forming growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically silver-gray in color, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Potentilla × ilvensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
