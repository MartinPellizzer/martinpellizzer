<p>Pyrrosia foveolata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, delicate fronds with a distinctive, foveolate (pitted) appearance on the underside. Its spores are released from sori that are closely clustered on the leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>Pyrrosia foveolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
