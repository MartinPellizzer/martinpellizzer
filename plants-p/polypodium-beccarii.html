<p>Polypodium beccarii, commonly known as the beccari fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.
