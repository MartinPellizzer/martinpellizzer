<p>Pteropsis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, often lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. Pteropsis species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. They have rhizomatous growth habits and produce spores on the underside of their fronds.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with unique foliage patterns and ecological adaptations.</p>
