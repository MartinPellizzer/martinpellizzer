                    <h1>Pseudostellaria palibiniana f. hallasanensis</h1>
<p>Pseudostellaria palibiniana f. hallasanensis, commonly known as the Hallasan mountain starwort, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Jeju in South Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, pale green to blue-green leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, typically on the slopes of Mount Hallasan.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
