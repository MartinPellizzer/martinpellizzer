                    <h1>Podocarpium podocarpum</h1>
<p>Podocarpium podocarpum, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green needles that are arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>The tree plays a vital role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and providing habitat for various alpine species.</p>
