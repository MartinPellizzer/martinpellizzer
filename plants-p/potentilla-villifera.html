                    <h1>Potentilla villifera</h1>
<p>Potentilla villifera, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
