<p>Platanthera bifolia subsp.</p>
<p>atropatanica, commonly known as the black marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and striking, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological dependence on fungal associations. It thrives in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in sphagnum moss-dominated environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
