<p>Pygeum oocarpum, commonly known as the African wild almond, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, round, orange-red fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, woody shell. Pygeum oocarpum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought resistance through its deep root system and waxy leaf surface.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses.</p>
