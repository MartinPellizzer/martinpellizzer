                    <h1>Pinaropappus diguetii</h1>
<p>Pinaropappus diguetii, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and scale-like leaves that are adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to the harsh environmental conditions of Socotra.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies.</p>
