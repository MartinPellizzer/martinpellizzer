                    <h1>Photinia undulata</h1>
<p>Photinia undulata, commonly known as the glossy leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that turn red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
