                    <h1>Potentilla fragiformis var. gelida</h1>
<p>Potentilla fragiformis var. gelida, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in alpine tundra and mountain meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
