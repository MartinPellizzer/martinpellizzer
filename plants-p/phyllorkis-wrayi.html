<p>Phyllorkis wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater environments such as streams and lakes, where it thrives in slow-moving water. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged, contributing to its delicate appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Phyllorkis wrayi plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
