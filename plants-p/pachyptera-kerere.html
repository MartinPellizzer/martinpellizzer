                    <h1>Pachyptera kerere</h1>
<p>Pachyptera kerere, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small, shrub-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in local communities.</p>
