<p>Platanthera bifolia subsp.</p>
<p>chlorantha, commonly known as the greenish lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded habitats in North America. It features a rosette of grass-like leaves and produces a dense, fragrant spike of greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It blooms in late summer and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
