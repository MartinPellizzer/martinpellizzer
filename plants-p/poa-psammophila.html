                    <h1>Poa psammophila</h1>
<p>Poa psammophila, commonly known as the sand bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration due to a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Poa psammophila plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
