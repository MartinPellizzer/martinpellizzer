<p>Polystichum alfaroi, commonly known as the Alfaroi wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and rocky soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polystichum alfaroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
