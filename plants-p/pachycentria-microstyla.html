                    <h1>Pachycentria microstyla</h1>
<p>Pachycentria microstyla, commonly known as the small-styled starburst lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
