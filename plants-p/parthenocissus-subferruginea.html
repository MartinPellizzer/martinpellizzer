                    <h1>Parthenocissus subferruginea</h1>
<p>Parthenocissus subferruginea, commonly known as the rusty ivy, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its tendrils allow it to climb and spread along walls, fences, and trees.</p>
<p>The leaves change color in the fall, turning from green to shades of red and orange, adding ornamental value to the landscape.</p>
