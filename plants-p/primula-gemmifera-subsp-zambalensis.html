<p>Primula gemmifera subsp.</p>
<p>zambalensis, commonly known as the Zambales primrose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation via gemmae.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
