<p>Pearsonia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower pearsonia, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive single, showy flower that blooms in late spring. The plant has a compact, shrub-like structure with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Its flowers are typically pink or white and are pollinated by native bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pearsonia uniflora is considered endangered and is protected under New Zealand's conservation laws.</p>
