                    <h1>Poa sanchez-vegae</h1>
<p>Poa sanchez-vegae, commonly known as the SÃ¡nchez-Vega bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to maritime climates, tolerating salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescences produce light yellow to brown flowers, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Poa sanchez-vegae is often found in dune ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion.</p>
