<p>Phlegmariurus talamauanus, commonly known as the Talamauan clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces sporophytes with microspores and megaspores, which are released from specialized structures called strobila. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among clubmosses.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus talamauanus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
