                    <h1>Prosaptia fuscopilosa</h1>
<p>Prosaptia fuscopilosa, commonly known as the black-spined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prosaptia fuscopilosa is considered a conservation concern.</p>
