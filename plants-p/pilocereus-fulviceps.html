<p>Pilocereus fulviceps, commonly known as the white-flowered night bloomer, is a cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically consumed raw or used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its nocturnal blooming habit is an adaptation to avoid daytime heat and attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
