<p>Poa brownei, commonly known as the Brown's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. The plant has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Poa brownei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult habitats.</p>
