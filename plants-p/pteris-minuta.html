<p>Pteris minuta, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that form a dense carpet on the forest floor. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize shaded environments. Its fronds are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, giving it a lush, moss-like appearance.</p>
<p>Pteris minuta thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in shaded, humid habitats.</p>
