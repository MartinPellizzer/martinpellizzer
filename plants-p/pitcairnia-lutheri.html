                    <h1>Pitcairnia lutheri</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia lutheri, commonly known as the Luther's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, a feature typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that surround its small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia lutheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
