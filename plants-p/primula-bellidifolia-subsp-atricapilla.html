<p>Primula bellidifolia subsp.</p>
<p>atricapilla, commonly known as the black-capped primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often with a distinctive dark purple or black cap on the flower throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
