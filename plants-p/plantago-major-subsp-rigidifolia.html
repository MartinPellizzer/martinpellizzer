<p>Plantago major subsp.</p>
<p>rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>

<p>This subspecies is characterized by its stiff, upright leaves, distinguishing it from other members of the Plantago genus.</p>
