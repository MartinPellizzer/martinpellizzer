<p>Pachymitra rufa, commonly known as the red-leaved pachymitra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often reddish in color, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
