<p>Pleroma noblickii, commonly known as the noble pleroma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that mature to a dark purple color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleroma noblickii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
