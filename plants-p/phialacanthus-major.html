                    <h1>Phialacanthus major</h1>
<p>Phialacanthus major, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of still water. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant and supports the heavy leaves. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom at night and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Phialacanthus major plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
