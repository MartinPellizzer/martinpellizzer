<p>Pinus sylvestris var. tartarica, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to northern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard Scots pine.
