                    <h1>Prunus glandulosa var. purdomii</h1>
<p>Prunus glandulosa var. purdomii, commonly known as the Purdom's cherry, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence on both the leaves and stems, which gives it a unique appearance and helps in water conservation. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, sweet-tart berries that are edible. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
