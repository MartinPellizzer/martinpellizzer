<p>Paronychia echinata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthorn, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh climates.</p>
