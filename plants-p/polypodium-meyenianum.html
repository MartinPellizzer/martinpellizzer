<p>Polypodium meyenianum, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, shield-shaped appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium.

<p>Polypodium meyenianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
