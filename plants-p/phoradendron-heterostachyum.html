                    <h1>Phoradendron heterostachyum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron heterostachyum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to colonize new hosts.</p>
<p>The botanical structure of Phoradendron heterostachyum includes a root system that penetrates the host's bark to establish a connection for nutrient uptake.</p>
