<p>Polylepis rodolfo-vasquezii, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a rare and endangered species native to the cloud forests of the Andes in Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its high-altitude, arid environment. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has a distinctive trunk with a rough, fissured bark. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various endemic species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
