<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pterygiella duclouxii is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
