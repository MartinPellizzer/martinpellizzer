<p>Piper stamineum var. longifolium, commonly known as long-leaved black pepper, is a variant of the pepper plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often larger than those of the standard black pepper plant. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a dark red or black color, similar to the fruit of Piper nigrum. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
