                    <h1>Phoradendron stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for certain birds and insects, which in turn help disperse its seeds.</p>
