                    <h1>Pogonia parviflora</h1>
<p>Pogonia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and bog habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a slender, rhizomatous root system and produces a single, erect stem with a few narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant's most distinctive feature is its showy, pinkish-purple flowers with intricate patterns resembling eyes or faces. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
