<p>Pitcairnia lorentziana, commonly known as the Lorentziana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water, a feature common among many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
