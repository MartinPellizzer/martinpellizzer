<p>Pinguicula crystallina subsp.</p>
<p>hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, glandular-stemmed leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects.</p>

<p>Its botanical features make it a unique and fascinating subject for both horticultural and scientific study.</p>
