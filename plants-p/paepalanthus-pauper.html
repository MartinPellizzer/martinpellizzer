<p>Paepalanthus pauper, commonly known as the poor man's cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a globular or cylindrical stem that is covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
