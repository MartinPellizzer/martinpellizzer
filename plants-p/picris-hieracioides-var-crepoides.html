                    <h1>Picris hieracioides var. crepoides</h1>
<p>Picris hieracioides var. crepoides, commonly known as the creeping sowthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with pale green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
