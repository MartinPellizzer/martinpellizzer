                    <h1>Pinanga ligulata</h1>
<p>Pinanga ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pteridium, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its slender, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, circular structures called sori. Pinanga ligulata thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of tropical understory ecosystems.</p>
