                    <h1>Pharnaceum hirtum</h1>
<p>Pharnaceum hirtum, commonly known as the hairy pharnaceum, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. Pharnaceum hirtum is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its hairy texture, as suggested by its name, helps reduce water loss and provides some protection against herbivores.</p>
