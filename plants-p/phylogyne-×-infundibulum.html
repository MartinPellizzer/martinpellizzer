                    <h1>Phylogyne × infundibulum</h1>
<p>Phylogyne × infundibulum, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a cross between two orchid species, typically Phalaenopsis and Vanda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that often have a unique combination of colors and patterns. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in segments rather than from a single point. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, typical of epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>The botanical name reflects its hybrid origin, with "×" indicating a cross between different species.</p>
