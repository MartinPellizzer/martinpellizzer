<p>Pleroma cryptadenum, commonly known as the hidden bellflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, Pleroma cryptadenum is considered a threatened species.</p>
