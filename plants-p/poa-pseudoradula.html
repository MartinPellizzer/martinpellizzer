                    <h1>Poa pseudoradula</h1>
<p>Poa pseudoradula, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically concealed within dense foliage. Poa pseudoradula is adapted to cold, windy environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
