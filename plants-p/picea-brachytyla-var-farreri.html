                    <h1>Picea brachytyla var. farreri</h1>
<p>Picea brachytyla var. farreri, commonly known as the Farrer's spruce, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pyramidal shape and dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking silver-blue in winter. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It is well-suited for cultivation in cool, moist climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
