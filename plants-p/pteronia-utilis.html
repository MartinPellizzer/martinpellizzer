<p>Pteronia utilis, commonly known as the silver cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, silver-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
