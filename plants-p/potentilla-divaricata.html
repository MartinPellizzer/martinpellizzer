                    <h1>Potentilla divaricata</h1>
<p>Potentilla divaricata, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Potentilla divaricata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded environments.</p>
