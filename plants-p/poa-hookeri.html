<p>Poa hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, silver-green appearance.</p>
<p>Poa hookeri plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover plant.</p>
