                    <h1>Phoradendron molinae</h1>
<p>Phoradendron molinae, commonly known as the Mexican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Phoradendron molinae plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife.</p>
