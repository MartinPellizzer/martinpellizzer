<p>Portulaca opposita, commonly known as purslane, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is a low-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Purslane is also known for its edible leaves and seeds, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and nutrients.</p>
