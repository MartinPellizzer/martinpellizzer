<p>Prasium majus var. minus, commonly known as the lesser giant fern, is a variant of the giant fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
