                    <h1>Perdicium nervosum</h1>
<p>Perdicium nervosum, commonly known as the veined lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive network of veins that run through its thallus, giving it a unique appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
