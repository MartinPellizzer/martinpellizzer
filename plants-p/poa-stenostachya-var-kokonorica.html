                    <h1>Poa stenostachya var. kokonorica</h1>
<p>Poa stenostachya var. kokonorica, commonly known as the Tibetan meadowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
