<p>Polygonum adpressum, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Polygonum adpressum is often found in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors.</p>
