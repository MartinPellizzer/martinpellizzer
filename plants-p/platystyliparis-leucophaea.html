                    <h1>Platystyliparis leucophaea</h1>
<p>Platystyliparis leucophaea, commonly known as the white-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is subject to conservation efforts.</p>
