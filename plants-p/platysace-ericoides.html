                <h1>Platysace ericoides</h1>
<p>Platysace ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions.</p>
