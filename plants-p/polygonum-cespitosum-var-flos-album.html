                    <h1>Polygonum cespitosum var. flos-album</h1>
<p>Polygonum cespitosum var. flos-album, commonly known as white knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a useful plant for erosion control and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
