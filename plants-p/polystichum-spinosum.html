                    <h1>Polystichum spinosum</h1>
<p>Polystichum spinosum, commonly known as the spinous wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments with serrated edges, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>The plant's distinctive spiny appearance gives it its common name and makes it easily recognizable in its natural habitat.</p>
