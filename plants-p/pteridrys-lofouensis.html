                    <h1>Pteridrys lofouensis</h1>
<p>Pteridrys lofouensis, commonly known as the Lofouense fern, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that help it spread along the forest floor. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the leaves, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteridrys lofouensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
