<p>Podocarpus neriifolius subsp.</p>
<p>penibukanensis, commonly known as the Penibukan podocarp, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, cone-like structures that mature into woody cones.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is typically found in cool, moist, shaded environments within montane forests. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinct, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
