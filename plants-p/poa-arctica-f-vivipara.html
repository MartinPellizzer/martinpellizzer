                    <h1>Poa arctica f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa arctica f. vivipara, commonly known as the Arctic stoloniferous grass, is a variant of the Arctic grass species Poa arctica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which are capable of rooting and growing into new plants while still attached to the parent plant. This adaptation allows it to thrive in harsh, cold environments such as tundra and alpine regions. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a low-growing vegetation cover.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
