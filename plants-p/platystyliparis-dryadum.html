<p>Platystyliparis dryadum, commonly known as the dryad's flame, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystyliparis dryadum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
