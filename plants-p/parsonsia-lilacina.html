                    <h1>Parsonsia lilacina</h1>
<p>Parsonsia lilacina, commonly known as the lilac nightshade, is a striking tropical shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant violet to lilac-colored flowers, which are typically clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. The plant features woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly moths, due to their night-opening nature.</p>
<p>Parsonsia lilacina is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display.</p>
