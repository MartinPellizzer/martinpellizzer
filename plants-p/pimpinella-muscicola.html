                    <h1>Pimpinella muscicola</h1>
<p>Pimpinella muscicola, commonly known as the mossy parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are finely divided, with a fern-like appearance, and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Its small white flowers appear in spring, followed by small, dry fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
