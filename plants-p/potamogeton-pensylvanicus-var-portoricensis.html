                    <h1>Potamogeton pensylvanicus var. portoricensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton pensylvanicus var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. This variety is adapted to slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and lakes, where it can form dense underwater vegetation. It plays an important role in providing habitat and food for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
