<p>Panicum squarrosum, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a native grass species found in various parts of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among grasses. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, bristly hairs, contributing to its rough texture.</p>
<p>Panicum squarrosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
