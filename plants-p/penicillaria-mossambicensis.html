<p>Penicillaria mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique penicillaria, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky or sandy habitats, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth structure, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are typically short and strongly dimorphic, with distinct differences between the dorsal and ventral surfaces.</p>
<p>This moss is often found in southern Africa, including countries like Mozambique, South Africa, and Namibia.</p>
