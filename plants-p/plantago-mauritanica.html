                    <h1>Plantago mauritanica</h1>
<p>Plantago mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritanian plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It has a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a dense spike, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low moisture.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and healing properties.</p>
