                    <h1>Phoradendron tepuianum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tepuianum, commonly known as the tepui mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its green stems for photosynthesis. The plant attaches to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Protium, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are often clustered and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that disperses its sticky seeds, which can adhere to the feathers of birds or the fur of animals.</p>
