                    <h1>Pteris quadriaurita var. setigera</h1>
<p>Pteris quadriaurita var. setigera, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a variant of the common water fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, hairy texture on the underside, contributing to its common name. It produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
