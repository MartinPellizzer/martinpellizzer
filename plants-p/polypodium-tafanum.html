<p>Polypodium tafanum, commonly known as the Tafanu fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Polypodium tafanum plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
