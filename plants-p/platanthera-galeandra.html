                    <h1>Platanthera galeandra</h1>
<p>Platanthera galeandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America, particularly found in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many regions.</p>
