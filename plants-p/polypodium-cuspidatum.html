<p>Polypodium cuspidatum, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, forked segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
