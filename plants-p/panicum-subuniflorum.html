                    <h1>Panicum subuniflorum</h1>
<p>Panicum subuniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower panicgrass, is a species of grass native to parts of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing a single floret, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species.</p>
