                    <h1>Pontederia mucronata</h1>
<p>Pontederia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterhyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often with three sepals and three petals. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
