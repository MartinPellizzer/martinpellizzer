                    <h1>Phaseolus schottii f. transiens</h1>
<p>Phaseolus schottii f. transiens, commonly known as the creeping pole bean, is a wild legume native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its wild nature, it is less cultivated than other Phaseolus species but holds potential for genetic diversity in breeding programs.</p>
