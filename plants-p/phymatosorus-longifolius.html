<p>Phymatosorus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaf cliff brake, is a fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, and serrated fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing rocky habitats.</p>
