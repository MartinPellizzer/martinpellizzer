                    <h1>Phoradendron clavatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron clavatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, and it has a unique ability to photosynthesize, though it relies on its host for essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Phoradendron clavatum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
