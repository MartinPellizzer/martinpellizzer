                    <h1>Pinus muricata var. anthonyi</h1>
<p>Pinus muricata var. anthonyi, commonly known as the Anthony's knobcone pine, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the knobcone pine native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, resinous foliage and cone-like structures that are typically closed at the base, making seed dispersal unique compared to other pine species. The tree has a slow growth rate and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils, often found in high-elevation environments. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for various endemic species and its contribution to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
