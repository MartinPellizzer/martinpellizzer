                    <h1>Polypodium nutatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium nutatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium nutatum is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant.</p>
