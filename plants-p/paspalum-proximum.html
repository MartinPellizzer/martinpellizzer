                    <h1>Paspalum proximum</h1>
<p>Paspalum proximum, commonly known as slender paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Paspalum proximum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
