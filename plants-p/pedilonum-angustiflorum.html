                    <h1>Pedilonum angustiflorum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum angustiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flower pedilonum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a short growing season and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in high-altitude environments with limited nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Pedilonum angustiflorum is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
