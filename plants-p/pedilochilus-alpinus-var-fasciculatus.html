                    <h1>Pedilochilus alpinus var. fasciculatus</h1>
<p>Pedilochilus alpinus var. fasciculatus, commonly known as the Alpine pedilochilus, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, hairy growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered in fascicles, giving it its varietal name. The flowers are typically pale green to white with a distinctive, spurred lip, and they bloom during the cooler months. This variety thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
