                    <h1>Pleopeltis sordida</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis sordida, commonly known as the sordid pleopeltis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, giving it a somewhat dull appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and short, anchoring it to substrates like soil or stone.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
