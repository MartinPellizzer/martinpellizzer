                    <h1>Pleurostelma schimperi</h1>
<p>Pleurostelma schimperi, commonly known as the Schimperi's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water absorption and protection from strong sunlight.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation allows it to survive in its natural habitat without soil.</p>
