                    <h1>Placus laciniatus</h1>
<p>Placus laciniatus, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects. The plant's leaves are thin and often divided, with delicate, fringed edges that aid in capturing prey. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters, where it can float or anchor itself to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
