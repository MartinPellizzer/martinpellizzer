<p>Pachylophus exiguus, commonly known as the small-scale lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure with a leathery texture and a dark green to brownish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its growth is slow, and it often colonizes rocks, trees, and soil surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
