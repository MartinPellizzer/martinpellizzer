<p>Petalocentrum pusillum, commonly known as the small petal fern, is a delicate and rare fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Petalocentrum pusillum thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
