<p>Pinguicula leptoceras subsp.</p>
<p>corsica, commonly known as the Corsican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, emerging from the center of the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptations to nutrient-poor habitats and its unique method of obtaining nutrients through insect capture.</p>
