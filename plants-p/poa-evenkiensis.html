                    <h1>Poa evenkiensis</h1>
<p>Poa evenkiensis, commonly known as the Evenki grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subarctic environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates makes it an important component of high-altitude and tundra ecosystems.</p>
<p>Poa evenkiensis is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife.</p>
