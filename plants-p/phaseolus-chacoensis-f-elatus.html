                    <h1>Phaseolus chacoensis f. elatus</h1>
<p>Phaseolus chacoensis f. elatus, commonly known as the Chaco climbing bean, is a rare and lesser-known variety of the Phaseolus genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the dry regions of South America, particularly in Paraguay and northern Argentina. This plant is characterized by its twining habit and small, elongated pods that contain edible seeds. Its botanical features include compound leaves with trifoliate structures and pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable but underutilized crop in agricultural research.</p>
