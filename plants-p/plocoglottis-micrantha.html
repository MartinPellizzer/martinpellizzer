                    <h1>Plocoglottis micrantha</h1>
<p>Plocoglottis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered plocoglottis, is a herbaceous plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
