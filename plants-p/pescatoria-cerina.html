                    <h1>Pescatoria cerina</h1>
<p>Pescatoria cerina, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like inflorescence and vibrant yellow and orange petals that resemble the coloration of a spider. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing near the edges of dunes or in open grasslands. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Pescatoria cerina is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
