<p>Psammogeton capillifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Psammogeton capillifolium is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system.</p>
