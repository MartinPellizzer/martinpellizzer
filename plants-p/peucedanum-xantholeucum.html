<p>Peucedanum xantholeucum, commonly known as the yellow-leaved cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a ribbed, dry fruit and are often dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
