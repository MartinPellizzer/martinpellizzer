                    <h1>Polygala monspeliaca subvar. ramosa</h1>
<p>Polygala monspeliaca subvar. ramosa, commonly known as the ramose milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered an important component of xerophilous ecosystems.</p>
