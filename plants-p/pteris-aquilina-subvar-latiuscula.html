                    <h1>Pteris aquilina subvar. latiuscula</h1>
<p>Pteris aquilina subvar. latiuscula, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a variant of the common water fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. The plant features large, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, almost triangular shape. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
