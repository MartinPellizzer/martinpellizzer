<p>Phymatopteris simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Phymatopteris simplicifolia plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
