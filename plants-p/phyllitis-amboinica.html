<p>Phyllitis amboinica, commonly known as the Amboina water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are slender and help in nutrient absorption, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Phyllitis amboinica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
