                    <h1>Pitcairnia dolichopetala</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia dolichopetala, commonly known as the long-petaled pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated, violet-blue bracts that enclose the inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help retain moisture.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are usually small and white or pale pink, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects and birds.</p>
