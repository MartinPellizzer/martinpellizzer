                    <h1>Polystichum spinulosum</h1>
<p>Polystichum spinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with fine, spinulose (spiny) structures along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing sorus is located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
