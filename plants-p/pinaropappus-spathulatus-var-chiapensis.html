                    <h1>Pinaropappus spathulatus var. chiapensis</h1>
<p>Pinaropappus spathulatus var. chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas flatleaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in many cacti for reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
