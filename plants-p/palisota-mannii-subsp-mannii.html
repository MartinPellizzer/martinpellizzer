<p>Palisota mannii subsp.</p>
<p>mannii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
