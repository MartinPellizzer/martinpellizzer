                    <h1>Polystichum acrostichoides var. schweinitzii</h1>
<p>Polystichum acrostichoides var. schweinitzii, commonly known as Schweinitz's shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arched or recurved. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The varietal form, schweinitzii, is distinguished by its more compact growth and distinctive frond morphology compared to the typical form.</p>
