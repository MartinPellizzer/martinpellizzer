                    <h1>Pariana multiflora</h1>
<p>Pariana multiflora, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are succulent and often have a bladders-like appearance, which helps it retain water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Pariana multiflora is adapted to salt spray and is an important part of the coastal flora in its native habitat.</p>
