                    <h1>Polypodium cumingianum</h1>
<p>Polypodium cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
