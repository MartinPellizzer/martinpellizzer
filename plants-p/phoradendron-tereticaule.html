                    <h1>Phoradendron tereticaule</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tereticaule, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to obtain additional energy. Its berries are typically red or orange and are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Phoradendron tereticaule plays a role in ecological interactions, including seed dispersal and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
