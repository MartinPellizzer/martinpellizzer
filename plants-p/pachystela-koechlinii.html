                    <h1>Pachystela koechlinii</h1>
<p>Pachystela koechlinii, commonly known as the Koechlin's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the wet tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pachystela koechlinii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
