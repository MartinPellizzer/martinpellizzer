                            <h1>Pentacalia Caliana</h1>
<p>Pentacalia caliana is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family known for its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers. Native to the island of Socotra, this plant thrives in arid and rocky environments where few others can survive. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike. The plant's survival is threatened by habitat loss and climate change, prompting urgent efforts to protect it. Studying Pentacalia caliana offers valuable insights into adaptive evolution and biodiversity in extreme ecosystems.</p>
