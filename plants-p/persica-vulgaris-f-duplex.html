                    <h1>Persica vulgaris f. duplex</h1>
<p>Persica vulgaris f. duplex, commonly known as the double-flowered peach.</p>
<p>This variant is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two rows of petals instead of the typical single row. The double flowers are a result of a genetic mutation that enhances the floral display, making it a popular ornamental plant. It retains the basic botanical features of the peach, including its fruit-bearing capability and similar growth habits.</p>
<p>However, the double-flowered form is often grown for its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production.</p>
