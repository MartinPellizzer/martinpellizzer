                    <h1>Poikilacanthus humilis</h1>
<p>Poikilacanthus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf star cactus, is a low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, sprawling structure with multiple stems that branch out from a central base. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Poikilacanthus humilis is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
