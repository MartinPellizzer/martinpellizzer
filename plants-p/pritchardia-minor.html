                    <h1>Pritchardia minor</h1>
<p>Pritchardia minor, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pritchardia minor is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
