                    <h1>Phelipanche septemloba</h1>
<p>Phelipanche septemloba, commonly known as the seven-lobed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and has a taproot system that allows it to attach to host roots. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like legumes and vegetables.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with host roots through haustoria.</p>
