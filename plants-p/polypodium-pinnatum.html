                    <h1>Polypodium pinnatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium pinnatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded forest floors, preferring moist and humid environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
