<p>Phymatodes scandens, commonly known as the creeping phymatode, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
