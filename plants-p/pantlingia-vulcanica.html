                    <h1>Pantlingia vulcanica</h1>
<p>Pantlingia vulcanica, commonly known as the fireroot plant, is a rare and resilient species native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, high-temperature environments, often found near active or dormant volcanoes. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in arid conditions. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in unstable, rocky soil.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Apiaceae, sharing some characteristics with carrots and parsley.</p>
