<p>Polysphaeria acuminata, commonly known as the spike moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lepidosporales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a distinct sporophyte structure that consists of a stem with whorls of spore-bearing leaves. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Polysphaeria acuminata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
