<p>Polypodium disjunctum, commonly known as the scattered cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often growing on cliffs or in shaded, moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium disjunctum is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in its natural habitat.</p>
