<p>Phegopteris elata, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms.</p>
