                    <h1>Paspalum xizangense</h1>
<p>Paspalum xizangense, commonly known as the Tibetan paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and neighboring areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Paspalum xizangense is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in alpine environments.</p>
