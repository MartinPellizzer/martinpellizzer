<p>Pritchardia elliptica, commonly known as the Tahitian papaia, is a species of cycad native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cone-like structure, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
