<p>Panicum megalanthum, commonly known as giant panicgrass, is a tall, robust grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces large, feathery panicles of small, white to reddish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its height and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
