<p>Pterocaulon spicatum var. cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical pterocaulon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
