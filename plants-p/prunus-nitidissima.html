                    <h1>Prunus nitidissima</h1>
<p>Prunus nitidissima, commonly known as the glossy blight cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark red bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, nearly spherical fruits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a problematic weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
