<p>Panctenis pedicularia, commonly known as the common bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Panctenis pedicularia is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
