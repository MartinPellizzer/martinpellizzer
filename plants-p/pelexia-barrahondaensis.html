<p>Pelexia barrahondaensis, commonly known as the Barrahonda's pelexia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelexia barrahondaensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
