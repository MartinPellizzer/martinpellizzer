                    <h1>Potentilla verna var. vuachensis</h1>
<p>Potentilla verna var. vuachensis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
