                    <h1>Phoradendron tomentosum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tomentosum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its presence can affect the health of host trees, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even mortality.</p>
