<p>Padus avium subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the northern bird cherry, is a subspecies of the bird cherry tree native to northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red drupes that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The subspecies is adapted to cooler climates and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
