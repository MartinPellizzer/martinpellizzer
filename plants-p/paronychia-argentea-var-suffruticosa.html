                    <h1>Paronychia argentea var. suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Paronychia argentea var. suffruticosa, commonly known as silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features silvery-white, woolly foliage that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or desert regions.</p>
