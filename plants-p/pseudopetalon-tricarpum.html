                    <h1>Pseudopetalon tricarpum</h1>
<p>Pseudopetalon tricarpum, commonly known as the three-fruit pseudopetalon, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with five花瓣-like structures that are not fully fused. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release three seeds, giving the species its scientific name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
