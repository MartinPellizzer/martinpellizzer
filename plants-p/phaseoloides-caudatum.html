                    <h1>Phaseoloides caudatum</h1>
<p>Phaseoloides caudatum, commonly known as the hairy pod vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits. Its seeds are typically enclosed within these pods and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
