<p>Phyllodes arrabidae, commonly known as the Arrabida tree, is a species of acacia native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often reduced to phyllodesâ€”flat, narrow, leaf-like structures that perform the function of photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The phyllodes are also used in traditional medicine by local communities for their potential therapeutic properties.</p>
