                    <h1>Polygonum rigidum</h1>
<p>Polygonum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, somewhat woody stems that become rigid with age, and its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Polygonum rigidum is often noted for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a plant of ecological interest.</p>
