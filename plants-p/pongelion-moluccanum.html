<p>Pongelion moluccanum, commonly known as the Moluccan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that often display a range of colors from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its small, strap-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single inflorescence with several showy blooms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
