<p>Polystichum prolificans, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
