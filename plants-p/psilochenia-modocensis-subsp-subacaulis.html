<p>Psilochenia modocensis subsp.</p>
<p>subacaulis, commonly known as the Modoc Valley spikerush, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Modoc Plateau in California. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in wetland and riparian habitats, often found in areas with seasonal flooding. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, including a robust root system for anchoring in saturated soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
