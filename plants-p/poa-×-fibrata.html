                    <h1>Poa × fibrata</h1>
<p>Poa × fibrata, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted grass blades and a dark green color, often forming dense, compact turf. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in lawns and golf courses. It is not typically used for forage due to its lack of seed production and limited growth habit.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in grasses.</p>
