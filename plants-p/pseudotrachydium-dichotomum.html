<p>Pseudotrachydium dichotomum, commonly known as the forked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on its specialized bladders for nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>Pseudotrachydium dichotomum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality.</p>
