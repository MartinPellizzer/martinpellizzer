<p>Piptochaetium verruculosum, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its flowers are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to harsh environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Piptochaetium verruculosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide forage for livestock.</p>
