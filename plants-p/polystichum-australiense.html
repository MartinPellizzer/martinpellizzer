                    <h1>Polystichum australiense</h1>
<p>Polystichum australiense, commonly known as the Australian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
