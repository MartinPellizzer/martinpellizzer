                    <h1>Phoradendron riberense</h1>
<p>Phoradendron riberense, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its sticky seeds adhere to the bark of host trees, allowing the plant to establish itself.</p>
<p>Phoradendron riberense plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
