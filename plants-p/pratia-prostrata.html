<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
