                    <h1>Psilotrichum albipilosum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum albipilosum, commonly known as the white-hair fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant lacks true roots, leaves, and flowers, and instead has specialized structures called sporangia for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
