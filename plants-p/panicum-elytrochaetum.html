                    <h1>Panicum elytrochaetum</h1>
<p>Panicum elytrochaetum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and hairy leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural fields and natural ecosystems.</p>
