                <h1>Phegopteris elmeri</h1>
<p>Phegopteris elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's water fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Phegopteris elmeri plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small invertebrates.</p>
