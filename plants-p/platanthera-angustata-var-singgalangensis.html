                    <h1>Platanthera angustata var. singgalangensis</h1>
<p>Platanthera angustata var. singgalangensis, commonly known as the Singgalang narrow-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded forest understories, often on decaying wood or in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It has a complex mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
