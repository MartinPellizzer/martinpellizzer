                    <h1>Polygonum × ambiguum</h1>
<p>Polygonum × ambiguum, commonly known as the hybrid knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense stands. The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purplish tinge, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
