<p>Panicum scabrum subsp.</p>
<p>burgu, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to greenish flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife.</p>
