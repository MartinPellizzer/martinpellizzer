                    <h1>Pelagatia bracteata</h1>
<p>Pelagatia bracteata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. The plant has a compact growth habit with a rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that rise above them. Its bracts are modified leaves that surround the flower heads, providing structural support and protection.</p>
<p>Pelagatia bracteata is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh maritime conditions.</p>
