                    <h1>Poa spontanea</h1>
<p>Poa spontanea, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Poa spontanea is valued for its fine texture and is commonly used in turfgrass and ornamental landscaping.</p>
