                    <h1>Perrieriella</h1>
<p>Perrieriella, commonly known as the mountain holly or *Perrieriella perrieri*, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes shrubs and evergreen plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to cold, arid environments, with thick cuticles and compact growth forms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perrieriella is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
