                    <h1>Phaeopappus cichoriifolius</h1>
<p>Phaeopappus cichoriifolius, commonly known as the purple pappus lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by small, hairy, purple pappus structures that aid in wind pollination. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
