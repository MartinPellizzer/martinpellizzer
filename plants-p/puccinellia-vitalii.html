<p>Puccinellia vitalii, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Puccinellia vitalii is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals.</p>
