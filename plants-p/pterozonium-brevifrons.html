                    <h1>Pterozonium brevifrons</h1>
<p>Pterozonium brevifrons, commonly known as the narrow-headed pterozonium, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pterozoniaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and distinctive, narrow floral structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly substrates at high elevations, where it faces harsh climatic conditions. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pterozonium brevifrons is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability.</p>
