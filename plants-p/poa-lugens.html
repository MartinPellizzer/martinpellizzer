                    <h1>Poa lugens</h1>
<p>Poa lugens, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Poa lugens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats.</p>
