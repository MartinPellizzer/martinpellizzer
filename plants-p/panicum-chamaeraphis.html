<p>Panicum chamaeraphis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and salt-tolerant nature, making it well-suited for saline environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, bluish-green, and covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which help in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Panicum chamaeraphis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
