<p>Pollinia dura, commonly known as the hard pollinia orchid, is a unique plant characterized by its specialized reproductive structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to certain regions of South America. The plant's most distinctive feature is its hard, dry pollinia, which are clustered together in a structure called a pollinarium. These pollinia are adapted for attachment to the bodies of pollinators, ensuring efficient pollination.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Pollinia dura make it an interesting subject for study in plant reproduction and adaptation.</p>
