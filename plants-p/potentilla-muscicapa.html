<p>Potentilla muscicapa, commonly known as the mossy cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptic, with finely toothed margins, and the stems are covered in a soft, moss-like coating.</p>
<p>Potentilla muscicapa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
