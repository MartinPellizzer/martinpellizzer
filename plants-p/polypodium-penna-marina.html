                    <h1>Polypodium penna-marina</h1>
<p>Polypodium penna-marina, commonly known as the sea holly, is a fern native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium penna-marina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions.</p>
