<p>Peristylus elbertii, commonly known as the Elbert's peristylus, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
