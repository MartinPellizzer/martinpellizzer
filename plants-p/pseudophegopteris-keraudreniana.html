                    <h1>Pseudophegopteris keraudreniana</h1>
<p>Pseudophegopteris keraudreniana, commonly known as the Keraudren's shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in dense forests or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
