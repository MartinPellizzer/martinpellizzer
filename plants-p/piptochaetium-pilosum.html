                    <h1>Piptochaetium pilosum</h1>
<p>Piptochaetium pilosum, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear颖果, a type of dry, indehiscent fruit. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Piptochaetium pilosum is an important component of grassland ecosystems and is used in some regions for livestock grazing.</p>
