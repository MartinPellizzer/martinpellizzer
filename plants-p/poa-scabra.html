<p>Poa scabra, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Poa scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover.</p>
