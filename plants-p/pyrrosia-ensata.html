<p>Pyrrosia ensata, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous regions. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, waxy coating that helps it retain moisture.
