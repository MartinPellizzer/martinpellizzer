                    <h1>Pseudocystopteris repens</h1>
<p>Pseudocystopteris repens, commonly known as the running fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are often covered in small, scale-like structures. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in moist woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its ability to propagate effectively in its habitat.</p>
