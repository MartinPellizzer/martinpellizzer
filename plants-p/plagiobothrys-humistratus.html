<p>Plagiobothrys humistratus, commonly known as the coastal bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in the salty, windy environment.</p>
<p>Plagiobothrys humistratus is an important part of the coastal ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing dune habitats.</p>
