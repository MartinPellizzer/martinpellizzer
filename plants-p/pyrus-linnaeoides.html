<p>Pyrus linnaeoides, commonly known as the Florida crabapple, is a small deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 6â€“15 feet and features smooth, gray bark with a distinctive flaky texture.

Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Pyrus linnaeoides is well adapted to wetland environments and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
