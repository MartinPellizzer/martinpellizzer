<p>Panicum graniticum, commonly known as granite grass, is a species of grass native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found on slopes and in disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains of pollen.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low water requirements, Panicum graniticum is often used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
