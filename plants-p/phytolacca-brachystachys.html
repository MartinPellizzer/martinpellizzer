                    <h1>Phytolacca brachystachys</h1>
<p>Phytolacca brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked pokeweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
