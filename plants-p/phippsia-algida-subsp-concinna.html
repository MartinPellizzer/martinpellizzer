<p>Phippsia algida subsp.</p>
<p>concinna, commonly known as the alpine phippsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, bell-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine tundra and rocky habitats. Its growth is typically low to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
