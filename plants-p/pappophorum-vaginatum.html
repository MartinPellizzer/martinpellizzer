                    <h1>Pappophorum vaginatum</h1>
<p>Pappophorum vaginatum, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that give it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, often colonizing disturbed soils and wetlands.</p>
<p>Pappophorum vaginatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments.</p>
