                    <h1>Pitcairnia encholirioides</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia encholirioides, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences bearing showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
