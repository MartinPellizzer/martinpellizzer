                    <h1>Phytosalpinx lucida</h1>
<p>Phytosalpinx lucida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stem for photosynthesis, making it highly adapted to its canopy habitat. Its flowers are typically visited by specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Phytosalpinx lucida is considered a conservation concern.</p>
