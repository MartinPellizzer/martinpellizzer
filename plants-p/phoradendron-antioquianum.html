                    <h1>Phoradendron antioquianum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron antioquianum, commonly known as the Antioquian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by berries that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also contributing to ecological interactions within forest ecosystems.</p>
