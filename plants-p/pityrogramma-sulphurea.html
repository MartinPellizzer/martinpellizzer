                    <h1>Pityrogramma sulphurea</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma sulphurea, commonly known as the golden water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
