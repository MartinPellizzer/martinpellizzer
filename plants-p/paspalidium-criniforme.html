                    <h1>Paspalidium criniforme</h1>
<p>Paspalidium criniforme, commonly known as the feathery grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, flowing appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, where it can thrive in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Paspalidium criniforme is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
