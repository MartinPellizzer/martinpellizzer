                    <h1>Pupalia lappacea var. argyrophylla</h1>
<p>Pupalia lappacea var. argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
