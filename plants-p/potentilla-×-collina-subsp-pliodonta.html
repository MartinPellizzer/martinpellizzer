<p>Potentilla × collina subsp.</p>
<p>pliodonta, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, rose-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its foliage is usually dark green and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
