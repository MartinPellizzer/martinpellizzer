<p>Piptochaetium avenaceum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
