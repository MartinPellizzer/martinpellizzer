<p>Polystichum hookerianum, commonly known as Hooker's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, narrow, and often arching fronds. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and thrives in shaded, rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum hookerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
