                    <h1>Poa paui</h1>
<p>Poa paui, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal environments, characterized by its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Poa paui plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>
