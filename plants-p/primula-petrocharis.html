<p>Primula petrocharis, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
