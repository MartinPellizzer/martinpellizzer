                    <h1>Polypodium tanacetifolium</h1>
<p>Polypodium tanacetifolium, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the common brake fern. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
