<p>Platycarpum negrense var. glaucum, commonly known as the Glaucous Cudweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late summer, producing small, yellowish disc flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray florets.</p>
