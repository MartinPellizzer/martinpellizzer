<p>Pleurothallis pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved slipper orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid but often dry environments.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in clusters and are highly attractive to pollinators.</p>
