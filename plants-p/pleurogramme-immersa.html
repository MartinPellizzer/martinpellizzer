                    <h1>Pleurogramme immersa</h1>
<p>Pleurogramme immersa, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its leaves floating on the surface while its roots anchor in the substrate. The plant has a distinctive rosette-like structure with broad, waxy leaves that help it float and absorb sunlight. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear above the water.</p>
<p>Pleurogramme immersa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water edges.</p>
