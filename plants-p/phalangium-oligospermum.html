                    <h1>Phalangium oligospermum</h1>
<p>Phalangium oligospermum, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Phalangium oligospermum is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited moisture.</p>
