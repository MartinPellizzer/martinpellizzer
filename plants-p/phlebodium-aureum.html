                    <h1>Phlebodium aureum</h1>
<p>Phlebodium aureum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, antler-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes form a dense, fibrous mat that anchors it to trees or other structures.</p>
<p>Phlebodium aureum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
