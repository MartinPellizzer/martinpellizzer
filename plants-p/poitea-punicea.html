                    <h1>Poitea punicea</h1>
<p>Poitea punicea, commonly known as the red-flowered poitea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Its vibrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Poitea punicea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
