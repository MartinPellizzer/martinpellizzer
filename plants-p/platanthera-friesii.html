<p>Platanthera friesii, commonly known as the Fries' spurge orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a delicate, slender stem and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
