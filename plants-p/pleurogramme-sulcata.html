<p>Pleurogramme sulcata, commonly known as the pleurogramme, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread across the substrate.</p>
