<p>Polypodium matthewii, commonly known as the Matthew's huperzia, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in subtropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
