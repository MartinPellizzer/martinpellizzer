<p>Polystichum paramartini, commonly known as the Paramartini sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>
