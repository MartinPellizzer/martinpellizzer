<p>Paspalum atratum, commonly known as blackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, often bluish-gray foliage and produces dense, tufted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense monocultures.</p>
<p>Paspalum atratum is often considered a weed in agricultural and aquatic settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
