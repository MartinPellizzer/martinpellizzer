                    <h1>Poranthera ericoides</h1>
<p>Poranthera ericoides, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly along coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Poranthera ericoides plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
