                    <h1>Psamma littoralis var. australis</h1>
<p>Psamma littoralis var. australis, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline and sandy coastal environments.</p>
<p>It possesses a compact, low-growing structure with succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is native to southern coastal regions of Australia and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
