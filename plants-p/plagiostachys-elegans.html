<p>Plagiostachys elegans, commonly known as the golden bamboo or yellow bamboo, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, golden-yellow culms that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rapid growth rate and clumping habit make it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
