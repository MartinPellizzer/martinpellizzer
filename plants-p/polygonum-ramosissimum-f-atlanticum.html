<p>Polygonum ramosissimum f. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, reddish stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or red, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense colonies in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in dunes, marshes, and along the edges of tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
