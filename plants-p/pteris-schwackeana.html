                    <h1>Pteris schwackeana</h1>
<p>Pteris schwackeana, commonly known as the Schwacke's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
