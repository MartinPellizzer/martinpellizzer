                    <h1>Poa trivialis var. obtusata</h1>
<p>Poa trivialis var. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaf bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like turf. The leaves are shorter and broader than those of the typical Poa trivialis, with a blunt tip, giving it its specific epithet. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
