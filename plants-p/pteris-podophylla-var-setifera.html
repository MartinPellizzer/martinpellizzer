<p>Pteris podophylla var. setifera, commonly known as the slender-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help anchor it in wet soils or water. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions.</p>
