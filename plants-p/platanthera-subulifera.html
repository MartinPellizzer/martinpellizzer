                    <h1>Platanthera subulifera</h1>
<p>Platanthera subulifera, commonly known as the slender-leaf twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
