<p>Polypodium dolichopterum, commonly known as the long-creeping polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Polypodium dolichopterum is primarily epiphytic, growing on tree trunks or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
