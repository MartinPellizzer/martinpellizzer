<p>Primula scopulorum, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and crevices, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Primula scopulorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing rocky habitats.</p>
