<p>Pongamia reflexa, commonly known as the Indian beech, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing oily seeds. These seeds are rich in oil and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it useful for reforestation efforts.</p>
