<p>Pyrethrum transiliense, commonly known as the Transilvanian pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian region of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain pyrethrinsâ€”natural insecticides. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in open woodland or grassy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in pest control, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
