                    <h1>Pinus strobus f. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Pinus strobus f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaf white pine, is a natural variant of the eastern white pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter, more compact needles compared to the typical white pine. The foliage is dense, with needles that are typically 2 to 4 inches long, giving the tree a more rounded appearance. It produces cones that are smaller and more conical than those of the standard species.</p>
<p>This form is often found in specific ecological niches, such as rocky or dry soils, where it exhibits greater hardiness.</p>
