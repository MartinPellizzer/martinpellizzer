<p>Pueraria phaseoloides var. subspicata, commonly known as the creeping cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical, yellowish pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
