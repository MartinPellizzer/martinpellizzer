                    <h1>Plantago coronopus</h1>
<p>Plantago coronopus, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, helmet-shaped capsule, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Plantago coronopus is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments.</p>
