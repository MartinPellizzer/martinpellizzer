                    <h1>Phragmites australis var. stenophyllus</h1>
<p>Phragmites australis var. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaf common reed, is a variant of the common reed found in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, dense stands that often grow in shallow water or moist soil. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. It is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals and other pollutants from the environment.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive colonies.</p>
