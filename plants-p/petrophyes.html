<p>Petrophyes, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that come in a range of colors including red, yellow, and white. These plants are typically found in arid or rocky environments, where they have adapted to survive with minimal water.
