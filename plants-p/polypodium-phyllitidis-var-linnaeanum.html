                    <h1>Polypodium phyllitidis var. linnaeanum</h1>
<p>Polypodium phyllitidis var. linnaeanum, commonly known as the Linnaean fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed polypody.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its historical significance in botanical classification, named in honor of Carl Linnaeus.</p>
