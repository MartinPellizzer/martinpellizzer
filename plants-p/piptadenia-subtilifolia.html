                    <h1>Piptadenia subtilifolia</h1>
<p>Piptadenia subtilifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical legume native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, fragrant yellow flowers that attract pollinators. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
