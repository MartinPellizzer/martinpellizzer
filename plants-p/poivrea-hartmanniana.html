<p>Poivrea hartmanniana, commonly known as Hartmann's wintergreen, is a species of flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique blooming period, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
