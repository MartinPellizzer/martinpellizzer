                            <h1>Podophyllum Hexandrum Var. Axillare</h1>
<p>Axillary podophyllum, scientifically known as Podophyllum hexandrum var. axillare, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This variant of the common podophyllum is distinguished by its unique growth pattern, with foliage emerging from the leaf axils rather than at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters. The plant's medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest for researchers and traditional healers alike. Despite its ecological and therapeutic significance, it remains under threat due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
