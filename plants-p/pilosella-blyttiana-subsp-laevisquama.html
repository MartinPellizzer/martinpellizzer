<p>Pilosella blyttiana subsp.</p>
<p>laevisquama, commonly known as the smooth-squamate pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are covered in fine, soft trichomes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are generally smooth and lack the pronounced scales found in other subspecies of Pilosella.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water retention mechanisms.</p>
