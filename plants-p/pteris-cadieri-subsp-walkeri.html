<p>Pteris cadieri subsp.</p>
<p>walkeri, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique rhizome system that allows it to "walk" across surfaces. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant features feather-like fronds with a distinctive, undulating appearance. Its sporangia are arranged in clusters along the margins of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
