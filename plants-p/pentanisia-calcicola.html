                    <h1>Pentanisia calcicola</h1>
<p>Pentanisia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in calcareous environments.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, which means it is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This species is often found on rocks, soil, or tree bark in arid or semi-arid regions. Its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions makes it an important indicator species for certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant's structure is simple, consisting of a thallus that can be crust-like or foliose in form.</p>
