                    <h1>Puccinellia byrrangensis</h1>
<p>Puccinellia byrrangensis, commonly known as the Byrrang grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to survive in saline and drought-prone environments, making it an important component of stabilized dunes and degraded soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
