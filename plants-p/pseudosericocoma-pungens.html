<p>Pseudosericocoma pungens, commonly known as the spiny lichen, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is usually covered with small, rounded lobes and is often a pale green or yellowish color.

<p>This lichen is typically found on rocks and soil in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
