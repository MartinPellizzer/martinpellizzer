<p>Pouteria arbuscula, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit, known as a "brazil nut," contains up to 20 seeds surrounded by a hard, fibrous shell.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in the rainforest, providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
