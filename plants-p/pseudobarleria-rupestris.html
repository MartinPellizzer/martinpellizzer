                    <h1>Pseudobarleria rupestris</h1>
<p>Pseudobarleria rupestris, commonly known as the rock barleria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Pseudobarleria rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
