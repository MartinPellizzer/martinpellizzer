<p>Platycarya strobilacea var. kawakamii, commonly known as the Kawakami's box-leaf chinquapin, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hippocastanaceae and is characterized by its unique, clustered, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, woody cones that mature to reveal edible nuts, which are encased in a hard shell. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
