<p>Polypodium oppositifolium, commonly known as the opposite-leaf polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically arranged in a bipinnate structure. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
