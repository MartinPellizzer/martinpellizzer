                    <h1>Platanthera × vossii</h1>
<p>Platanthera × vossii, commonly known as the Voss's twayblade, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant is characterized by its greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct yellowish-green lip, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Platanthera × vossii thrives in moist, acidic soils within shaded, forested habitats, often near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
