                    <h1>Pleuropogon refractus var. hooverianus</h1>
<p>Pleuropogon refractus var. hooverianus, commonly known as the Hoover's false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands.</p>
<p>This variety is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
