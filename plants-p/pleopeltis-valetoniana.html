                    <h1>Pleopeltis valetoniana</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis valetoniana, commonly known as the Valeton's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
