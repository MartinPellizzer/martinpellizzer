                    <h1>Platanus orientalis var. acerifolia</h1>
<p>Platanus orientalis var. acerifolia, commonly known as the Oriental plane with maple leaves, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which resemble those of maple trees, and its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often planted for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy.</p>
<p>The varietal form acerifolia distinguishes it from the more common Platanus orientalis by its distinctive leaf shape.</p>
