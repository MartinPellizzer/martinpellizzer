<p>Pteris nemoralis var. major, commonly known as the large wall fern, is a variant of the common rock fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are pinnately divided and often have a leathery texture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
