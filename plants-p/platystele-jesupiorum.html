                    <h1>Platystele jesupiorum</h1>
<p>Platystele jesupiorum, commonly known as the Jesup's platter-leaf, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, flat, disc-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and conservationists.</p>
