<p>Pontederia meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in marshes and ponds. It is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant but also a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
