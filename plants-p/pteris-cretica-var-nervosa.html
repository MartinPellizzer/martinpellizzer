                    <h1>Pteris cretica var. nervosa</h1>
<p>Pteris cretica var. nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources or in humid, tropical climates. The plant's fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinct, narrow vein pattern that gives it its specific name. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions.</p>
