                    <h1>Parkinsonia spinosa</h1>
<p>Parkinsonia spinosa, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Parkinsonia spinosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
