                    <h1>Pinus palustris</h1>
<p>Pinus palustris, commonly known as the longleaf pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender needles that grow in bundles of three, and its distinctive, often fire-resistant cones. The tree can reach heights of up to 60 meters and has a lifespan that can exceed 300 years. Its root system is adapted to wet, sandy soils, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>The longleaf pine is also notable for its ability to regenerate after wildfires, which contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
