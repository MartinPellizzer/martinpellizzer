<p>Pinus arizonica subsp.</p>
<p>ornelasii, commonly known as the Ornelas's Apache pine, is a subspecies native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of its close relatives.</p>
<p>The tree produces cones that are woody and typically remain attached to the branches for several years. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing protection against fire and drought.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of desert and mountain ecosystems.</p>
