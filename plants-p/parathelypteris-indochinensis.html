                    <h1>Parathelypteris indochinensis</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris indochinensis, commonly known as the Indochina holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
