                    <h1>Philodendron pinnatilobum</h1>
<p>Philodendron pinnatilobum, commonly known as the red-veined philodendron, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with prominent, reddish veins that contrast strikingly with the foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a houseplant.</p>
