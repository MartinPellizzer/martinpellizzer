<p>Prosopis × vinalillo, commonly known as the Palo Verde tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prosopis flexuosa and Prosopis juliflora.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its green bark, which serves as a unique adaptation for photosynthesis in low-water environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by legume pods containing seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions and is often used in reforestation and soil stabilization efforts.</p>
