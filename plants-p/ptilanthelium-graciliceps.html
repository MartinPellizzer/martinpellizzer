                    <h1>Ptilanthelium graciliceps</h1>
<p>Ptilanthelium graciliceps, commonly known as the slender-headed fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, slender fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in small, compact structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
