                    <h1>Prunus conradinae</h1>
<p>Prunus conradinae, commonly known as the Conrad's cherry, is a rare and endangered species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, typical of many Prunus species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
