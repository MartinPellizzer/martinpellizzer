<p>Pterostylis saxum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, small, greenish-white flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, with three sepals and three petals, though the latter are often reduced.</p>
