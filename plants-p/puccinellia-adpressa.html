                    <h1>Puccinellia adpressa</h1>
<p>Puccinellia adpressa, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or along coastal areas. Its deep root system allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Puccinellia adpressa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
