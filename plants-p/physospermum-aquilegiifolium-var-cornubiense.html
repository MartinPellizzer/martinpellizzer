                    <h1>Physospermum aquilegiifolium var. cornubiense</h1>
<p>Physospermum aquilegiifolium var. cornubiense, commonly known as the Cornish bellflower, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the UK.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a contrasting throat. The leaves are deeply lobed, resembling those of the buttercup, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology.</p>
