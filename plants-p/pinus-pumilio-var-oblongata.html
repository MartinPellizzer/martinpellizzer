                    <h1>Pinus pumilio var. oblongata</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio var. oblongata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high elevations of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, conical shape and dense foliage, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The leaves are typically needle-like, short, and often persist for several years before shedding. This variant exhibits a unique growth habit, forming compact clumps rather than spreading out.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, windy environments with poor soil.</p>
