                    <h1>Potentilla polytricha</h1>
<p>Potentilla polytricha, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptical, with finely toothed margins and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Potentilla polytricha is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
