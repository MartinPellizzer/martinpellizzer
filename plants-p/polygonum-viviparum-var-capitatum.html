                    <h1>Polygonum viviparum var. capitatum</h1>
<p>Polygonum viviparum var. capitatum, commonly known as the water pepper or swamp willow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its reproductive strategy includes vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to colonize moist soils efficiently, making it a common species in marshy and riparian habitats.</p>
