                    <h1>Pteris repens</h1>
<p>Pteris repens, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it a graceful look. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to colonize and stabilize soil.</p>
