<p>Prosopis horrida, commonly known as the burro bush, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Prosopis horrida is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
