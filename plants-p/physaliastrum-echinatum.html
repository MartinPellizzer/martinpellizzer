<p>Physaliastrum echinatum, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in shallow, still water. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Physaliastrum echinatum is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
