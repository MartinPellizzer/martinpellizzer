<p>Polypodium polycarpum, commonly known as the everett's polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrated leaves. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Polypodium polycarpum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions.</p>
