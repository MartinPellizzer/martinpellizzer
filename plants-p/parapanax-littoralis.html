<p>Parapanax littoralis, commonly known as the coastal ginger or sea ginger, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its coastal habitat. Parapanax littoralis is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds.</p>
