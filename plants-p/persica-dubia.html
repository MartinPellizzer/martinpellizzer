                    <h1>Persica dubia</h1>
<p>Persica dubia, commonly known as the rare or ghost peach, is a less commonly studied species within the Prunus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale pink flowers and thin, fuzzy leaves, which are similar to those of other peach species. The plant is native to arid regions of Central Asia and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its fruit is small and typically not edible, though it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Persica dubia remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
