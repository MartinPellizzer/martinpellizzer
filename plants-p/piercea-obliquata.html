<p>Piercea obliquata, commonly known as the slender pincushion cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
