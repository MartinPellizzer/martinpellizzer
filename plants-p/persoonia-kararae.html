<p>Persoonia kararae, commonly known as the Karara Persoonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the spring. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. Persoonia kararae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a priority for conservation efforts.</p>
