                    <h1>Poa nemoralis var. juncoides</h1>
<p>Poa nemoralis var. juncoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity.</p>
