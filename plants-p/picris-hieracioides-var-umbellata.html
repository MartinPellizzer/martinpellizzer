<p>Picris hieracioides var. umbellata, commonly known as the umbellate sowthistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>

The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a taproot system and produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and potential to become invasive, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
