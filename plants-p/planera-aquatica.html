                    <h1>Planera aquatica</h1>
<p>Planera aquatica, commonly known as water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Planera aquatica plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration.</p>
