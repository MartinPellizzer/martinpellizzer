<p>Panicum latzii, commonly known as the Lutz panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Panicum latzii is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
