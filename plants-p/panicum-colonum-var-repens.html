<p>Panicum colonum var. repens, commonly known as匍匐牛筋草, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>It is often found in wet or disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and coastal areas.</p>
