<p>Paspalum reptans, commonly known as匍匐百里香, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomes that allow it to form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Paspalum reptans is sometimes used in erosion control due to its vigorous growth and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
