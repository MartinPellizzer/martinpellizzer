                    <h1>Polystichum lonchitis var. japonicum</h1>
<p>Polystichum lonchitis var. japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often arched or upright. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
