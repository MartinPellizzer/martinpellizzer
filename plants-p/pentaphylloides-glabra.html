                    <h1>Pentaphylloides glabra</h1>
<p>Pentaphylloides glabra, commonly known as the smooth pentaphylloid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glabrous (smooth) leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
