                    <h1>Pinguicula borealis</h1>
<p>Pinguicula borealis, commonly known as the northern butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in cold, nutrient-poor environments. It blooms with small, delicate flowers in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Pinguicula borealis plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through insect capture.</p>
