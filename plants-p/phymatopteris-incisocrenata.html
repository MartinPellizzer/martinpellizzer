<p>Phymatopteris incisocrenata, commonly known as the narrow-crenated wall-rue, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates.</p>
