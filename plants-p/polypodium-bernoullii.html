                    <h1>Polypodium bernoullii</h1>
<p>Polypodium bernoullii, commonly known as the Bernoulli's hart's-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that resemble the shape of a hart's tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiales order.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
