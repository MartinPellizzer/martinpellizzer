<p>Paronychia scoparia, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>Paronychia scoparia is often found in sandy soils and is a common component of desert and coastal dune vegetation.</p>
