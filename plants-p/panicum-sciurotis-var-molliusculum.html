<p>Panicum sciurotis var. molliusculum, commonly known as the woolly panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems in its native range.</p>
