                    <h1>Phyllocactus strictus</h1>
<p>Phyllocactus strictus, commonly known as the rigid phyllocactus, is a unique cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, spiny stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Phyllocactus strictus is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
