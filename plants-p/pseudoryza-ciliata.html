<p>Pseudoryza ciliata, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically green or brown in color. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Pseudoryza ciliata plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
