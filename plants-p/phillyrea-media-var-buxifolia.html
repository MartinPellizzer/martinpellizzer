                    <h1>Phillyrea media var. buxifolia</h1>
<p>Phillyrea media var. buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf Phillyrea, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, oval, dark green leaves that are often mistaken for those of boxwood due to their similar appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative hedge.</p>
