<p>Pinguicula macroceras subsp.</p>
<p>nortensis, commonly known as the Norten's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
