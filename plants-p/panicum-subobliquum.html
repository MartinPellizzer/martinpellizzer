                    <h1>Panicum subobliquum</h1>
<p>Panicum subobliquum, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often wind-dispersed. This plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects, it is valued in wetland restoration projects.</p>
