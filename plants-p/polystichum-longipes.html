<p>Polystichum longipes, commonly known as the long-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil while spreading vegetatively.</p>
