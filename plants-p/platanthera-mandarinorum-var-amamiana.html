                    <h1>Platanthera mandarinorum var. amamiana</h1>
<p>Platanthera mandarinorum var. amamiana, commonly known as the Amami orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Amami Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy, white to pale yellow flower. The plant thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky areas, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insects, and it has a limited geographic range, making it vulnerable to habitat loss.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and conservation status.</p>
