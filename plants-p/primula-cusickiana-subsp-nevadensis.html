<p>Primula cusickiana subsp.</p>
<p>nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations, often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It is closely related to other Primula species but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological characteristics.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
