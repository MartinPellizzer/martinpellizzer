<p>Planchonella papyracea, commonly known as the paperbark pomegranate, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that resembles paper, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits similar to pomegranates. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
