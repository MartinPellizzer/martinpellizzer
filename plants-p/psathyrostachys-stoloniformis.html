                    <h1>Psathyrostachys stoloniformis</h1>
<p>Psathyrostachys stoloniformis, commonly known as the stoloniferous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with creeping stolons that root at the nodes to form a thick turf. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Psathyrostachys stoloniformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
