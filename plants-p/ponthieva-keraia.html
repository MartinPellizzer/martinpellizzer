<p>Ponthieva keraia, commonly known as the Keraia fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Ponthieva keraia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
