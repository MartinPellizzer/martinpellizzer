                <h1>Pedicularis albiflora</h1>
<p>Pedicularis albiflora, commonly known as the white monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble small orchids, with spurred petals that are often mistaken for a monkey's face. Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of nearby host plants.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
