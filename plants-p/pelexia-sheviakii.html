<p>Pelexia sheviakii, commonly known as the Shishkin's pelexia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
