<p>Pedicularis sima, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it derives some nutrients from its host plants.</p>
<p>Pedicularis sima is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
