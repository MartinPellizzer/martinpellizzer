                    <h1>Poa friesiorum</h1>
<p>Poa friesiorum, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Poa friesiorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
