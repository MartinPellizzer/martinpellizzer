<p>Pulsatilla tatewakii, commonly known as the Japanese pasqueflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers well-drained, sunny habitats. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, basal leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky down.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pulsatilla tatewakii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
