                    <h1>Psorodendron amoenum</h1>
<p>Psorodendron amoenum, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its unique growth habit and specialized relationship with its host tree make it an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
