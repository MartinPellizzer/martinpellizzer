                    <h1>Pseudocorchorus cornutus</h1>
<p>Pseudocorchorus cornutus, commonly known as the horned spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Pseudocorchorus cornutus is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
