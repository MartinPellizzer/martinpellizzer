<p>Pseudoliparis raciborskii, commonly known as the golden alga, is a unicellular, filamentous cyanobacterium that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to form dense blooms, often leading to water discoloration and algal blooms. This organism is capable of nitrogen fixation, contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems. It exhibits a unique life cycle with both vegetative and reproductive stages.</p>
<p>However, its rapid growth can lead to eutrophication and pose challenges for water quality management.</p>
