<p>Pedicularis rubens var. alatavica, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, often in rocky or alpine habitats. It has slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
