                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris var. kochiana</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris var. kochiana, commonly known as the Scots pine variety Kochiana, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones are usually small and have a distinctive shape, with scales that open to release seeds. This variety thrives in cold, dry climates and is often found in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
