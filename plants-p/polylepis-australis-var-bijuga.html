<p>Polylepis australis var. bijuga, commonly known as the Andean polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects and birds. It thrives in cool, humid climates at high altitudes, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and is of significant ecological importance in its native range.</p>
