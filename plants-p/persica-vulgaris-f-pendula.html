                    <h1>Persica vulgaris f. pendula</h1>
<p>Persica vulgaris f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping peach.</p>
<p>This cultivar is a striking variation of the peach tree, characterized by its cascading branches that droop downward, creating a visually appealing, almost ethereal appearance. It retains the typical features of the peach plant, including its fuzzy leaves and showy pink or white flowers in spring. The fruit is similar to that of the common peach, though it may be slightly smaller and more delicate.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks due to its unique form and seasonal beauty.</p>
