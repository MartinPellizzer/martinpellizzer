<p>Pteronia leucoclada, commonly known as the white pteronia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Pteronia leucoclada is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
