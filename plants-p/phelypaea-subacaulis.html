                    <h1>Phelypaea subacaulis</h1>
<p>Phelypaea subacaulis, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant lacks a distinct stem, with the fronds directly arising from the rhizome, which anchors it in shallow water. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that help in maximizing light absorption in its aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>Phelypaea subacaulis plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
