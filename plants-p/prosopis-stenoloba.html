<p>Prosopis stenoloba, commonly known as the smallleaf mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Prosopis stenoloba plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
