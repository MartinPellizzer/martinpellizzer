<p>Prunus stocksiana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark red to black berries. Prunus stocksiana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and canyons.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural interest in drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
