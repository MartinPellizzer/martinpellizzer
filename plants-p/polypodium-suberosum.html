<p>Polypodium suberosum, commonly known as the thick-leafed wall fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are found on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium suberosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
