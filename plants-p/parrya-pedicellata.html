                    <h1>Parrya pedicellata</h1>
<p>Parrya pedicellata, commonly known as the white parrya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Parrya pedicellata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
