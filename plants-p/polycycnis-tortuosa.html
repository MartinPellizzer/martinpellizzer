The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in a helical pattern along its stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an important species for ecological studies of wetland ecosystems.</p>
