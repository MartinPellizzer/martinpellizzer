                    <h1>Pleurogramme graminifolia</h1>
<p>Pleurogramme graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to rocks or other substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and help in spreading across the water surface.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dimorphic, with fertile and sterile shoots differing in structure and appearance.</p>
