<p>Pellegrinia graebneriana, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens.</p>
