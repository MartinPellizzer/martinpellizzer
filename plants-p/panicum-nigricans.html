<p>Panicum nigricans, commonly known as black panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, dark green leaves that often turn reddish or purplish at maturity. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bristly florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Panicum nigricans is sometimes considered a weed but can also be used in erosion control and livestock forage.</p>
