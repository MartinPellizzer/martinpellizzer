<p>Picrella trifoliata var. gracillima, commonly known as the slender picrella, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>

The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, adding to its ornamental appeal. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
