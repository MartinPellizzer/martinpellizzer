                    <h1>Polystichum fragile</h1>
<p>Polystichum fragile, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a tall, upright rhizome with densely packed, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, giving the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate, easily broken fronds, it is well-suited for shaded garden settings where it can flourish without being disturbed.</p>
