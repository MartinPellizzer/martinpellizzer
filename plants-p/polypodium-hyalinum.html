<p>Polypodium hyalinum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-directional, meaning they can grow both upward and downward, which is a unique feature among ferns.</p>
