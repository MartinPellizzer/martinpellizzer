                    <h1>Perianthostelma</h1>
<p>Perianthostelma, commonly known as the perianthostelma, is a specialized plant structure found in certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>It refers to the fused tissues of the perianth (which includes sepals and petals) and the stelma, which is the central part of the flower's reproductive structures. This fusion creates a unique floral morphology that can vary in complexity among different species. The perianthostelma often plays a role in protecting the reproductive organs and may also be involved in pollination mechanisms.</p>
<p>Its presence and structure can be used as a taxonomic feature in plant classification.</p>
