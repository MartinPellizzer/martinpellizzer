                    <h1>Panax lokobensis</h1>
<p>Panax lokobensis, commonly known as the Lokob√© ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species of the ginseng family (Araliaceae).</p>
<p>Native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red berries. Its roots, similar to other ginsengs, are believed to have medicinal properties, though research on its chemical composition is limited.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, Panax lokobensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
