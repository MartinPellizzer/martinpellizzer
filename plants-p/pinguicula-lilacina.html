                    <h1>Pinguicula lilacina</h1>
<p>Pinguicula lilacina, commonly known as the purple butterwort, is a species of carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are covered in glandular hairs, which secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces delicate, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are not only adhesive but also capable of digesting captured prey, providing essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Pinguicula lilacina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
