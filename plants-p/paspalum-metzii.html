                    <h1>Paspalum metzii</h1>
<p>Paspalum metzii, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune habitats and along the edges of saltwater bodies. It is drought-tolerant and salt-resistant, making it well-suited for coastal environments.</p>
<p>Paspalum metzii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife species.</p>
