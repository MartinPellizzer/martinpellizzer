                    <h1>Piper mite</h1>
<p>Piper mite, commonly known as the pepper mite, is a tiny arachnid belonging to the family Tetranychidae.</p>
<p>It is often found on the undersides of leaves of various plants, including peppers and other solanaceous crops. These mites feed on plant sap, which can cause damage to the foliage and reduce crop yield. They are usually green or yellow in color and can be difficult to spot without close inspection.</p>
<p>Due to their small size and rapid reproduction, they can quickly infest plants if left unchecked.</p>
