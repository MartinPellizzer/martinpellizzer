<p>Plantago durvillei var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by bracts. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
