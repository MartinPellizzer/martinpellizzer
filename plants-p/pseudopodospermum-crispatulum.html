                    <h1>Pseudopodospermum crispatulum</h1>
<p>Pseudopodospermum crispatulum, commonly known as the hairy podded milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, pod-like fruits that are covered in fine, bristly hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The hairy pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
