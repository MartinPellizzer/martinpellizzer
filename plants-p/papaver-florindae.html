<p>Papaver florindae, commonly known as the Florindan poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red petals that resemble those of the common poppy, though it is smaller in size. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
