<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant forms dense, low-growing clumps with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae.</p>
<p>Polystichum sublentum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
