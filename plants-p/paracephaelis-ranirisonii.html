<p>Paracephaelis ranirisonii, commonly known as the Ranirisonii ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar, where it often grows on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white and pale purple, are pollinated by specific insects, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Paracephaelis ranirisonii is considered critically endangered.</p>
