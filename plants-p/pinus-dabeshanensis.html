<p>Pinus dabeshanensis, commonly known as Dabeshan pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in fascicles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and persist on the tree for several years. It thrives in mountainous regions with well-drained soils and a temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
