                    <h1>Parajubaea torallyi var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Parajubaea torallyi var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf parajubaea, is a rare and endangered cycad native to the Andes of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact size, with a short trunk and a crown of narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it highly vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species.</p>
