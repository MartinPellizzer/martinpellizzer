                    <h1>Psathyrostachys desertorum</h1>
<p>Psathyrostachys desertorum, commonly known as the desert wild rye, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, typically blooming in late spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
