                    <h1>Paneion</h1>
<p>Paneion, commonly known as the Mediterranean stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the summer months. Paneion is often found growing on rocky soils and slopes, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, Paneion, is derived from the Greek word for "stone," reflecting its preference for rocky habitats.</p>
