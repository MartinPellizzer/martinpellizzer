                    <h1>Polyachyrus nivalis</h1>
<p>Polyachyrus nivalis, commonly known as the snow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. This lichen is typically found on rock surfaces or soil in alpine and arctic regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Its slow growth rate makes it a sensitive indicator of environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat.</p>
