<p>Prunus insititia var. italica, commonly known as the Italian blackthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge and white or pale pink flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The berries are also used in making jams and wines, though they are generally too tart for direct consumption.</p>
