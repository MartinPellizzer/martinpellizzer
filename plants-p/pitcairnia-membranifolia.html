                    <h1>Pitcairnia membranifolia</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety covering, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that aids in water collection.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia membranifolia is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
