<p>Puya paupera, commonly known as the poor man's torch, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a striking plant with tall, spiky inflorescences that can reach up to 3 meters in height, displaying vibrant red, orange, and yellow flowers.

It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its dramatic appearance and relatively low maintenance, Puya paupera is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
