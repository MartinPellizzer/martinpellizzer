<p>Potentilla ponale, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, deciduous leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
