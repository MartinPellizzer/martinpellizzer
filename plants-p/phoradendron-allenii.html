                    <h1>Phoradendron allenii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron allenii, commonly known as the Allen's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval leaves and white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically red or yellow and serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Phoradendron allenii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting biodiversity and contributing to the structure of the forest canopy.</p>
