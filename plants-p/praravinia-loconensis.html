<p>Praravinia loconensis, commonly known as the Loconese praravinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Praravinia loconensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
