                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris f. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf Scots pine, is a compact form of the Scots pine characterized by its smaller, more densely packed needles.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Europe and thrives in cold, temperate climates. The plant has a slow growth rate, which contributes to its compact and bushy appearance. Its foliage is often a dark green, and it produces cones that are typically smaller than those of the typical Scots pine.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
