                    <h1>Pteris falcata var. rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Pteris falcata var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its distinctly rounded fronds.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The fronds are pinnately divided with a smooth, waxy surface and a unique, almost fan-like shape. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
