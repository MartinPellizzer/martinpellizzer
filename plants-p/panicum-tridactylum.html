<p>Panicum tridactylum, commonly known as little barley, is a grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
