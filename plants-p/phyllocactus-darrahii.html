                    <h1>Phyllocactus darrahii</h1>
<p>Phyllocactus darrahii, commonly known as the Darrah's phyllocactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its growth habit is typically compact, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Despite its resilience, it is sensitive to overwatering and requires well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
