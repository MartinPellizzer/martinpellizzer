<p>Phlegmariurus espinosanus, commonly known as the Spiny Clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus espinosanus is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its historical significance in paleobotanical studies.</p>
