                    <h1>Potentilla osterhoutii var. typica</h1>
<p>Potentilla osterhoutii var. typica, commonly known as the Osterhout's potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
