                    <h1>Puccinellia pusilla</h1>
<p>Puccinellia pusilla, commonly known as dwarf needlegrass, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and sandy areas, and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>Puccinellia pusilla is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
