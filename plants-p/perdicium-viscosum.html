                    <h1>Perdicium viscosum</h1>
<p>Perdicium viscosum, commonly known as the sticky partridge grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky, waxy substance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences, followed by small, dry fruits known as achenes. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its sticky secretions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
