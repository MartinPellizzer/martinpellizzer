<p>Polypodium transpiananense, commonly known as the Transpiananese fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America, particularly found in Brazil and Colombia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with dense, leathery fronds that are often clustered at the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
