<p>Pteris splendida var. longlinensis, commonly known as the Longlin cliff brake, is a fern native to China, particularly found in the Guangxi and Guangdong provinces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky or cliff faces. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its striking foliage.</p>
