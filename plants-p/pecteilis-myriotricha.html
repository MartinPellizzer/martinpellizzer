                    <h1>Pecteilis myriotricha</h1>
<p>Pecteilis myriotricha, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fuzzy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, rounded seed pods that disperse its seeds by wind. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Pecteilis myriotricha plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
