                    <h1>Placus belangerianus</h1>
<p>Placus belangerianus, commonly known as the Belanger's plume, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Placus belangerianus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
