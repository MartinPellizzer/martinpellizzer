<p>Pachyphyllum ecallosum, commonly known as the thick-leaved ice plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Pachyphyllum ecallosum is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
