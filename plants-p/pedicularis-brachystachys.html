                    <h1>Pedicularis brachystachys</h1>
<p>Pedicularis brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family. This species is characterized by its bilaterally symmetrical flowers, which typically feature a spurred petal and a hooded structure. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients, and it often grows in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
