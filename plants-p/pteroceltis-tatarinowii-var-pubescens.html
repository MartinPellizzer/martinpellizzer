<p>Pteroceltis tatarinowii var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent winged elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The tree produces small, winged samaras that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is due to its unique foliage and ability to tolerate urban environments.</p>
