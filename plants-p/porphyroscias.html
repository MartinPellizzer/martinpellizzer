<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often feature vibrant red or orange hues. Porphyroscias species typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrials, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
