                    <h1>Phoradendron affine</h1>
<p>Phoradendron affine, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, green leaves that perform photosynthesis, while its flowers are typically white or pale green and are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are often red, are an important food source for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Phoradendron affine plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and supporting wildlife.</p>
