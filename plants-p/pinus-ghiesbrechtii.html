                    <h1>Pinus ghiesbrechtii</h1>
<p>Pinus ghiesbrechtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbrecht's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the pine family. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Pinus ghiesbrechtii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
