                    <h1>Psilotrichum axilliflorum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum axilliflorum, commonly known as the axillary-flowered psilotrichum, is a rare and unique fern-like plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the absence of true leaves, instead possessing small, scale-like structures called rhizomes. The plant produces sporangia in clusters at the axils of its stems, a feature that distinguishes it from many other ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
