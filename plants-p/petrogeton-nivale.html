<p>Petrogeton nivale, commonly known as the snow petrogeton, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and barren soils, often found in high-altitude environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it blooms in late summer.</p>
<p>Petrogeton nivale plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments and is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
