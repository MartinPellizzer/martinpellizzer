                    <h1>Polypodium costaricense</h1>
<p>Polypodium costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican polypody, is a species of fern native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle.</p>
