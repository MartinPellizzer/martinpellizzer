<p>Pyrenoglyphis chaetorhachis, commonly known as the hairy-spike fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its intricate frond structure.</p>
<p>Its fronds are composed of multiple pinnae, each bearing small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The genus Pyrenoglyphis is notable for its distinctive spore morphology, which aids in its identification and classification.</p>
