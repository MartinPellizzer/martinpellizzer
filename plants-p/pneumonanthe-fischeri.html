                    <h1>Pneumonanthe fischeri</h1>
<p>Pneumonanthe fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's lungwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
