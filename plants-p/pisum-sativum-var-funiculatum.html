                    <h1>Pisum sativum var. funiculatum</h1>
<p>Pisum sativum var. funiculatum, commonly known as the funiculate pea, is a botanical variety of the pea plant characterized by its unique seed structure.</p>
<p>The seeds of this variety are elongated and have a fibrous, funiculate attachment to the pod, which distinguishes it from other pea varieties. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions where it has adapted to thrive in less hospitable conditions. The plant produces small, often pea-green pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its unique morphological features and potential for genetic study.</p>
