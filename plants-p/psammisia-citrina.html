<p>Psammisia citrina, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Psammisia citrina is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions.</p>
