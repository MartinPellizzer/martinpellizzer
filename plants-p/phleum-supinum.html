<p>Phleum supinum, commonly known as creeping barleygrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color when fresh.</p>
<p>It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock.</p>
