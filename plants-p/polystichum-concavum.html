                    <h1>Polystichum concavum</h1>
<p>Polystichum concavum, commonly known as the concave wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The fronds are typically a dark green color and have a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
