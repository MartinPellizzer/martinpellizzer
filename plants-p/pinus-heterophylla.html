                    <h1>Pinus heterophylla</h1>
<p>Pinus heterophylla, commonly known as the Apache pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with juvenile leaves being needle-like and adult leaves often becoming scale-like. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid to semi-arid environments. Its cones are woody and contain two to three seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The Apache pine is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem.</p>
