<p>Potentilla petrophila var. cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Sierra madre potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
