                    <h1>Papaver somniferum var. setigerum</h1>
<p>Papaver somniferum var. setigerum, commonly known as the hairy poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its botanical features include a taproot system and capsule fruits that contain alkaloids, some of which are chemically similar to those found in the main species of opium poppy.</p>
<p>Due to its potential for producing narcotics, it is often regulated in many countries.</p>
