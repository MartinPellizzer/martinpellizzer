<p>Phegopteris villosa, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are covered in soft, hairy structures, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Phegopteris villosa is an important component of the forest understory in its native habitat.</p>
