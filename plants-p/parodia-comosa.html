<p>Parodia comosa, commonly known as the woolly globular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that covers the entire plant, giving it a soft, almost fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in a globular shape, with short, thick stems and small, spiny areoles. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Parodia comosa is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
