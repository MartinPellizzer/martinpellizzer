                    <h1>Pyrus vajdae</h1>
<p>Pyrus vajdae, commonly known as the Vajda pear, is a rare and little-studied species of pear native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rugged fruit with a thick, sometimes hairy skin. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus vajdae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
