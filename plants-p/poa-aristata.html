                    <h1>Poa aristata</h1>
<p>Poa aristata, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Poa aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, resilient nature.</p>
