                    <h1>Peristylus plantagineus</h1>
<p>Peristylus plantagineus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against cold and desiccation.</p>
<p>Peristylus plantagineus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky, high-altitude habitats.</p>
