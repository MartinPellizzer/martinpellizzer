                    <h1>Poa capitata</h1>
<p>Poa capitata, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and have a bluish-green color, which helps it thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments. It is often found in meadows, alpine tundra, and rocky areas where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Poa capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and resilient nature.</p>
