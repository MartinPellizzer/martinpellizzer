                            <h1>Poa Angustifolia Subsp. Pratensis</h1>
<p>Narrowleaf meadowgrass, scientifically known as Poa angustifolia subsp. pratensis, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and stream banks. This plant is characterized by its slender leaves and compact growth habit, making it a common sight in low-lying areas. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various herbivores and its contribution to soil stabilization. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
