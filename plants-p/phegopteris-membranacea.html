                    <h1>Phegopteris membranacea</h1>
<p>Phegopteris membranacea, commonly known as the membranous water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically light green and have a membranous texture. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually divided into small, narrow segments that help in photosynthesis and gas exchange.</p>
