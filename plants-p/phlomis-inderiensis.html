<p>Phlomis inderiensis, commonly known as the Kashmir wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
