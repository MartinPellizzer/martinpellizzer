                    <h1>Psittacanthus excrenulatus</h1>
<p>Psittacanthus excrenulatus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and a rosette of leathery, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
