                            <h1>Peganum Harmala Var. Crithmifolium</h1>
<p>Harmal, scientifically known as Peganum harmala var. crithmifolium, is a resilient plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and the Middle East. It thrives in harsh environments, often growing on rocky soils and in areas with limited water availability. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and distinctive, branched stems that help it withstand extreme temperatures. Harmal has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its unique chemical composition has also attracted scientific interest for potential pharmaceutical applications.</p>
