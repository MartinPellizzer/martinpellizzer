<p>Plantago barbata f. minor, commonly known as the lesser plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, branched flowering stalks that bear small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Plantago barbata.</p>
