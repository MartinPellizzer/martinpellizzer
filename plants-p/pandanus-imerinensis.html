<p>Pandanus imerinensis, commonly known as the Lepidoptera pandanus, is a species of palm native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, adapting well to salty air and sandy soils. Its inflorescences produce small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds.</p>
<p>The fruit, which is a fibrous husk enclosing a hard seed, is not typically consumed by humans but plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
