<p>Pteris cadieri subsp.</p>
<p>cadieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
