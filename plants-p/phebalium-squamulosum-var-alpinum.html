                    <h1>Phebalium squamulosum var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Phebalium squamulosum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine phebalium, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cool, dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
