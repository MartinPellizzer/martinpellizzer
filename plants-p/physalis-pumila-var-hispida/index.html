                            <h1>Physalis Pumila Var. Hispida</h1>
<p>Physalis pumila var. hispida is a hardy trailing plant known for its distinctive red calyces that encase its small, edible berries. Native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, it thrives in warm, sunny environments with well-drained soil. This variety is often referred to as the "hairy ground cherry" due to its fuzzy leaves and stems. It is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental plant with edible rewards. Its unique appearance and versatility make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and home growers alike.</p>
