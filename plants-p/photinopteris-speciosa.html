<p>Photinopteris speciosa, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with golden spore cases. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in spore dispersal.</p>
<p>The golden fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
