                    <h1>Poa hispidula var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa hispidula var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. One of its notable features is its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which can root and grow into new plants while still attached to the parent.</p>
<p>This trait makes it an important species in ecological restoration and soil stabilization efforts.</p>
