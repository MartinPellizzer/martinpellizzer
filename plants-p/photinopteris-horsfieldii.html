<p>Photinopteris horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like growth, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves differing in structure and appearance.</p>
