<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in the salty, windy coastal environment.</p>
<p>Pleiospermium littorale plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
