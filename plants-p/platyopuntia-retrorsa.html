                    <h1>Platyopuntia retrorsa</h1>
<p>Platyopuntia retrorsa, commonly known as the desert globe cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Platyopuntia retrorsa is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
