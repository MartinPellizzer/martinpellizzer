                    <h1>Prangos uloptera var. brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Prangos uloptera var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded goat's beard, is a rare and lesser-known botanical species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and distinctive, feathery inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
