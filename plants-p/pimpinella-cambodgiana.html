                    <h1>Pimpinella cambodgiana</h1>
<p>Pimpinella cambodgiana, commonly known as Cambodian parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia, and thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish flowers arranged in compound umbels. Its roots and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
