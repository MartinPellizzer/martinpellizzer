                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. nanum</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a dense rosette formation. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
