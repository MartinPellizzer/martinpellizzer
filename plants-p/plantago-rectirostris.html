<p>Plantago rectirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are ribbed and have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds.</p>
