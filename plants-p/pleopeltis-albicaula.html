<p>Pleopeltis albicaula, commonly known as the white-veined rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds with a distinctive white vein pattern. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spores are produced in small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pleopeltis albicaula is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
