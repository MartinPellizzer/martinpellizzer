                    <h1>Polypodium androgynum var. megalodus</h1>
<p>Polypodium androgynum var. megalodus, commonly known as the giant sword fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its large, sword-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its fronds can grow up to several feet in length, with a distinctive, leathery texture and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, forested habitats.</p>
