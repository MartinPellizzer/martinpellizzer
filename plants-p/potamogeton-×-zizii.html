                    <h1>Potamogeton × zizii</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × zizii, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton zizanioides, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, clustered flowers. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential can lead to dense vegetation that affects water flow and biodiversity.</p>
