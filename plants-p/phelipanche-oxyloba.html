                    <h1>Phelipanche oxyloba</h1>
<p>Phelipanche oxyloba, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its yellowish or brownish stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its parasitic nature. It typically infests crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, causing significant yield losses.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a noxious weed in many agricultural regions.</p>
