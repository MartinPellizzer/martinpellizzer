                    <h1>Plantago aristata var. minuta</h1>
<p>Plantago aristata var. minuta, commonly known as the small-leaved plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical Plantago aristata by its smaller leaves and more compact growth habit.</p>
