                    <h1>Phoradendron woodsonii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron woodsonii, commonly known as the woodsonâ€™s mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glossy, evergreen leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its life cycle involves seed dispersal by birds, which consume the fruits and deposit the seeds on new host trees.</p>
<p>This unique relationship with its host trees highlights its ecological significance in forest ecosystems.</p>
