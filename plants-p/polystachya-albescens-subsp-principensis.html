<p>Polystachya albescens subsp.</p>
<p>principensis, commonly known as the Principes ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and sepals, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
