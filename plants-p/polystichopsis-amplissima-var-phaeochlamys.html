<p>Polystichopsis amplissima var. phaeochlamys, commonly known as the dark frond fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed polystichopsis species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a lush, dense appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments, making it a common sight in forest understories. Its fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value.</p>
