                    <h1>Populus cordata</h1>
<p>Populus cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 3 to 6 inches long and have a distinctive serrated margin. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among members of the Populus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The bark of Populus cordata is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is relatively fast-growing.</p>
