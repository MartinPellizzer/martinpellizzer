                    <h1>Pinus conglomerata</h1>
<p>Pinus conglomerata, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling crown and scaly bark that becomes thick and furrowed with age. The tree produces cones that hang downward, containing edible seeds known as pine nuts. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with fungi, enhancing nutrient absorption in poor soils.</p>
<p>Pinus conglomerata is adapted to harsh alpine environments, tolerating cold temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
