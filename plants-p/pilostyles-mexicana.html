                    <h1>Pilostyles mexicana</h1>
<p>Pilostyles mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves and stems, with its energy derived solely from its host. It produces small, white or pale flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle, it is rarely seen and has limited geographic distribution.</p>
