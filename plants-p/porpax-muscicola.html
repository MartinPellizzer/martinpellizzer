                    <h1>Porpax muscicola</h1>
<p>Porpax muscicola, commonly known as the mossy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, greenish to yellowish thallus that resembles a moss, often growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil. The plant consists of a symbiotic association between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, which allows it to carry out photosynthesis. Its structure includes a upper cortex, a photosynthetic layer, and a lower cortex, with the cyanobacteria concentrated in the medulla.</p>
<p>Porpax muscicola plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
