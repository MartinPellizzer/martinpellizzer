                    <h1>Platantheroides parvidens</h1>
<p>Platantheroides parvidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in some regions.</p>
