<p>Primula farinosa subsp.</p>
<p>davurica, commonly known as the Siberian primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it its scientific name "farinosa," meaning floury.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
