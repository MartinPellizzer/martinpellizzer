<p>Psilurus aristatus f. hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss species characterized by its distinctive hairy texture on its stems.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a low-growing, carpet-like growth habit with small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, produce spores that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
