<p>Polypodium dryopteris var. calcareum, commonly known as the calcareous wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to calcareous soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
