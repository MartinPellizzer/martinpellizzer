                    <h1>Piptanthocereus calcirupicola var. pluricostatus</h1>
<p>Piptanthocereus calcirupicola var. pluricostatus, commonly known as the rock-cushion cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly adapted to rocky soils, thriving on cliffs and rocky outcrops where it forms a dense, mat-like growth.</p>
