<p>Populus gallica, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found growing near rivers and in moist soils.</p>
<p>Populus gallica is valued for its rapid growth and historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>
