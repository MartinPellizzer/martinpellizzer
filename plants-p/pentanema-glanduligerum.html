                    <h1>Pentanema glanduligerum</h1>
<p>Pentanema glanduligerum, commonly known as the sticky-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in glandular structures, which secrete a sticky substance. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
