                    <h1>Polypodium fraxinifolium var. adnatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium fraxinifolium var. adnatum, commonly known as the smooth-leafed cliff fern, is a variant of the rock fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded, humid environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh, calcareous substrates and its role in stabilizing rocky habitats.</p>
