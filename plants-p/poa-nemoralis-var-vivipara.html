                    <h1>Poa nemoralis var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa nemoralis var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce viviparous offspring, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This unique reproductive strategy allows it to colonize disturbed or nutrient-poor soils more effectively. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and along pathways.</p>
