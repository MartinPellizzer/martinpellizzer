                    <h1>Pothos ledermannii var. caudatus</h1>
<p>Pothos ledermannii var. caudatus, commonly known as the curly serpent plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that often have a wavy or curled edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to climb or trail from shelves and hanging baskets.</p>
