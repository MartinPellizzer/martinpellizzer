                    <h1>Peristylus iyoensis</h1>
<p>Peristylus iyoensis, commonly known as the Iyoensis Peristylus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its botanical features include a slender stem and an aromatic scent, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
