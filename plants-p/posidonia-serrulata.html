<p>Posidonia serrulata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a seagrass species native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>It forms dense underwater meadows that play a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and maintaining water clarity. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically bright green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through rhizomes, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Posidonia serrulata also provides essential habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
