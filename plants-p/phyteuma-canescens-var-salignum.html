<p>Phyteuma canescens var. salignum, commonly known as the saltbush phyteuma, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in saline and arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its adaptability to salty soils makes it a hardy species often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats.</p>
