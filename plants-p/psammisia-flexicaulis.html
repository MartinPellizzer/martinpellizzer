                    <h1>Psammisia flexicaulis</h1>
<p>Psammisia flexicaulis, commonly known as the sand dune plant, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as high temperatures and low moisture. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Its narrow, fleshy leaves reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The small, inconspicuous flowers are typically yellow or green, adapted for pollination by wind or specialized insects.</p>
