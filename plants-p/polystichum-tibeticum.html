<p>Polystichum tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
