                    <h1>Pachycereus calvus</h1>
<p>Pachycereus calvus, commonly known as the desert barrel cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with a short, thick base and produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, providing protection while allowing for some light penetration.</p>
<p>Pachycereus calvus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
