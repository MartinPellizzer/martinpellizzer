                    <h1>Phoradendron falcifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron falcifolium, commonly known as the Mexican devil's ivy, is a species of mistletoe native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an hemiparasitic plant, meaning it attaches to a host tree and derives some of its nutrients from it while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small white or pale green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries.</p>
<p>This species is often found growing on the branches of trees such as oaks and ceiba in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
