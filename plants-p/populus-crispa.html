<p>Populus crispa, commonly known as the curly poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>

Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Populus crispa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
