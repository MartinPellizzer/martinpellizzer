                    <h1>Passerina tingitana</h1>
<p>Passerina tingitana, commonly known as the Moroccan wall gecko, is a small, agile lizard native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body, long tail, and distinctive coloration that helps it blend into rocky environments. This species is often found climbing on walls, rocks, and buildings, where it hunts for insects. Its botanical relevance lies in its habitat preference for arid and semi-arid regions with rocky substrates.</p>
<p>While not a plant, it plays a role in the ecosystem by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for larger predators.</p>
