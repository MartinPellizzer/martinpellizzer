<p>Polygonum sawatchense subsp.</p>
<p>oblivium, commonly known as the oblivion polygon, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Colorado Rockies. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive bracteate inflorescences and stipitate nodes.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spikelike arrangements.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
