<p>Phleum cornutum, commonly known as the horned oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive awns, or bristle-like structures, that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>Phleum cornutum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
