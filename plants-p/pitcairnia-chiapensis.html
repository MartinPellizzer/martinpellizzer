                    <h1>Pitcairnia chiapensis</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
