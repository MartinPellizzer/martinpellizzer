                    <h1>Psammisia micrantha</h1>
<p>Psammisia micrantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Psammisia micrantha plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
