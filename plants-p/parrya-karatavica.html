<p>Parrya karatavica, commonly known as the Karatava parrya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on alpine flora and ecological adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
