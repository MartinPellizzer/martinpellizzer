                    <h1>Pseudolepanthes</h1>
<p>Pseudolepanthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble small, delicate blossoms. Pseudolepanthes species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. They are native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many species of Pseudolepanthes are considered endangered.</p>
