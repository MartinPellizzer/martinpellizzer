                    <h1>Poa arctica var. depauperata</h1>
<p>Poa arctica var. depauperata, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats close to the ground, with slender, hairless stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems.</p>
