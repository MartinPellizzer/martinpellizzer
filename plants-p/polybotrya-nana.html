<p>Polybotrya nana, commonly known as the dwarf Christmas fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing habit with arching, glossy dark green fronds that resemble those of the Christmas fern. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
