<p>Polypodium piligerum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
