<p>Panicum ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a loose, open panicle. The plant produces small, two-lobed flowers that are clustered in a branched inflorescence, which is a distinguishing feature of the Panicum genus. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its growth habit makes it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
