                    <h1>Populus dubia</h1>
<p>Populus dubia, commonly known as the elusive poplar, is a rare and enigmatic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often deciduous branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common trait among poplar species. Its bark is smooth and light gray, with a tendency to flake in older trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Populus dubia is considered a conservation concern.</p>
