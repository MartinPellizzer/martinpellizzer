                    <h1>Pimpinella magna f. dissecta</h1>
<p>Pimpinella magna f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected cowparsley, is a variant of the cowparsley species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are often more delicate than those of the typical species. Its flowers are small, white, and arranged in umbels, typical of theApiaceae family.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of this form make it distinct in appearance and ecological niche compared to other members of the species.</p>
