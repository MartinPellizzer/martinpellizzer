                    <h1>Parnassia palustris f. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Parnassia palustris f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf ladies' smock, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in northern regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems are short and often bend over, with fewer flowers than the typical form of Parnassia palustris.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its smaller size and is often found in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
