                    <h1>Paepalanthus ekmanii</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus ekmanii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian burro's tail, is a succulent plant native to the Andes region of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
