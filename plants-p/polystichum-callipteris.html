<p>Polystichum callipteris, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
