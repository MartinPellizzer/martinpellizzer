<p>Packera schweinitziana, commonly known as Schweinitz's rockfoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically covered in white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a composite head, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
