                    <h1>Pyrus pedrottiana</h1>
<p>Pyrus pedrottiana, commonly known as the Pedrotti pear, is a rare and ornamental species of pear native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically small and yellowish in color. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit yield. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
