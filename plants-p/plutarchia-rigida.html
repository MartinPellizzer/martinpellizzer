                    <h1>Plutarchia rigida</h1>
<p>Plutarchia rigida, commonly known as the rigid plume, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and clusters of delicate, feathery flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Plutarchia rigida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
