                    <h1>Pedicularis armata var. armata</h1>
<p>Pedicularis armata var. armata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flower, which is typically red or orange with a yellow throat. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
