                    <h1>Pinus × digenea</h1>
<p>Pinus × digenea, commonly known as the Mexican white pine hybrid.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Pinus strobiformis and Pinus hartwegii, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The tree typically exhibits a conical shape with long, slender needles that are often bluish-green in color. Its cones are relatively small and have a distinctive shape, while the bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>This hybrid is native to central Mexico and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
