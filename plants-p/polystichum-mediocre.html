<p>Polystichum mediocre, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
