                    <h1>Pycreus retusus</h1>
<p>Pycreus retusus, commonly known as the rough pycreus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas.</p>
