                    <h1>Potamogeton perfoliatus var. rotundifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton perfoliatus var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, round leaves that are often perforated at the base, allowing the stems to pass through. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and can form dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or water.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
