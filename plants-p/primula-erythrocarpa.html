                    <h1>Primula erythrocarpa</h1>
<p>Primula erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of broad, dark green, slightly hairy leaves that form a dense basal layer. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive red calyx that persists after flowering. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The red calyces are not only ornamental but also serve as a protective structure for the developing fruits.</p>
