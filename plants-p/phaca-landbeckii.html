                    <h1>Phaca landbeckii</h1>
<p>Phaca landbeckii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can go dormant during extreme droughts.</p>
<p>Phaca landbeckii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing food for local wildlife.</p>
