<p>Pleurothallis ignota, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on air and rain for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers with a unique, almost translucent appearance. It is noted for its rarity and is often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pleurothallis ignota is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
