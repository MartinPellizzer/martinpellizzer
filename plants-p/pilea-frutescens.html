<p>Pilea frutescens, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China.</p>
<p>It features rounded, fleshy leaves that are often described as resembling small coins, which is the source of its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pilea frutescens is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements.</p>
