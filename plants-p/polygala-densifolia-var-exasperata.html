                    <h1>Polygala densifolia var. exasperata</h1>
<p>Polygala densifolia var. exasperata, commonly known as the exasperated milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that often grow from a fibrous root system adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color, with prominent stamens that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical study remains limited.</p>
