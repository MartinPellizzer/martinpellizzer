<p>Peucedanum lubimenkoanum, commonly known as the Lubimenko's angelica, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>

The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
