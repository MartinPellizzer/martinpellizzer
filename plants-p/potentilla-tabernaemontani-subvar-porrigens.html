                    <h1>Potentilla tabernaemontani subvar. porrigens</h1>
<p>Potentilla tabernaemontani subvar. porrigens, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is dense and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
