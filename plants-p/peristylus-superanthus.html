                    <h1>Peristylus superanthus</h1>
<p>Peristylus superanthus, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with bright yellow tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique branching pattern, with multiple stems emerging from a central base, creating a bushy appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid native habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and bats, contributing to its ecological significance in its ecosystem.</p>
