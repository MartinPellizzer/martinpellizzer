<p>Pilosella schultesii subsp.</p>
<p>acariaea, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
