<p>Polygala xerophytica, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has adapted to xerophytic conditions through features such as thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
