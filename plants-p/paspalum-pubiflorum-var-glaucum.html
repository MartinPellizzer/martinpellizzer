<p>Paspalum pubiflorum var. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in spikelets, typically flowering during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a useful species for erosion control and forage in certain regions.</p>
