                            <h1>Polystichum × Uliginosum</h1>
<p>Carrion fern, scientifically known as Polystichum × uliginosum, is a unique and striking plant that thrives in wet, shaded environments. This hybrid fern is named for its association with decaying organic matter, often found in swampy or boggy areas. Its dark green, leathery fronds have a distinctive appearance that resembles the decaying vegetation it commonly grows among. Despite its ominous reputation, the Carrion fern is a hardy and resilient species that plays an important ecological role in its habitat. It is both a fascinating subject for botanists and a symbol of nature's ability to flourish in challenging conditions.</p>
