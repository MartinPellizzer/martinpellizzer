                    <h1>Phippsia maritima</h1>
<p>Phippsia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is well-adapted to maritime conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Phippsia maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
