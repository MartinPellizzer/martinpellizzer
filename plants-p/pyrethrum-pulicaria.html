<p>Pyrethrum pulicaria, commonly known as common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>

The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
