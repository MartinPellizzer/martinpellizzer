                    <h1>Physalis pringlei</h1>
<p>Physalis pringlei, commonly known as the silverleaf groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red capsules. The plant produces small, edible berries enclosed within a papery husk, similar to other members of the Physalis genus. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in arid regions.</p>
