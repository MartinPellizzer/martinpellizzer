                    <h1>Paspalum hallii</h1>
<p>Paspalum hallii, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in coastal areas, tolerating saline soils and frequent exposure to wind and salt spray. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
<p>Paspalum hallii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing turf in maritime environments.</p>
