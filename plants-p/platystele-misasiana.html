<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in the shaded, humid understory of tropical forests. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a unique, ghostly appearance, which contribute to its common name. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
