                    <h1>Plantago alopecuroides</h1>
<p>Plantago alopecuroides, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts.</p>
