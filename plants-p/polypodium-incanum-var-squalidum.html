                    <h1>Polypodium incanum var. squalidum</h1>
<p>Polypodium incanum var. squalidum, commonly known as the squalid staghorn fern, is a variant of the staghorn fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic fern, meaning it grows on rocks or tree trunks rather than in soil. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery, antler-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a fine, whitish down. It prefers humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity to thrive.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
