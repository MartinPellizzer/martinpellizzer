<p>Poa pseudoabbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and fine, blue-green blades that form dense, mat-like growths. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Poa pseudoabbreviata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates.</p>
