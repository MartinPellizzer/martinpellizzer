                    <h1>Pleopeltis remigera</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis remigera, commonly known as the feather-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its host.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in its nocturnal pollination.</p>
