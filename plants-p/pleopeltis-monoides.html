<p>Pleopeltis monoides, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are typically broad and leathery. The leaves are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that often have a waxy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
