<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Puccinellia flahaultii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitats.</p>
