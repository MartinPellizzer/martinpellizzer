                    <h1>Perplexia frigida</h1>
<p>Perplexia frigida, commonly known as the Frostbloom, is a rare alpine plant found in high-altitude regions with cold climates.</p>
<p>It has silvery, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only during brief periods of thaw in early spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from rocky soil, and it relies on specific pollinators that are active during its short flowering period.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to temperature changes, Perplexia frigida is considered a indicator species for climate change.</p>
