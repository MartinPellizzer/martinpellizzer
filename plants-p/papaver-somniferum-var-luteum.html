<p>Papaver somniferum var. luteum, commonly known as the Turkish poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern Mediterranean and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain latex, which can be processed to extract alkaloids such as morphine and codeine. Its botanical features include showy, cup-shaped petals and a taproot system.</p>
<p>Due to its association with opium production, it is regulated in many countries.</p>
