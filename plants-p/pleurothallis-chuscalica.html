<p>Pleurothallis chuscalica, commonly known as the Chuscalica orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
