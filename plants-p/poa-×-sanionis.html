                    <h1>Poa × sanionis</h1>
<p>Poa × sanionis, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage, often forming dense, compact turf. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and is often found in lawns and pastures. It has small, spikelet-like inflorescences and produces wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
