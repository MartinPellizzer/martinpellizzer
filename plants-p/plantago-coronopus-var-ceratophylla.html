                    <h1>Plantago coronopus var. ceratophylla</h1>
<p>Plantago coronopus var. ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant is characterized by its rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. Its scientific name reflects its distinct horn-like structures on the leaves, which are a notable botanical feature.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other species in the Plantago genus, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits.</p>
