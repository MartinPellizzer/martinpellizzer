<p>Ptychosperma arecinum, commonly known as the African cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
