                    <h1>Populus euphratica</h1>
<p>Populus euphratica, commonly known as the Euphrates poplar, is a unique species of willow native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fibrous bark and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and can survive in saline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Populus euphratica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert species.</p>
