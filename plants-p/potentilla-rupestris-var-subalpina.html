                    <h1>Potentilla rupestris var. subalpina</h1>
<p>Potentilla rupestris var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens or alpine landscapes.</p>
