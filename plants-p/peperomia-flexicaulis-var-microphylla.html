<p>Peperomia flexicaulis var. microphylla, commonly known as the miniature peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are small and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and compact form make it ideal for container cultivation and tabletop displays.</p>
