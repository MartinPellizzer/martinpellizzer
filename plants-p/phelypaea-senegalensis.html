<p>Phelypaea senegalensis, commonly known as the African water fern, is a aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and rice fields. The plant has long, thin fronds that float on the water surface, with rhizomes that anchor it to the substrate. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
