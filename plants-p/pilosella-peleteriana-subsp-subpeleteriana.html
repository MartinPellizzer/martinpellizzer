<p>Pilosella peleteriana subsp.</p>
<p>subpeleteriana, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and flower morphology.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized flora of high-altitude environments.</p>
