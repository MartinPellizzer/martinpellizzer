<p>Parodia microsperma subsp.</p>
<p>catamarcensis, commonly known as the Catamarcensis Cactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to Argentina. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies.</p>
