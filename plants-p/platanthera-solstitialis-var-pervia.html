                    <h1>Platanthera solstitialis var. pervia</h1>
<p>Platanthera solstitialis var. pervia, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and moist meadows in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale violet to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, showy flower per stem. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
