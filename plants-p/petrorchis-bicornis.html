<p>Petrorchis bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble two horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with a distinctive lip.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Petrorchis bicornis is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
