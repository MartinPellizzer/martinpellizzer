                    <h1>Panax fulvus</h1>
<p>Panax fulvus, commonly known as the yellow ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species of the ginseng genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of China, where it thrives in cool, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its yellowish roots, which are distinct from the more commonly cultivated Panax ginseng. Its botanical features include a perennial herb with alternate, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique properties, Panax fulvus is of interest to botanists and traditional medicine practitioners alike.</p>
