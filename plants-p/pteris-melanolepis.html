<p>Pteris melanolepis, commonly known as the black-stem maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a contrasting reddish or brownish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
