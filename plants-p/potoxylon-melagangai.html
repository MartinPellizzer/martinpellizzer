                <h1>Potoxylon melagangai</h1>
<p>Potoxylon melagangai, commonly known as the red-tailed ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark bark and long, narrow leaves that help it conserve water in harsh conditions. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, spherical fruits. Its wood is extremely hard and durable, making it valuable for traditional and artisanal uses.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Potoxylon melagangai is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
