                    <h1>Penstemon humilis var. desereticus</h1>
<p>Penstemon humilis var. desereticus, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to lavender. The leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
