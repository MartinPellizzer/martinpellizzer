<p>Panicum obscurans, commonly known as dark panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Panicum obscurans is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
