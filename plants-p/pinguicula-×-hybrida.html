                    <h1>Pinguicula × hybrida</h1>
<p>Pinguicula × hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid butterwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects, providing it with essential nutrients. This hybrid species typically exhibits a range of leaf shapes and colors, depending on the parent species involved in its hybridization. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet meadows, where it can efficiently capture prey.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its adaptability and the unique morphology resulting from its hybrid origin.</p>
