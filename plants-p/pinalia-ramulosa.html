<p>Pinalia ramulosa, commonly known as the feathered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish.</p>
<p>Pinalia ramulosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
