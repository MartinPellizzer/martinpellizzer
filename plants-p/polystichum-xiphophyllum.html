<p>Polystichum xiphophyllum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive white or silvery margin. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
