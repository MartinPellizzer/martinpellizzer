                    <h1>Plagiogyria assurgens</h1>
<p>Plagiogyria assurgens, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a foliose lichen that typically grows on bark and wood in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive greenish to yellowish thallus with a leathery texture and is often covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a symbiotic association between algae and fungi. It is widely distributed in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
