                    <h1>Pentadynamis</h1>
<p>Pentadynamis, commonly known as the five-lobed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring five sepals and petals that often form a showy, symmetrical bloom. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Pentadynamis species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Their flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and they play a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
