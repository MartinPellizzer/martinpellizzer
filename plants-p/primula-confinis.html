                    <h1>Primula confinis</h1>
<p>Primula confinis, commonly known as the mountain primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a distinctive yellow throat. Its leaves are broadly ovate and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Primula confinis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment.</p>
