<p>Poa navashinii, commonly known as Navashin's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Poa navashinii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
