                    <h1>Paepalanthus convexus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus convexus, commonly known as the cup-like cactus, is a unique species native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stem that resembles a cup or bowl, which is adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus convexus is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting a slow growth rate.</p>
