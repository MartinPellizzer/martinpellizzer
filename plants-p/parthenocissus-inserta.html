                    <h1>Parthenocissus inserta</h1>
<p>Parthenocissus inserta, commonly known as the Virginia creeper, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features palmately lobed leaves that turn bright red in the fall, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its tendrils allow it to climb and spread along walls, fences, and trees.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant can be toxic if ingested.</p>
