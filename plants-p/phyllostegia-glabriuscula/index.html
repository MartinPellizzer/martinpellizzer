<p>Mexican mint, scientifically known as Phyllostegia glabriuscula, is a unique and aromatic plant native to the southeastern United States. This member of the mint family is often mistaken for a true mint due to its refreshing scent and similar appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Despite its name, it is not closely related to the traditional mints of the genus Mentha. Its delicate leaves and clusters of small white flowers make it a desirable addition to gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
