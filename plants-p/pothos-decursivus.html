                    <h1>Pothos decursivus</h1>
<p>Pothos decursivus, commonly known as the creeping pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its fruit. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Pothos decursivus is also known for its ability to purify the air and is often used in interior design to enhance both aesthetics and air quality.</p>
