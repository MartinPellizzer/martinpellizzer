                    <h1>Pericampylus membranaceus</h1>
<p>Pericampylus membranaceus, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a delicate and unique fern species characterized by its thin, membranous fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant's fronds are typically arching and have a distinctive, almost papery texture, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
