<p>Polypodium vulgare var. acuminatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
