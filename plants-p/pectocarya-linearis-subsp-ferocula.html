<p>Pectocarya linearis subsp.</p>
<p>ferocula, commonly known as the linear pectocarya, is a species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary response to drought and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations in arid environments.</p>
