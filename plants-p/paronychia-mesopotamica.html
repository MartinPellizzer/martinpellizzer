                    <h1>Paronychia mesopotamica</h1>
<p>Paronychia mesopotamica, commonly known as the Mesopotamian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert margins and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
