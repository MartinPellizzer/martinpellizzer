                    <h1>Phyllota phylicoides var. comosa</h1>
<p>Phyllota phylicoides var. comosa, commonly known as the woolly phyllota, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
