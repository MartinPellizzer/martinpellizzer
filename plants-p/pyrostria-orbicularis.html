                    <h1>Pyrostria orbicularis</h1>
<p>Pyrostria orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrostria orbicularis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
