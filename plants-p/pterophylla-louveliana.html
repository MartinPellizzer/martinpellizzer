                    <h1>Pterophylla louveliana</h1>
<p>Pterophylla louveliana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Pterophylla louveliana is often found in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
