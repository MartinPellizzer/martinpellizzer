<p>Pterostylis russellii, commonly known as Russell's duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, often strikingly shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually green or yellowish with a distinctive duck-like appearance, which is why it is named after the bird.</p>
<p>The orchid has a short, erect stem with a single or few flowers, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
