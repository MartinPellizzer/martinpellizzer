                    <h1>Phrynium bisubulatum</h1>
<p>Phrynium bisubulatum, commonly known as the swamp arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in wetland environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, followed by red or purple berries containing angular seeds. It thrives in marshy or flooded soils and is often found in swampy areas near rivers or coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens or as a decorative plant in humid climates.</p>
