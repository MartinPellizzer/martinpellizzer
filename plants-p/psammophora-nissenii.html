                    <h1>Psammophora nissenii</h1>
<p>Psammophora nissenii, commonly known as the desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and rocky environments, particularly in desert regions where it forms a crust-like structure on soil surfaces. The plant's ability to survive extreme drought conditions is due to its efficient water retention and photosynthetic capabilities. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Its simple yet resilient structure makes it an important indicator of environmental conditions in desert ecosystems.</p>
