                    <h1>Phoradendron flavens</h1>
<p>Phoradendron flavens, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the tropics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Phoradendron flavens plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing both plant and animal communities.</p>
