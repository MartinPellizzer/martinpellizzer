                    <h1>Patagonium torcaeum</h1>
<p>Patagonium torcaeum, commonly known as the Andean rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Patagonium torcaeum is adapted to cold temperatures and can thrive at high altitudes where few other plants can survive.</p>
