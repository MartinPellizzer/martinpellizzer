                    <h1>Patzkea</h1>
<p>Patzkea, commonly known as the "butterfly orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their delicate, butterfly-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, white, and purple. Patzkea species typically grow as epiphytes, meaning they attach themselves to other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Their leaves are usually broad and革质 (leathery), and they thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
