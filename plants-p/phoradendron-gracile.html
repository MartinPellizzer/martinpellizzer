                    <h1>Phoradendron gracile</h1>
<p>Phoradendron gracile, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some photosynthetic support through its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its growth is often restricted to specific regions, such as parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
