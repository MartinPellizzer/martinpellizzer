                    <h1>Picea koraiensis var. tonaiensis</h1>
<p>Picea koraiensis var. tonaiensis, commonly known as the Tonai fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a single row along the shoots. The tree produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
