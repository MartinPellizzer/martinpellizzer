<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Its morphology includes a short, stout stem with whorled leaves, and it often forms dense mats on the forest floor.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus tournayanus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
