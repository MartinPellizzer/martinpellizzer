<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically glandular and sticky to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, winged fruits. Its sticky leaves and unique morphology make it easily identifiable in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Ptelea viscosa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
