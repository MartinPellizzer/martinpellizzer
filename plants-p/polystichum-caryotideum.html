                    <h1>Polystichum caryotideum</h1>
<p>Polystichum caryotideum, commonly known as the broadleaf woodfern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, and often dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
