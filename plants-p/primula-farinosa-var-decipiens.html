                    <h1>Primula farinosa var. decipiens</h1>
<p>Primula farinosa var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique floral morphology, it is sometimes referred to as a "deceptive" species, as its flowers may mimic the appearance of other plants to attract pollinators.</p>
