                    <h1>Pinus longaeva</h1>
<p>Pinus longaeva, commonly known as the Great Basin bristlecone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is renowned for being one of the oldest living organisms on Earth, with some individuals exceeding 5,000 years in age. This species thrives in high-altitude, arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in poor soils. Its slow growth rate contributes to its exceptional longevity and dense, resinous wood.</p>
<p>The tree's botanical characteristics include needle-like leaves, cones, and a distinctive branching pattern adapted to harsh mountain climates.</p>
