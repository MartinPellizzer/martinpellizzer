<p>Pleuridium palmatum, commonly known as the palmate pleuridium, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are palmately divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Pleuridium palmatum make it a valuable species for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
