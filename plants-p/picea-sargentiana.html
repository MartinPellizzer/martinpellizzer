                    <h1>Picea sargentiana</h1>
<p>Picea sargentiana, commonly known as Sargent's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a flat spruce-like pattern. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
