                    <h1>Planarium</h1>
<p>Planarium, commonly known as the flatworm, is not a plant but a type of simple invertebrate.</p>
<p>It belongs to the phylum Platyhelminthes and is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like body. Planaria are typically found in moist environments such as soil or freshwater habitats. They lack true organs and have a simple nervous system with a brain-like structure.</p>
<p>These organisms are often used in biological research due to their regenerative abilities and ease of cultivation.</p>
