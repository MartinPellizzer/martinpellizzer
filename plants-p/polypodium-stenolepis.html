                    <h1>Polypodium stenolepis</h1>
<p>Polypodium stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in forested areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
