                    <h1>Pyrethrum alpinum</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum alpinum, commonly known as alpine pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its natural insect-repelling properties. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Pyrethrum alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in natural pest control.</p>
