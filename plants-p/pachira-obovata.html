<p>Pachira obovata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of yellow, pendant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pachira obovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments.</p>
