                    <h1>Primula tschuktschorum var. beringensis</h1>
<p>Primula tschuktschorum var. beringensis, commonly known as the Bering Primrose, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broadly ovate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to extreme environments and its role in pollination by early-season insects.</p>
