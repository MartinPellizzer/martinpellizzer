                    <h1>Platystele delhierroi</h1>
<p>Platystele delhierroi, commonly known as the Delhierroi marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its small, tuberous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of tiny, white to pale green flowers, which are typically clustered in a dense inflorescence. Native to the humid, shaded understories of tropical rainforests in South America, it thrives in high moisture and cool temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
