<p>Polystichum molle, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum molle is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
