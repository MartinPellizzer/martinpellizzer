                    <h1>Polypodium lineare var. loriforme</h1>
<p>Polypodium lineare var. loriforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common polypody.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical *Polypodium lineare*. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with pinnae that are often slightly lobed or notched.</p>
<p>The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the pinnae and are covered by a thin, membranous indusium.</p>
