<p>Polypodium amoenum var. duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and produce numerous small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
