<p>Paepalanthus tatei, commonly known as the Tate's cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the cactus family, Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in parts of Argentina and Chile. This plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom during the warmer months and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus tatei is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
