<p>Protea baurii, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble a cluster of individual flowers, though they are actually a single floral unit called a capitulum. The plant features a tall, woody stem with large, leathery, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Native to the Western Cape region, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Protea baurii is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also an important species in the conservation of South Africa's unique flora.</p>
