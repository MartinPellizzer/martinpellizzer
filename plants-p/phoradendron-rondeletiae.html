                    <h1>Phoradendron rondeletiae</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rondeletiae, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its flowering and fruiting periods vary depending on the region, but it often blooms in the late winter or early spring.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting various bird species that rely on its berries for food.</p>
