                    <h1>Platystele catiensis</h1>
<p>Platystele catiensis, commonly known as the Catie's ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial bromeliad that produces a single, ephemeral flower, which opens only briefly before withering. The plant is characterized by its slender, leafless stem and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. Native to the cloud forests of central China, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Platystele catiensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
