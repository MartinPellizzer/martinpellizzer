                    <h1>Poinciana hirsuta</h1>
<p>Poinciana hirsuta, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bright red or orange-pink bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by long, slender seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Poinciana hirsuta is often cultivated for its striking appearance and is popular in ornamental gardening.</p>
