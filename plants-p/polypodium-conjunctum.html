<p>Polypodium conjunctum, commonly known as the clustered fern, is a tropical fern species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a clustered pattern. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both roots and new shoots. Its spores are released from small, round sorus structures located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium conjunctum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests.</p>
