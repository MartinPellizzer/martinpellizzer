                    <h1>Plantago littoralis</h1>
<p>Plantago littoralis, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
