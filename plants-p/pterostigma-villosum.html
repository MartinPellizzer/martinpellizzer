                    <h1>Pterostigma villosum</h1>
<p>Pterostigma villosum, commonly known as the hairy pterostigma, is a rare species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaf margins. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, red berries. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant diversity and adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pterostigma villosum is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
