                            <h1>Pleurospermum Delavayi</h1>
<p>Delavay's pleurospermum, scientifically known as Pleurospermum delavayi, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the mountainous regions of western China. This flowering plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical treasure for future generations.</p>
