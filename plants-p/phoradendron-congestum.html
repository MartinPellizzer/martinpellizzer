                    <h1>Phoradendron congestum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron congestum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected off the host. The plant's berries are often consumed by birds, which then spread its seeds to other trees, facilitating its propagation. Its sticky seeds adhere to the bark of host trees, where they germinate and establish a new parasitic connection.</p>
<p>This unique ecological relationship makes it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
