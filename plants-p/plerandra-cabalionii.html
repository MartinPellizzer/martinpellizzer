<p>Plerandra cabalionii, commonly known as the Kauri orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the subtropical rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in association with other rainforest flora. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a spike.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plerandra cabalionii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
