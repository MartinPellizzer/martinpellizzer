                    <h1>Peltopus intersitus</h1>
<p>Peltopus intersitus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense, white, velvety coating. Its flowers are pale green with intricate patterns, and they bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural pollinators, Peltopus intersitus is critically endangered and requires specialized conservation efforts.</p>
