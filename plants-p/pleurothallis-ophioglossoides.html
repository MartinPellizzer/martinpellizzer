<p>Pleurothallis ophioglossoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and striking, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it has a delicate, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
