                    <h1>Poinciana elata</h1>
<p>Poinciana elata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange bracts that resemble flames, which appear in clusters during the flowering season. The plant has a dense, rounded canopy and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in warm, humid climates and is well-suited for coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray.</p>
