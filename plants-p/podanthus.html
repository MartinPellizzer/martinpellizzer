<p>Podanthus, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its attractive, often silver or gray-green foliage. The leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Podanthus species produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, often arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>These plants are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid environments.</p>
