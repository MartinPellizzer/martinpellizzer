<p>Pyrrorhiza neblinae, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant typically grows on mossy tree trunks or rocks, thriving in high humidity and cool temperatures. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, a feature adapted to its misty habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
