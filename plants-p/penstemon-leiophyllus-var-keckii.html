<p>Penstemon leiophyllus var. keckii, commonly known as Keck's smooth beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces spikes of tubular, pink to purple flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to ecological biodiversity.</p>
