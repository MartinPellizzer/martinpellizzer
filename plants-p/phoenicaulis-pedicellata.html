<p>Phoenicaulis pedicellata, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces upright flowering stems that bear clusters of pinkish-purple, spurred orchid flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
