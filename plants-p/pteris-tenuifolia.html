                    <h1>Pteris tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Pteris tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris tenuifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>
