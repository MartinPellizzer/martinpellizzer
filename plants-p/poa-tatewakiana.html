<p>Poa tatewakiana, commonly known as the Stewart's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and tufted growth habit, typically forming dense, mat-like vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and montane environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Poa tatewakiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates in its native range.</p>
