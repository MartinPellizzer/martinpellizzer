<p>Pyrrhocactus nigricans, commonly known as the black spurge cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warm season, which are followed by bead-like fruits containing seeds. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent structure and minimal leaf surface.</p>
<p>Pyrrhocactus nigricans is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
