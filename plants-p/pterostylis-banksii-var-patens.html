                    <h1>Pterostylis banksii var. patens</h1>
<p>Pterostylis banksii var. patens, commonly known as the Patens Spider Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, greenish-brown flowers that resemble spiders, a feature typical of many orchids in the genus Pterostylis. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with a single flower, which is pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as rainforests and understoreys, often growing on the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
