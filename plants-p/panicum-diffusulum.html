                    <h1>Panicum diffusulum</h1>
<p>Panicum diffusulum, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant has thin, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
