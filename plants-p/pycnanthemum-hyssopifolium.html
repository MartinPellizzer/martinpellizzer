<p>Pycnanthemum hyssopifolium, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands or wetlands, and it has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively. It is often found in prairie and swamp habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity.</p>
<p>The leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinct, mint-like fragrance when crushed.</p>
