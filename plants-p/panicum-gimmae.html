<p>Panicum gimmae, commonly known as the Gimmah Panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, Panicum gimmae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
