<p>Psammisia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flower sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that hang from the stems, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Psammisia penduliflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
