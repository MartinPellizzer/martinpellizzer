                    <h1>Phoradendron aurato-ochraceum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron aurato-ochraceum, commonly known as the golden-ochre mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the neotropical region.</p>
<p>It possesses a dense, leafy crown with small, elliptical leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing sticky seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also contributing to ecological interactions through seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
