                    <h1>Pinus densiflora var. oculus-draconis-pendula</h1>
<p>Pinus densiflora var. oculus-draconis-pendula, commonly known as the Dragon's Eye Weeping Pine, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Japanese black pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and dramatic appearance. The tree produces small, pine cone-like structures that are typically green and remain on the tree for several years before maturing. Its foliage consists of dark green, needle-like leaves that are dense and provide a lush, evergreen canopy.</p>
<p>This variant is highly valued in horticulture for its unique form and is often cultivated in specialized gardens and landscapes.</p>
