                    <h1>Pugetia</h1>
<p>Pugetia, commonly known as the Pacific coast lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments along the western coast of North America. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its partnership with photosynthetic organisms for nourishment. Pugetia plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an indicator of environmental health and stability.</p>
