<p>Potamogeton sturrockii, commonly known as Sturrock's pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, yellow flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving streams, where it can form dense underwater vegetation. Its roots help stabilize sediments, contributing to water clarity and habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Sturrock's pondweed is an important component of New Zealand's freshwater ecosystems.</p>
