<p>Pennisetum reversum, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and its showy, plume-like inflorescences that turn a striking purple hue in the fall. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a decorative and potentially invasive species.</p>
<p>Pennisetum reversum is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a habitat for pollinators.</p>
