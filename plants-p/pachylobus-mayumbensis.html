                    <h1>Pachylobus mayumbensis</h1>
<p>Pachylobus mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumb√© forest fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the dense rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in the undergrowth of primary forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival.</p>
