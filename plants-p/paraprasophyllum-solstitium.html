                    <h1>Paraprasophyllum solstitium</h1>
<p>Paraprasophyllum solstitium, commonly known as the summer solstice lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species that thrives in specific microhabitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique combination of fungal and algal components, which contribute to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant exhibits a crustose growth form, adhering tightly to rock surfaces, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its chemical composition includes secondary metabolites that provide protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
