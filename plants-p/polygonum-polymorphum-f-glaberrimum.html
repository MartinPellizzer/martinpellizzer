<p>Polygonum polymorphum f. glaberrimum, commonly known as the smoothleaf smartweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other forms of Polygonum polymorphum. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats.</p>
