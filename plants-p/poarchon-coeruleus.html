                    <h1>Poarchon coeruleus</h1>
<p>Poarchon coeruleus, commonly known as the sky-blue orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant blue petals and a distinctive white lip, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period typically occurs during the late spring and early summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Poarchon coeruleus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
