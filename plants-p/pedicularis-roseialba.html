                    <h1>Pedicularis roseialba</h1>
<p>Pedicularis roseialba, commonly known as the white monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum, which attracts pollinators like bees and flies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
