                    <h1>Pimenta intermedia</h1>
<p>Pimenta intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of bright red berries. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and invasive potential have led to its classification as a noxious weed in several regions.</p>
