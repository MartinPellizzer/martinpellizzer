<p>Polypodium crenatum, commonly known as the serrated huperzia, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic fern, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium crenatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
