<p>Poa articulata, commonly known as the bentgrass or articulated bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that contain the flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Poa articulata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
