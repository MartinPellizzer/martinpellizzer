                    <h1>Potentilla × mulleri</h1>
<p>Potentilla × mulleri, commonly known as the silver leaf potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight effectively. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact form, drought tolerance, and ability to thrive in full sun.</p>
