                    <h1>Pinus mugo var. typica</h1>
<p>Pinus mugo var. typica, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slow growth, dense foliage, and twisted, gnarled form, which makes it well adapted to harsh mountain environments. The tree typically reaches a height of only 1 to 2 meters, with short, stout branches and needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in clusters. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly hardy, capable of surviving in poor soil and extreme weather conditions.</p>
