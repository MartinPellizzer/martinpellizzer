<p>Pinguicula pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and usually white or pink, appearing on slender stems above the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>Pinguicula pygmaea is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients.</p>
