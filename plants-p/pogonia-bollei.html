                    <h1>Pogonia bollei</h1>
<p>Pogonia bollei, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid pink and white petals, with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a specialized structure for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests and wetlands. It has a short flowering period in late spring, producing delicate, fragrant blooms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pogonia bollei is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
