<p>Polygonum vestitum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot hogweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
