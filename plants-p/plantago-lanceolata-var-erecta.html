                    <h1>Plantago lanceolata var. erecta</h1>
<p>Plantago lanceolata var. erecta, commonly known as erect plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to the standard Plantago lanceolata.</p>
