<p>Polygala comosa subsp.</p>
<p>pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, branched stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
