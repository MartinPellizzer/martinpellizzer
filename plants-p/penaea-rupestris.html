                    <h1>Penaea rupestris</h1>
<p>Penaea rupestris, commonly known as the rock penaea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature essential for survival in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Penaea rupestris thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it a notable species in its native ecosystem.</p>
