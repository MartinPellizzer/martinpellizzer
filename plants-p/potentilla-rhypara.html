                    <h1>Potentilla rhypara</h1>
<p>Potentilla rhypara, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10â€“30 centimeters. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Potentilla rhypara is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions.</p>
