                    <h1>Poa epileuca</h1>
<p>Poa epileuca, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense mats in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in nutrient-rich soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates, it is valued in conservation and restoration projects.</p>
