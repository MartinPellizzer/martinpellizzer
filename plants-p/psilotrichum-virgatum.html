                    <h1>Psilotrichum virgatum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum virgatum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in North America, it thrives in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
