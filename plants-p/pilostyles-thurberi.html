                    <h1>Pilostyles thurberi</h1>
<p>Pilostyles thurberi, commonly known as the Thurber's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its highly reduced floral structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it parasitizes various species of grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
