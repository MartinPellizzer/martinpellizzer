                    <h1>Polypodium vulgare var. semilacerum</h1>
<p>Polypodium vulgare var. semilacerum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is often distinguished by its shorter, more slender fronds compared to other polypodium species.</p>
