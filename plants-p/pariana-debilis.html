<p>Pariana debilis, commonly known as the slender pariana, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Pariana debilis thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats.</p>
