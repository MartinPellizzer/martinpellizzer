                    <h1>Panicum microlemma</h1>
<p>Panicum microlemma, commonly known as little barley or dwarf barnyard grass, is a grass species native to Africa and widely naturalized in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual plant with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are minute and dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its reduced lemma structure, which gives it the specific epithet "microlemma.".</p>
