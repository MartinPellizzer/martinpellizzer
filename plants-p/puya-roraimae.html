                    <h1>Puya roraimae</h1>
<p>Puya roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima grass or the Angel's Tears, is a striking plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted clusters of long, narrow leaves that form a dense mat on the rocky soil. The plant produces tall, spire-like inflorescences bearing small, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in the nutrient-poor, humid conditions of the high-altitude grasslands.</p>
<p>Puya roraimae is a symbol of the unique flora found in the tepuis, adapted to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
