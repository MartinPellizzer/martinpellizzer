                    <h1>Parnassia lanceolata var. oblongipetala</h1>
<p>Parnassia lanceolata var. oblongipetala, commonly known as the broad-petaled parnassia, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features striking white, petal-like bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant has a short, stout stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically clustered in a umbel-like arrangement and produce small, yellowish ovaries.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader petals compared to the typical form of Parnassia lanceolata.</p>
