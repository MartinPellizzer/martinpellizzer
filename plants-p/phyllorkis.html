<p>Phyllorkis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. Phyllorkis species typically grow in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They have rhizomatous growth habits and produce sporangia on the undersides of their leaves.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with unique leaf morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
