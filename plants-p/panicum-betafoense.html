<p>Panicum betafoense, commonly known as the Betafoense Panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
