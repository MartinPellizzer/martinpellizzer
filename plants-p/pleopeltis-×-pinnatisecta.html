                    <h1>Pleopeltis × pinnatisecta</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis × pinnatisecta, commonly known as the hybrid tree fern, is a natural hybrid between Pleopeltis polypodioides and Pleopeltis pinnatisecta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinct midrib and lance-shaped pinnae. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest in plant hybridization studies.</p>
