<p>Phleum tzvelevii, commonly known as Tzvelev's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
