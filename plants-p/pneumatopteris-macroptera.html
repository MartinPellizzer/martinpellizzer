<p>Pneumatopteris macroptera, commonly known as the giant horse tail, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, segmented stems that resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
