                    <h1>Perama galioides var. hispida</h1>
<p>Perama galioides var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid marsh onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
