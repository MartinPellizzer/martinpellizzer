                    <h1>Physematium euporolepis</h1>
<p>Physematium euporolepis, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and striking epiphytic fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, star-shaped fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green basal leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservatories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
