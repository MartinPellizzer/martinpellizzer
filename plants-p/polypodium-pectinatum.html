                    <h1>Polypodium pectinatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium pectinatum, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender, cinnamon-brown fertile fronds that emerge from a dense, dark green, club-shaped crown of sterile fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The fern's unique appearance and ecological role make it a valuable component of forest ecosystems.</p>
