<p>Physalis virginiana var. hispida, commonly known as the rough globeberry, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bright orange, lantern-shaped fruits that enclose its small, edible berries. These fruits are often used in culinary applications, though the berries themselves are typically tart and less commonly consumed.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
