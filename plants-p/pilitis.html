<p>Pilitis, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, swampy soils.</p>
<p>Pilitis plays an important ecological role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
