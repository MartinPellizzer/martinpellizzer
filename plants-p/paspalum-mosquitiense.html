<p>Paspalum mosquitiense, commonly known as mosquito grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and swampy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
