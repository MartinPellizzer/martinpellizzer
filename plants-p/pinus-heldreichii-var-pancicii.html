                    <h1>Pinus heldreichii var. pancicii</h1>
<p>Pinus heldreichii var. pancicii, commonly known as the Balkan pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of other pine species. The tree produces cones that are usually pendulous, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
