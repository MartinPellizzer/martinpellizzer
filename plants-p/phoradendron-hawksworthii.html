                    <h1>Phoradendron hawksworthii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron hawksworthii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of native trees, such as the koa, and derives some of its nutrients from its host. Its berries, which are edible for some bird species, play a role in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is a symbol of the unique flora of Hawaii.</p>
