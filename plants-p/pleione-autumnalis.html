                    <h1>Pleione autumnalis</h1>
<p>Pleione autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn pleione, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the fall, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant features a pseudobulb-like structure and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it conserve moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, often growing in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
