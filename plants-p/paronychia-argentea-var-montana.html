<p>Paronychia argentea var. montana, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its foliage is adapted to arid conditions, with a thick, waxy cuticle that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats such as grasslands and desert margins.</p>
