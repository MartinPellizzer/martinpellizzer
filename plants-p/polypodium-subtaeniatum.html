<p>Polypodium subtaeniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate.</p>
<p>Polypodium subtaeniatum reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
