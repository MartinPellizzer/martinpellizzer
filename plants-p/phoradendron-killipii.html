                    <h1>Phoradendron killipii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron killipii, commonly known as the Killip's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a root system that attaches to the host tree, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients while also drawing some of its own sustenance from the host.</p>
