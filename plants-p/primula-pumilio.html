<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
