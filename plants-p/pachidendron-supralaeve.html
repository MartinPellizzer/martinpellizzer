<p>Pachidendron supralaeve, commonly known as the smooth-leafed pachidendron, is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and epiphytic growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically exhibits a shrub-like form with elongated, smooth leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous tiny seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and diversity.</p>
