                    <h1>Poa alpina var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil in alpine environments and serving as forage for grazing animals.</p>
