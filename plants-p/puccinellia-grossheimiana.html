                    <h1>Puccinellia grossheimiana</h1>
<p>Puccinellia grossheimiana, commonly known as the desert grass or sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or coastal dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Puccinellia grossheimiana plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
