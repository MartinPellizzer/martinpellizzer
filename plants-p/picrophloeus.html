                    <h1>Picrophloeus</h1>
<p>Picrophloeus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations for survival in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Picrophloeus is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
