<p>Ponerorchis keiskei, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers with a delicate, almost translucent appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
