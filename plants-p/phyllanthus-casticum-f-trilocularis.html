<p>Phyllanthus casticum f. trilocularis, commonly known as the three-chambered boxthorn, is a variant of the boxthorn plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruit that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for erosion control in suitable climates.</p>
