                    <h1>Pteris lomariacea var. digitatopalmata</h1>
<p>Pteris lomariacea var. digitatopalmata, commonly known as the digitate palm fern, is a variant of the common water fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are pinnately divided with a distinctive digitate (finger-like) appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are often glossy and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens.</p>
