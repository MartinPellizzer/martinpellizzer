<p>Pitcairnia albucifolia, commonly known as the white-veined pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous white to pale pink flowers, which are typically showy and long-lasting. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing epiphytically on trees in the cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
