<p>Polygala calcarea, commonly known as the limestone milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on rocky or limestone outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Polygala calcarea is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties and is also an important species for pollinators in its native habitats.</p>
