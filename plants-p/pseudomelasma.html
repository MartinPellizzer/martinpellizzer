                    <h1>Pseudomelasma</h1>
<p>Pseudomelasma, commonly known as false melasma, is a non-cancerous, benign skin growth that appears as a flat, discolored lesion on the skin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by a dark brown or black pigmentation due to the accumulation of melanin in the epidermis. This condition is often mistaken for melasma but lacks the irregular, patchy distribution typical of the latter. Pseudomelasma typically occurs on sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, and hands.</p>
<p>It is primarily caused by chronic sun exposure and is more common in older adults.</p>
