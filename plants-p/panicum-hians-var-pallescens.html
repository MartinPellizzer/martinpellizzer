<p>Panicum hians var. pallescens, commonly known as silver panicum, is a variant of the panic grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of pale green to silver bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers.</p>
