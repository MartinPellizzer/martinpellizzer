                    <h1>Pseudocalymma sagotii</h1>
<p>Pseudocalymma sagotii, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the coastal regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale pink or white petals and sepals. The plant typically grows on limestone outcrops and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native region.</p>
