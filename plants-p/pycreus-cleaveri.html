<p>Pycreus cleaveri, commonly known as the cleaver orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Pycreus cleaveri is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and damp meadows.</p>
