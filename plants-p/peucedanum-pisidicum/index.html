                            <h1>Peucedanum Pisidicum</h1>
<p>Peucedanum pisidicum is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family, native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. This plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Despite its beauty, it remains largely overlooked in botanical studies and conservation efforts. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a vulnerable species in the face of environmental change. Understanding and protecting Peucedanum pisidicum is crucial for preserving biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
