<p>Pleopeltis bampsii, commonly known as the Bamps' rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
