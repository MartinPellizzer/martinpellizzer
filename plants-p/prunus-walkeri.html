                <h1>Prunus walkeri</h1>
<p>Prunus walkeri, commonly known as the desert peach, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to peaches but are typically less sweet and more tart. Prunus walkeri is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky soils and desert environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural interest in drought-resistant plants.</p>
