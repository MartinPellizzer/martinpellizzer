<p>Potentilla gelida subsp.</p>
<p>boreoasiatica, commonly known as the Asian alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in alpine and subarctic environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain.</p>
