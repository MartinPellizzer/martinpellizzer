                    <h1>Potentilla naspata</h1>
<p>Potentilla naspata, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in suitable conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Potentilla naspata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
