<p>Psidium rigidum, commonly known as the rough guava, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits that are typically smaller than those of common guavas. Its fruit is valued for its aromatic flavor and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Psidium rigidum thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
