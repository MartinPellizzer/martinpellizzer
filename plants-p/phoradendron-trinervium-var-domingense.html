                    <h1>Phoradendron trinervium var. domingense</h1>
<p>Phoradendron trinervium var. domingense, commonly known as the Dominican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This species is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Dominican Republic and other parts of the Greater Antilles.</p>
