                            <h1>Pteronia Camphorata Var. Aspera</h1>
<p>Pteronia camphorata var. aspera is a striking plant native to southern Africa known for its unique appearance and aromatic properties. It features narrow, gray-green leaves with a distinctive rough texture that gives it its common name. This variety is closely related to the widely cultivated Pteronia camphorata but has its own distinct characteristics. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its fragrant foliage and resilience make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes.</p>
