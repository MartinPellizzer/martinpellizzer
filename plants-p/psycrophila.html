                    <h1>Psycrophila</h1>
<p>Psycrophila, commonly known as the cold-loving plant, is a genus of flowering plants that thrives in temperate and subarctic climates.</p>
<p>These plants typically have small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in cooler environments. They often produce clusters of small, white or pale-colored flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Psycrophila species are usually found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in shaded forest areas.</p>
<p>Their ability to withstand low temperatures makes them an important part of alpine and boreal ecosystems.</p>
