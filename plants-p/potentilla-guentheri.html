                    <h1>Potentilla guentheri</h1>
<p>Potentilla guentheri, commonly known as Guenther's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, dark green leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
