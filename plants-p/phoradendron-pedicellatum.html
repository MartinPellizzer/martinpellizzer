                    <h1>Phoradendron pedicellatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron pedicellatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are evergreen and remain on the plant throughout the year.</p>
<p>Phoradendron pedicellatum plays a significant ecological role by supporting diverse wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
