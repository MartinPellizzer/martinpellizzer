<p>Pteridium aquilinum subsp.</p>
<p>capense, commonly known as the Cape bracken, is a fern species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, rocky outcrops, and forest margins. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
