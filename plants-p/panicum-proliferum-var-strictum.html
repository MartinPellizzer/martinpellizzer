<p>Panicum proliferum var. strictum, commonly known as rigid panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, fluffy seed heads that are often tinged with red or purple, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats, it is also used for erosion control in suitable environments.</p>
