<p>Populus × canadensis f. marilandica, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a hybrid poplar species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark, which becomes smoother as the tree matures. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough, serrated margin. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>This species is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils.</p>
