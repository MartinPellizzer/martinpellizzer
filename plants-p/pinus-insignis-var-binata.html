                    <h1>Pinus insignis var. binata</h1>
<p>Pinus insignis var. binata, commonly known as the two-colored pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Mexican pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique binate foliage, where the needles are arranged in two different colors on the same branchâ€”typically a lighter and darker green. This color variation is due to differences in chlorophyll concentration and is most noticeable during the growing season. The tree is native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico and thrives in high-altitude, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
