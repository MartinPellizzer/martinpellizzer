                    <h1>Pinguicula gelida</h1>
<p>Pinguicula gelida, commonly known as the ice bladder, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Pinguicula gelida is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous behavior make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
