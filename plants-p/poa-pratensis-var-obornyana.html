                    <h1>Poa pratensis var. obornyana</h1>
<p>Poa pratensis var. obornyana, commonly known as the alpine meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass.</p>
<p>It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, thriving in cool, temperate climates. This plant is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted growth habit, which allows it to form lush, carpet-like lawns. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
