                    <h1>Protolirion sakuraii</h1>
<p>Protolirion sakuraii, commonly known as the Sakurai's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to capture moisture from the humid air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Protolirion sakuraii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
