<p>Polypodium assurgens, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb on rocks and trees. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium assurgens is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops.</p>
