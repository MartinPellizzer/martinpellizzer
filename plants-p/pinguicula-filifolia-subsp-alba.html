<p>Pinguicula filifolia subsp.</p>
<p>alba, commonly known as the white-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne on a slender stalk. It thrives in moist, boggy environments and requires high humidity to maintain its carnivorous adaptations.</p>
<p>Its specialized leaves not only capture prey but also aid in water retention, making it well-suited to its wetland habitat.</p>
