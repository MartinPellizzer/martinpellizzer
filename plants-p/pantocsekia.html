                    <h1>Pantocsekia</h1>
<p>Pantocsekia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has thin, leathery leaves and relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rarity, Pantocsekia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
