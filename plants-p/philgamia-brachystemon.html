                    <h1>Philgamia brachystemon</h1>
<p>Philgamia brachystemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans.</p>
<p>Philgamia brachystemon is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid conditions.</p>
