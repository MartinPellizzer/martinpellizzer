<p>Polypodium xalapense, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps it absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>Polypodium xalapense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
