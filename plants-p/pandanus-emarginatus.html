<p>Pandanus emarginatus, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that eventually develop into edible fruits, which are consumed by both humans and animals. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species for erosion control.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems.</p>
