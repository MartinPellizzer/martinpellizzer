                    <h1>Puccinellia andersonii</h1>
<p>Puccinellia andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dunes, and plays a role in stabilizing soil in these environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of desert and sagebrush ecosystems.</p>
