<p>Polygonum volcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic knotweed, is a perennial herb native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features upright stems covered in small, sticky hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Polygonum volcanicum is known for its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed or volcanic soil quickly.</p>
