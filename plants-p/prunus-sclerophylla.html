<p>Prunus sclerophylla, commonly known as the coast almond, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub with dense, leathery leaves that are adapted to the dry, salty air of its coastal habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, almond-like fruits. Prunus sclerophylla is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for harsh coastal conditions and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
