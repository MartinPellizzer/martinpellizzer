                    <h1>Pleurosorus hispanicus</h1>
<p>Pleurosorus hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and covered with a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common to many ferns.</p>
<p>Pleurosorus hispanicus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small invertebrates.</p>
