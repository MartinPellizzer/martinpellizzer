<p>Packera insulae-regalis, commonly known as the island crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh coastal environments of its range. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid microhabitats.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
