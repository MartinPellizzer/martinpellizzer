<p>Phelypaea reuteriana, commonly known as the Reuter's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form a network that helps anchor it to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle.</p>
