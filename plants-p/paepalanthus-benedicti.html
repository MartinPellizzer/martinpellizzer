                    <h1>Paepalanthus benedicti</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus benedicti, commonly known as the Benedict's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a dense covering of spines and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems.</p>
