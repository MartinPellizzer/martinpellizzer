<p>Polypodium heracleum, commonly known as the wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a dense network of roots that help anchor it in soil.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
