                            <h1>Pecteilis Medioflexa</h1>
<p>Common evening primrose, scientifically known as Pecteilis medioflexa, is a striking flowering plant native to the western United States. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its most notable feature is its vivid orange-yellow blooms that open at dusk, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant is also valued for its resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. With its unique blooming pattern and ecological importance, Pecteilis medioflexa plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and biodiversity.</p>
