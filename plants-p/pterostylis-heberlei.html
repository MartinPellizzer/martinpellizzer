                    <h1>Pterostylis heberlei</h1>
<p>Pterostylis heberlei, commonly known as the Heberlei ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a slender, leafless stem that supports its single or few flowers. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Pterostylis heberlei is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
