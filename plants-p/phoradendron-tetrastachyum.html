                    <h1>Phoradendron tetrastachyum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tetrastachyum, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often red, which contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
