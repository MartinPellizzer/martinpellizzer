                    <h1>Polypodium unitum</h1>
<p>Polypodium unitum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
