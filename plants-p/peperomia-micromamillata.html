                    <h1>Peperomia micromamillata</h1>
<p>Peperomia micromamillata, commonly known as the dwarf mamillate peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
