<p>Petradoria pumila subsp.</p>
<p>graminea, commonly known as the slender petradoria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in mountainous regions.</p>
