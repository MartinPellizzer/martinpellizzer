<p>Pleurocarpaea gracilis, commonly known as the slender pleurocarp, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the moist forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by local wildlife. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
