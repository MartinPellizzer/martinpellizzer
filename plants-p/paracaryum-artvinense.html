                    <h1>Paracaryum artvinense</h1>
<p>Paracaryum artvinense, commonly known as the Artvin cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the region of Artvin in northeastern Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, providing insights into the evolutionary history of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activities.</p>
