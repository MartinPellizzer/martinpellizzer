<p>Polypodium megasorum, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
