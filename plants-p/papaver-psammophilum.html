<p>Papaver psammophilum, commonly known as the sandhill poppy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in dry, hot environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
