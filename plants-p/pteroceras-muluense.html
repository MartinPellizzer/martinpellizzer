                    <h1>Pteroceras muluense</h1>
<p>Pteroceras muluense, commonly known as the Mulu horned fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its unique, horn-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the canopy of dense forests. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, segmented appearance, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteroceras muluense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
