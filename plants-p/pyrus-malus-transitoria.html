                    <h1>Pyrus malus transitoria</h1>
<p>Pyrus malus transitoria, commonly known as the transient apple, is a rare species of crabapple native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, tart apples that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
