                    <h1>Potentilla tenella</h1>
<p>Potentilla tenella, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a hairy texture and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>Potentilla tenella is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize slopes in challenging environments.</p>
