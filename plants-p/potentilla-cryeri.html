                    <h1>Potentilla cryeri</h1>
<p>Potentilla cryeri, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla cryeri is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas, where it contributes to the unique flora of these ecosystems.</p>
