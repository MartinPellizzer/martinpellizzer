                    <h1>Pyrus malus pleniflora</h1>
<p>Pyrus malus pleniflora, commonly known as the full-flowered apple tree, is a cultivar of the apple tree known for its abundant flowering.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of small, white blossoms that cover the tree in early spring, making it a visually striking ornamental plant. The plant is native to temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its fruit, while edible, is typically smaller and less flavorful compared to standard apple varieties.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often grown for its aesthetic value rather than for commercial fruit production.</p>
