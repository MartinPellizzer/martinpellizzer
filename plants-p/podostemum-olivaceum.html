<p>Podostemum olivaceum, commonly known as the olive river-mallow, is a unique aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically found near the water's surface. Podostemum olivaceum thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its specialized morphology allows it to anchor itself to rocks and withstand strong currents.</p>
