                    <h1>Pilocereus gaumeri</h1>
<p>Pilocereus gaumeri, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a flowering cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, flattened stem that resembles a flat disc, often covered in white or grayish spines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the plant is often grafted onto another cactus species, such as Hylocereus, for structural support.</p>
