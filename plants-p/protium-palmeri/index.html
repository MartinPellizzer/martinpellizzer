                            <h1>Protium Palmeri</h1>
<p>Protium palmeri is a rare and unique plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, commonly known as the frankincense and myrrh family. This evergreen tree or shrub is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant, resinous sap. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Understanding and protecting Protium palmeri is crucial for preserving biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
