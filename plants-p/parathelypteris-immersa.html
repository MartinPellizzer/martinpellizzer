<p>Parathelypteris immersa, commonly known as the submerged water fern, is a unique species of fern that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant's rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Its leaves are usually dark green and may exhibit a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Parathelypteris immersa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
