                    <h1>Pagamea coriacea var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Pagamea coriacea var. pubescens, commonly known as the rough-leaved pagamea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The varietal form, pubescens, is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to the typical variety.</p>
