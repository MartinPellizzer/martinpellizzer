<p>Poa binata, commonly known as the twinflower bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the northern United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Poa binata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
