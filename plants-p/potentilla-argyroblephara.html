<p>Potentilla argyroblephara, commonly known as silver-eyes cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-white leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
