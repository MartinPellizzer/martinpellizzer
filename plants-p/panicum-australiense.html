                    <h1>Panicum australiense</h1>
<p>Panicum australiense, commonly known as Australian foxtail, is a perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that resemble foxtails, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize open spaces.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural and natural environments.</p>
