                    <h1>Peltophorum vogelianum f. ferruginea</h1>
<p>Peltophorum vogelianum f. ferruginea, commonly known as the red sandalwood or ironwood tree, is a distinctive tropical species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-brown pubescence, giving it its specific epithet "ferruginea.". The tree produces showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for its durability and has been traditionally used in construction and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
