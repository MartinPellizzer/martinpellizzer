                    <h1>Platystele schneideri</h1>
<p>Platystele schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico and Central America. The plant features a slender, leafless stem and produces delicate, white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
