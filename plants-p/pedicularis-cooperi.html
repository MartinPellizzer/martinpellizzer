                    <h1>Pedicularis cooperi</h1>
<p>Pedicularis cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Native to the mountainous regions of western North America, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
