                    <h1>Panicum secundum var. inaequiglume</h1>
<p>Panicum secundum var. inaequiglume, commonly known as the unequal-glume panicgrass, is a grass species characterized by its unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, with the lower glumes being shorter than the upper ones, giving it its varietal name.</p>
<p>This variation in glume length is a distinguishing trait in its morphology.</p>
