<p>Pycreus longus, commonly known as the long-spurred pycreus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and intricate, spurred flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white blooms that are often hidden among its dense foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a subject of ongoing botanical research.</p>
