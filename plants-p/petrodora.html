                    <h1>Petrodora</h1>
<p>Petrodora, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant species that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often display a striking combination of colors. The plant has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils by forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture from the limited availability of water in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Petrodora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
