<p>Plantago glabrata, commonly known as narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright, hairy stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a specialized structure called an utricle, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
