                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender pine, is a variety of the Spanish pine that is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and relatively small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces cones that are typically smaller than those of the typical Pinus uncinata. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
