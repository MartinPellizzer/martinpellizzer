                    <h1>Pilothecium lutescens</h1>
<p>Pilothecium lutescens, commonly known as the yellow pilothecium, is a unique member of the Pilothecium genus, characterized by its distinctive yellowish to orange-colored sporocarps.</p>
<p>It is a saprophytic plant, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant produces spores within its sporocarps, which are small, cup-shaped structures that aid in spore dispersal. Its morphology includes a basal stalk and a cup-like structure with a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>Pilothecium lutescens plays a minor role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem due to its decomposer activity.</p>
