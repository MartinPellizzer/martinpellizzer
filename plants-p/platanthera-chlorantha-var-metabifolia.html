                    <h1>Platanthera chlorantha var. metabifolia</h1>
<p>Platanthera chlorantha var. metabifolia, commonly known as the green-flowered twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
