<p>Polypodium pseudofraternum, commonly known as the false staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees, using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a fleshy, tree-like structure and large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
