                    <h1>Pneumatopteris superba</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris superba, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow, and feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are capable of floating on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis and gas exchange.</p>
