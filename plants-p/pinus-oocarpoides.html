                    <h1>Pinus oocarpoides</h1>
<p>Pinus oocarpoides, commonly known as the African white pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in clusters of five. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid to moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
