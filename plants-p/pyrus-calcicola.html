<p>Pyrus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone pear, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions with calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich habitats, demonstrating a high degree of adaptation to alkaline conditions. Its fruit, which is usually small and edible, plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus calcicola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
