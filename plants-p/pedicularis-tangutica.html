<p>Pedicularis tangutica, commonly known as the Tangut lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
