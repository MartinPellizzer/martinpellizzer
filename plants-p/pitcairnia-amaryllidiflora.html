                    <h1>Pitcairnia amaryllidiflora</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia amaryllidiflora, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in a spike, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
