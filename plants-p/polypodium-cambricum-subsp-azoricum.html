<p>Polypodium cambricum subsp.</p>
<p>azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean polypody, is a fern species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky or wooded slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's climate and its limited distribution.</p>
