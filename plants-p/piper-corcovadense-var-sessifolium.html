                    <h1>Piper corcovadense var. sessifolium</h1>
<p>Piper corcovadense var. sessifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf pepper plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and attach directly to the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible but have a mild, peppery flavor. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role in both horticulture and traditional medicine.</p>
