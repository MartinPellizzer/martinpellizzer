<p>Polypodium fluviatile, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium fluviatile plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
