                    <h1>Phoradendron rufescens</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rufescens, commonly known as the red flame or red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on oak trees in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to spread to new host trees.</p>
<p>Phoradendron rufescens plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
