                    <h1>Polypodium crenatodentatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium crenatodentatum, commonly known as the serrated-leaf polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which helps it absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
