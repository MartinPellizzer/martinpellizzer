<p>Peperomia stelechophila var. glabrata, commonly known as the glossy peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, upright growth with oval to lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The leaves are usually hairless, giving the plant its varietal name "glabrata," which means "smooth" in Latin. It produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are borne in clusters near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its attractive foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light.</p>
