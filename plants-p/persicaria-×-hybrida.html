                    <h1>Persicaria × hybrida</h1>
<p>Persicaria × hybrida, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth system, which allows it to spread rapidly and invade new areas. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams, ditches, and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
