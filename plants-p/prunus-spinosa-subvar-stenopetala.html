<p>Prunus spinosa subvar. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical blackthorn. The plant produces small, black berries that are often used in jams and traditional medicines. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, blooming early in the spring before the leaves fully develop.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments.</p>
