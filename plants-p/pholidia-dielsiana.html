                    <h1>Pholidia dielsiana</h1>
<p>Pholidia dielsiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood or dielsian sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark red or reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fragrance. The plant typically grows in coastal forests and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and white or pale pink, often clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Pholidia dielsiana is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
