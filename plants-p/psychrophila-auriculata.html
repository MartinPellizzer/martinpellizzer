<p>Psychrophila auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate psychrophile, is a rare alpine plant adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude regions where temperatures remain low year-round. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
