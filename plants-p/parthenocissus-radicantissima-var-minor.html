                    <h1>Parthenocissus radicantissima var. minor</h1>
<p>Parthenocissus radicantissima var. minor, commonly known as the creeping woodbine, is a vigorous climbing vine native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically five-lobed, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the summer, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often considered astringent. Its strong tendrils allow it to climb and spread over walls, trellises, and other structures.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide dense coverage in gardens.</p>
