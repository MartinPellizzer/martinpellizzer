                    <h1>Ptarmica ambrosiaca</h1>
<p>Ptarmica ambrosiaca, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains high levels of volatile oils, particularly thujone, which contribute to its strong, bitter scent. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
