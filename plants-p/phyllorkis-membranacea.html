                    <h1>Phyllorkis membranacea</h1>
<p>Phyllorkis membranacea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly silhouettes against the forest floor. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
