                    <h1>Puya pusilla</h1>
<p>Puya pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf torch flower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>This evergreen perennial is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a tight, water-holding cup at the center. It produces tall, spire-like inflorescences bearing vibrant red or orange bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
