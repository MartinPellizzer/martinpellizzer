<p>Polythecanthum cambodianum, commonly known as the Cambodian starflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the dense rainforests of Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender, woody stem. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered critically endangered and requires urgent protection efforts.</p>
