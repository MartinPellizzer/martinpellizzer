                    <h1>Pinus larix var. russica</h1>
<p>Pinus larix var. russica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden and fall off in autumn, distinguishing it from evergreen conifers. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>This hardy species is well adapted to harsh, snowy environments and is often used in reforestation efforts in boreal regions.</p>
