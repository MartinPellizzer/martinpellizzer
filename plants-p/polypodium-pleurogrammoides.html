<p>Polypodium pleurogrammoides, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered into clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its rhizome is creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in humid, tropical habitats.</p>
