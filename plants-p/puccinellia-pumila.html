                    <h1>Puccinellia pumila</h1>
<p>Puccinellia pumila, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Puccinellia pumila is also used in livestock forage due to its nutritional value and hardiness.</p>
