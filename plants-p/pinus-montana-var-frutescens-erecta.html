                    <h1>Pinus montana var. frutescens-erecta</h1>
<p>Pinus montana var. frutescens-erecta, commonly known as the erect form of the mountain pine, is a variant of the mountain pine characterized by its more upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude regions, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five, and it produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh mountain environments, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance.</p>
