<p>Phlebodium nigripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on shaded, moist rock faces or tree trunks. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Phlebodium nigripes is adapted to thrive in humid, low-light environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance.</p>
