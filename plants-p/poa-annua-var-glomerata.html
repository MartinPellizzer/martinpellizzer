                    <h1>Poa annua var. glomerata</h1>
<p>Poa annua var. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue-green blades that often form dense mats. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems, giving it its specific epithet "glomerata.". It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it is both a desirable turfgrass and a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
