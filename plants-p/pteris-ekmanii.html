<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with numerous small, finger-like segments that give it a finely textured appearance.</p>
