<p>Paspalum sanguinale var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf bloodgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically reddish or purplish in color, especially under stress or during certain seasons. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
