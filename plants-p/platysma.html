                    <h1>Platysma</h1>
<p>Platysma, commonly known as the "forehead muscle," is a thin, fibrous muscle located in the neck and upper chest area.</p>
<p>It plays a key role in facial expressions, particularly in pulling the skin of the neck and lower face upward. Botanically, it is not a plant but a muscular structure in the human body. However, the term "platysma" is also used in botany to describe certain plant structures, such as a type of leaf or stem modification.</p>
<p>This dual usage can sometimes lead to confusion between anatomical and botanical contexts.</p>
