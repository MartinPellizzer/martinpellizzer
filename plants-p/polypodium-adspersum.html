<p>Polypodium adspersum, commonly known as the broad-leafed cliff fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Polypodium adspersum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
