                    <h1>Poa arida</h1>
<p>Poa arida, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Poa arida is well-suited to poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in dryland ecosystems.</p>
