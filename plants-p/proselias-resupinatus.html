<p>Proselias resupinatus, commonly known as the creeping snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with prostrate stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
