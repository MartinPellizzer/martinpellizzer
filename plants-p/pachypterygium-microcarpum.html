                    <h1>Pachypterygium microcarpum</h1>
<p>Pachypterygium microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited pachypterygium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, fleshy fruits that mature to a pale yellow or orange color. The plant typically thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
