<p>Panicum arctum, commonly known as Arctic grass, is a hardy perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is characterized by its low-growing, dense clumps of narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil in harsh, icy conditions.</p>
<p>Panicum arctum plays a vital role in Arctic ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
