<p>Polypodium pubinerve, commonly known as the hairy nerve fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which helps in attracting certain nocturnal pollinators.</p>
