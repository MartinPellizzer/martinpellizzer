                    <h1>Plectronia graniticola</h1>
<p>Plectronia graniticola, commonly known as the granitic rock lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in harsh, rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. This plant-like organism is often found growing on granite and other acidic rocks in arid or semi-arid regions. Its structure is typically crust-like, forming a thin, layered coating on the surface of its substrate.</p>
<p>Plectronia graniticola plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in rocky ecosystems.</p>
