<p>Ptilagrostis mongholica subsp.</p>
<p>porteri, commonly known as the Mongolian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia and northern China. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in dry landscapes.</p>
