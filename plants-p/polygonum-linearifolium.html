<p>It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom in the summer months.

<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a hardy and potentially invasive species in certain environments.</p>
