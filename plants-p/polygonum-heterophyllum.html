                    <h1>Polygonum heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Polygonum heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable knotweed, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped with toothed margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, streambanks, and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain areas.</p>
