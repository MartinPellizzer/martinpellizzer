<p>Phacelia magellanica var. alpina, commonly known as the Antarctic phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in cold, arid environments, often found in the Andes and Antarctic regions. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This species is known for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine ecosystems.</p>
