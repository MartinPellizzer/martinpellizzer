                    <h1>Prestonia tomentosa</h1>
<p>Prestonia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly prestonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub that produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich nature.</p>
