<p>Polypodium billardierei var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf wall fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant's rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of rhizomorphs, which help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
