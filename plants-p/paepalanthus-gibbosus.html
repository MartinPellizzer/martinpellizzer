                    <h1>Paepalanthus gibbosus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus gibbosus, commonly known as the globular cacti, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and is often covered in dense, spiny bracts. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, waxy body. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
