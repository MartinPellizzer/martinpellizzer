<p>Pelargonium × lineatum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from various species of geraniums.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, slightly lobed leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its vigorous growth.</p>
<p>Pelargonium × lineatum is also popular for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
