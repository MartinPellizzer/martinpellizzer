<p>It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Psammophila bellidifolia plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
