                    <h1>Poa annua var. tommasinii</h1>
<p>Poa annua var. tommasinii, commonly known as the Italian meadow grass, is a variant of the annual bluegrass species.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense mats in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
