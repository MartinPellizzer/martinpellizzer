                    <h1>Potentilla baldensis</h1>
<p>Potentilla baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Potentilla baldensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range.</p>
