<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, linear fronds with closely spaced, delicate veins that give it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
