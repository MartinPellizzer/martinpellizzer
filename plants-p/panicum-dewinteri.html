                    <h1>Panicum dewinteri</h1>
<p>Panicum dewinteri, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fine, wiry leaves and produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are often wind-dispersed. The plant typically thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in xeriscaped gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
