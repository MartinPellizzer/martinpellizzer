                    <h1>Polypodium espinosae</h1>
<p>Polypodium espinosae, commonly known as the Espinoza's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is covered in a thick, fibrous layer, which helps it anchor in soil and retain moisture.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns.</p>
