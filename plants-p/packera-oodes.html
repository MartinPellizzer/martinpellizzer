<p>Packera oodes, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowering stems rise from the center of the rosette, bearing yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Packera oodes is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
