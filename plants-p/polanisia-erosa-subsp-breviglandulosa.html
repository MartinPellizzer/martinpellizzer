<p>Polanisia erosa subsp.</p>
<p>breviglandulosa, commonly known as the slender-fruited polanisia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
<p>The plant features opposite, lanceolate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, white to pale green flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and subtle floral display, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
