                    <h1>Pinus mugo var. mughus</h1>
<p>Pinus mugo var. mughus, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slow growth rate and dense, shrub-like form, with short, twisted branches and needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often forming dense thickets in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control in rocky landscapes.</p>
