<p>Pedicularis elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic nature, relying on host plants for some of its nutritional needs. The plant features elongated, slender stems and striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange-red. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Pedicularis elongata is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it contributes to the unique biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
