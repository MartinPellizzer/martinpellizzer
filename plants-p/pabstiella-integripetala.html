                    <h1>Pabstiella integripetala</h1>
<p>Pabstiella integripetala, commonly known as the smooth-petaled pabstiella, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, showy flowers with smooth, unribbed petals. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous habitats. Its reproductive strategy involves specific pollinators, which are adapted to its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella integripetala is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
