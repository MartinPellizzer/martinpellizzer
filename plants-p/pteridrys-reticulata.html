                    <h1>Pteridrys reticulata</h1>
<p>Pteridrys reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate, net-like venation pattern on its fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
