<p>Poa annua var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous annual bluegrass, is a variant of the common annual bluegrass.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce viviparous seeds, which germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This trait allows it to establish quickly in disturbed soils and thrive in a variety of habitats. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, lawns, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include slender stems, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
