<p>Puccinellia korshinskyana, commonly known as the Korshinsky's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
