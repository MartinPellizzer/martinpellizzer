                    <h1>Prionopsis ciliata</h1>
<p>Prionopsis ciliata, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to yellowish-green thallus with a distinctive, silky texture due to its finely branched rhizines. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with the ability to photosynthesize. It typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Prionopsis ciliata is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
