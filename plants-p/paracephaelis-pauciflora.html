Native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant has a short flowering period, making it challenging to study in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
