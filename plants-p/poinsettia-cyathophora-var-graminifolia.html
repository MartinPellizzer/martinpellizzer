                    <h1>Poinsettia cyathophora var. graminifolia</h1>
<p>Poinsettia cyathophora var. graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy poinsettia, is a unique variant of the poinsettia species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and reduced bracts compared to the more common poinsettia varieties. The plant typically grows in a compact, shrub-like form with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>While less commercially popular than other poinsettia varieties, it is appreciated for its ornamental value and unique foliage structure.</p>
