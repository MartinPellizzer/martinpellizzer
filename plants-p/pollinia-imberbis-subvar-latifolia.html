<p>Pollinia imberbis subvar. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its unique pollination structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is distinguished by its elongated, fleshy pollinia, which are adapted for attachment to the bodies of pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing structural support and efficient photosynthesis.</p>
