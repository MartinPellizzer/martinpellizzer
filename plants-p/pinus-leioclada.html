<p>Pinus leioclada, commonly known as the smooth bark pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, distinguishing it from other pine species.</p>
<p>Pinus leioclada is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
