<p>Parnassia pseudoalpicola, commonly known as the alpine parnassia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, characterized by its showy, white or pale yellow flowers that often have a distinctive central pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are often borne on slender, hairy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parnassia pseudoalpicola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
