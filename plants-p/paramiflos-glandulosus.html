                    <h1>Paramiflos glandulosus</h1>
<p>Paramiflos glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with multiple stems, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some animals.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions have been studied for their potential use in natural pest control.</p>
