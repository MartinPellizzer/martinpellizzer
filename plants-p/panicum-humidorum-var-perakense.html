                    <h1>Panicum humidorum var. perakense</h1>
<p>Panicum humidorum var. perakense, commonly known as the Perak grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy habitats, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
