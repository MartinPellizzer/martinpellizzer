                    <h1>Pachyphyllum scandens</h1>
<p>Pachyphyllum scandens, commonly known as the climbing stonecrop, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its climbing habit allows it to attach to surfaces using specialized structures called holdfasts.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
