<p>Phegopteris erubescens, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released when the spore cases mature.</p>
