                    <h1>Ponthieva micromystax</h1>
<p>Ponthieva micromystax, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, bright green leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species.</p>
