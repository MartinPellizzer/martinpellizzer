                    <h1>Pinguicula grandiflora var. dertosensis</h1>
<p>Pinguicula grandiflora var. dertosensis, commonly known as the Dertos heath sunflower, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with yellow, sunflower-like blooms that attract pollinators. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and bright light.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
