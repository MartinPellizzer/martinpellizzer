The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens.</p>
