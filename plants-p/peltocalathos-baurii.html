<p>Peltocalathos baurii, commonly known as the Baur's peltocalathos, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its unique, flattened, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peltocalathos baurii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying desert flora.</p>
