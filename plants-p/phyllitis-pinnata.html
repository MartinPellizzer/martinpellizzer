<p>Phyllitis pinnata, commonly known as the water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, finger-like segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which can help stabilize sediments.</p>
<p>Phyllitis pinnata is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
