<p>Psammisia dolichopoda, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. It has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss, and its stems are often prostrate or ascending.</p>
<p>Psammisia dolichopoda plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
