                    <h1>Polypodium trabeculatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium trabeculatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often grow on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium trabeculatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
