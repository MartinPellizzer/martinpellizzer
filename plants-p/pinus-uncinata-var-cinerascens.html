                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. cinerascens</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray pine, is a rare variant of the serotinous pine native to the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive ash-gray bark and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical species. The cones of this variety are often retained on the tree for many years, a trait common in serotinous pines. It thrives in high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
