                    <h1>Potentilla tabernaemontani subvar. pusilla</h1>
<p>Potentilla tabernaemontani subvar. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with dense, mat-forming growth that helps it survive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
