                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. calcatum</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. calcatum, commonly known as the dwarf prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, along streambanks, and in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
