                    <h1>Pinus fenzleyi</h1>
<p>Pinus fenzleyi, commonly known as the Fenzley pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The tree has short, twisted branches and produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
