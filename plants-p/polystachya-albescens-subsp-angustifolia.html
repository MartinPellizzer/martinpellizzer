<p>Polystachya albescens subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
