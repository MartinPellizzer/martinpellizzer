<p>Poa attica, commonly known as the Greek meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Poa attica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
