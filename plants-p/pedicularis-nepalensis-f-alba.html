                    <h1>Pedicularis nepalensis f. alba</h1>
<p>Pedicularis nepalensis f. alba, commonly known as the white monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its showy, white, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
