                    <h1>Plagiobothrys tener var. fallax</h1>
<p>Plagiobothrys tener var. fallax, commonly known as the hairy leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and the species is adapted to rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more robust and hairy foliage compared to other varieties within the Plagiobothrys genus.</p>
