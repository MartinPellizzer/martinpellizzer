                    <h1>Platanthera yosemitensis</h1>
<p>Platanthera yosemitensis, commonly known as the Yosemite coralroot, is a rare orchid species native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces delicate, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
