<p>Piriqueta sidifolia var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora piriqueta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces small, delicate white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
