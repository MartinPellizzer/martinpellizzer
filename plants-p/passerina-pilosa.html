<p>Passerina pilosa, commonly known as the silky pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with a distinctive, nodding appearance, typically blooming in early spring. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Passerina pilosa is an important species in alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization.</p>
