                    <h1>Prasophyllum secutum</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum secutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in sandy or loamy soils. The plant has a slender, wiry stem with a few broad, linear leaves, and it produces a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is common among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
