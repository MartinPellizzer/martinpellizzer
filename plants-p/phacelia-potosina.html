<p>Phacelia potosina, commonly known as the Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Phacelia potosina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
