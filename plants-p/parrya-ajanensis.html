                    <h1>Parrya ajanensis</h1>
<p>Parrya ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajanensis parrya, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parrya ajanensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
