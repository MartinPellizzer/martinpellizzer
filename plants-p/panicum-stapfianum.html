<p>Panicum stapfianum, commonly known as the Stapf's panicgrass, is a species of grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often appear in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Panicum stapfianum is often found in rocky outcrops and along dry streambeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna.</p>
