                    <h1>Pinus laricio var. austriaca</h1>
<p>Pinus laricio var. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian stone pine, is a variant of the stone pine native to the Alps and Carpathian regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The needles are typically longer and more rigid compared to other pine species, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces cones that are usually smaller and more conical than those of the typical stone pine.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and poor soils, making it a resilient and ornamental tree in mountainous landscapes.</p>
