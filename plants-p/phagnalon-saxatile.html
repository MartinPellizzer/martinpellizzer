                <h1>Phagnalon saxatile</h1>
<p>Phagnalon saxatile, commonly known as rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikes. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in harsh environments where water is scarce. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Phagnalon saxatile is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens.</p>
