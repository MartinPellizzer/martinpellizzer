<p>Pilosella iserana subsp.</p>
<p>confinium, commonly known as the Alpine hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly larger leaves compared to other Pilosella species. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes, often forming dense mats in mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
