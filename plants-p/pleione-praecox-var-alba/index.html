                            <h1>Pleione Praecox Var. Alba</h1>
<p>Alpine white orchid, scientifically known as Pleione praecox var. alba, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. This orchid thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest clearings at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are characterized by their pale white petals and a subtle fragrance that lingers in the mountain air. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, the Alpine white orchid is considered an endangered species. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique and beautiful member of the orchid family.</p>
