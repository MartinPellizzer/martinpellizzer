                    <h1>Polypodium levigatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium levigatum, commonly known as the licorice fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety coating. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid environments. Its rhizome is fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
