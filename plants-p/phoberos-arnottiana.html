<p>Phoberos arnottiana, commonly known as the Arnold's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are pale green and often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Phoberos arnottiana is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
