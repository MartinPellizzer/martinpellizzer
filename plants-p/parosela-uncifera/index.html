                            <h1>Parosela Uncifera</h1>
<p>Parosela snowdrop, scientifically known as Parosela uncifera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Eastern Himalayas. This species is celebrated for its early blooming habit, often appearing among the snow before spring fully arrives. Its striking white flowers with green markings make it a distinctive feature of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate shifts. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical gem for future generations.</p>
