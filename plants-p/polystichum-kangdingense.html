<p>Polystichum kangdingense, commonly known as the Kangding fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests at high altitudes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
