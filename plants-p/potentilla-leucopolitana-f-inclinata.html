                    <h1>Potentilla leucopolitana f. inclinata</h1>
<p>Potentilla leucopolitana f. inclinata, commonly known as the inclining white potentilla, is a rare and specialized plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is typically dense and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
