<p>Physaria rosei subsp.</p>
<p>perotensis, commonly known as the Perot's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a bluish-green color and a pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
