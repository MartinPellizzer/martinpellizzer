<p>Polygala missurica, commonly known as the Missourian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils along streambanks and wetlands, thriving in partial to full sun. Its foliage consists of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy to the touch.</p>
<p>Polygala missurica plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as well-known as other milkweed species for its ecological importance.</p>
