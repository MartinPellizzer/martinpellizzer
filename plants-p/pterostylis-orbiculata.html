<p>Pterostylis orbiculata, commonly known as the rounded hammer orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, club-shaped flower that resembles a hammer, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem with a single, distinctive flower that is typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys.</p>
<p>The orchid is pollinated by thynnid wasps, which are attracted by its intricate mimicry of female wasps.</p>
