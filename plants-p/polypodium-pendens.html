                    <h1>Polypodium pendens</h1>
<p>Polypodium pendens, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than from soil. The plant features long, arching fronds with a distinctive, slender, and often drooping appearance. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments.</p>
<p>Polypodium pendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens.</p>
