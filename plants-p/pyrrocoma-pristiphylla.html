<p>Pyrrocoma pristiphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pyrrocoma, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often covered in a fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Pyrrocoma pristiphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
