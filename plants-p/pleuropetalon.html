<p>Pleuropetalon, commonly known as the "butterfly orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers that often feature intricate patterns and vibrant colors. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia, where they typically grow in shaded, moist environments. Pleuropetalon species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral morphology and ecological role in their native habitats.</p>
