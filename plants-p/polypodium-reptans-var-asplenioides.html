                    <h1>Polypodium reptans var. asplenioides</h1>
<p>Polypodium reptans var. asplenioides, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while spreading vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
