                    <h1>Phyllanthus chamaecerasus f. ripicola</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus chamaecerasus f. ripicola, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which are pollinated by insects. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
