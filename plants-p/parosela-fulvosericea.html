                    <h1>Parosela fulvosericea</h1>
<p>Parosela fulvosericea, commonly known as the golden silky orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small but showy, with petals that are softly textured and often covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Parosela fulvosericea is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
