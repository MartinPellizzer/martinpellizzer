                    <h1>Pinus pseudopumilio</h1>
<p>Pinus pseudopumilio, commonly known as the alpine white pine, is a rare and cold-adapted conifer native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against the snowy environment. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in harsh, high-altitude conditions with limited soil and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Pinus pseudopumilio is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
