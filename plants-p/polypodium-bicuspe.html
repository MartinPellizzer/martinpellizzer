                    <h1>Polypodium bicuspe</h1>
<p>Polypodium bicuspe, commonly known as the two-toothed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that typically grow in a rosette pattern. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety tissue, which helps in water retention. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Polypodium bicuspe thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests.</p>
