                    <h1>Pyrrosia foveolata var. lauterbachii</h1>
<p>Pyrrosia foveolata var. lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's rock fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are concealed by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
