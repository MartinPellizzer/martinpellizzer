                    <h1>Peumus</h1>
<p>Peumus, commonly known as the boxwood or box tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Asia, Europe, and North America. Peumus species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are usually leathery and glossy, providing ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>They are often used in horticulture for topiary and as ornamental shrubs due to their slow growth and ability to maintain shape.</p>
