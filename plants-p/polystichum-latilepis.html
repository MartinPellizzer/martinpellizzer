<p>Polystichum latilepis, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a dense, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum latilepis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
