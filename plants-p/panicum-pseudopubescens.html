<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, bract-bearing flowering structures.</p>
