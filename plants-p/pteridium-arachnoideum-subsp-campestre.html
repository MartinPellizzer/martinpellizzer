<p>Pteridium arachnoideum subsp.</p>
<p>campestre, commonly known as the field bracken, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in sunny, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands.</p>
