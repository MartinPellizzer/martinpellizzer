<p>Phegopteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are covered in small, rounded lobes.</p>
