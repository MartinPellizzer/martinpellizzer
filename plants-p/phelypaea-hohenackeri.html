<p>Phelypaea hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's water fern, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>

The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically submerged, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
