                    <h1>Pristimera goetzei</h1>
<p>Pristimera goetzei, commonly known as the Goetze's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its small, fleshy leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in the humid, shaded understory of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Pristimera goetzei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
