                    <h1>Paepalanthus salticola</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus salticola, commonly known as the jumping bean plant, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. The plant is notable for its distinctive, elongated, and sometimes hollow stems that can appear to "jump" when disturbed, a phenomenon caused by the movement of its seeds inside the stem. Its foliage forms a rosette that can collect water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus salticola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
