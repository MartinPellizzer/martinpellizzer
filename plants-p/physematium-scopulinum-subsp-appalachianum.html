<p>Physematium scopulinum subsp.</p>
<p>appalachianum, commonly known as the Appalachian star moss, is a rare and diminutive liverwort found in moist, shaded environments across the Appalachian region. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, star-shaped growth pattern composed of closely packed, leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a unique morphology with small, radially symmetrical thalli that form a carpet-like mat on the forest floor. It thrives in nutrient-rich, acidic soils and is often found in association with decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-quality ecosystems.</p>
