                    <h1>Pitcairnia penduliflora</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flower pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with bright, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
