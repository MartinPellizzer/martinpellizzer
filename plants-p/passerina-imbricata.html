                    <h1>Passerina imbricata</h1>
<p>Passerina imbricata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a shallow root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Passerina imbricata is often found growing in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
