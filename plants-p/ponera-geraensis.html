<p>Ponera geraensis, commonly known as the Geraenian fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Gera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate fronds, which are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ponera geraensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
