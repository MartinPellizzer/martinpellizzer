                    <h1>Polypodium sanctae-rosae</h1>
<p>Polypodium sanctae-rosae, commonly known as the sacred rose fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
