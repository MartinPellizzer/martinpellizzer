<p>Polypodium kalbreyeri, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth.</p>
