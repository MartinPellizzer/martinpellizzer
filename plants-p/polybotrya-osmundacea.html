                    <h1>Polybotrya osmundacea</h1>
<p>Polybotrya osmundacea, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cone-like formations on the fronds.</p>
