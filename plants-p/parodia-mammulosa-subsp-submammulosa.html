<p>Parodia mammulosa subsp.</p>
<p>submammulosa, commonly known as the "Pincushion Cactus," is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense covering of white to pale green spines, which give it a pincushion-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, cylindrical stem with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
