                    <h1>Peperomia breviramula</h1>
<p>Peperomia breviramula, commonly known as the compact peperomia, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
