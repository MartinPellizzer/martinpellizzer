<p>Poa annua subsp.</p>
<p>exilis, commonly known as slender annual bluegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a tendency to form dense, mat-like growth patterns.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed sites. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a common weed and a valued forage plant in certain agricultural contexts.</p>
