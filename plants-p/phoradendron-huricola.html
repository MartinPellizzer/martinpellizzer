                    <h1>Phoradendron huricola</h1>
<p>Phoradendron huricola, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the tropics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Phoradendron huricola is often found in humid, shaded environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
