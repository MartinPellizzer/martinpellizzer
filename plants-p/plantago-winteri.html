                    <h1>Plantago winteri</h1>
<p>Plantago winteri, commonly known as the Alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects in degraded mountain environments.</p>
