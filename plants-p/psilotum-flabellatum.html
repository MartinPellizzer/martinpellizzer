                    <h1>Psilotum flabellatum</h1>
<p>Psilotum flabellatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that lack true veins. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage, it provides important insights into the evolutionary history of vascular plants.</p>
