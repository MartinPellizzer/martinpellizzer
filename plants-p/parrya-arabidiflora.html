                    <h1>Parrya arabidiflora</h1>
<p>Parrya arabidiflora, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit, often forming dense mats to conserve moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Parrya arabidiflora is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
