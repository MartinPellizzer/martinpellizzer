                    <h1>Polycnemum vulgare</h1>
<p>Polycnemum vulgare, commonly known as common bladderwrack, is a perennial seaweed belonging to the family Fucaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark brown, leathery fronds that are often covered in small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which help it float. This plant thrives in intertidal zones along rocky coastlines, where it attaches itself to rocks using a holdfast. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Polycnemum vulgare is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of alginates for industrial applications.</p>
