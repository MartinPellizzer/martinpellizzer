                            <h1>Pulsatilla Integrifolia</h1>
<p>Pulsatilla integrifolia, also known as the common pasqueflower, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. Its showy, violet-blue flowers bloom in late spring, adding a vivid splash of color to rocky meadows. The plant's unique structure includes a hairy stem and palmate leaves, making it easily recognizable. Despite its beauty, it is also known for its toxic properties, containing various alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
