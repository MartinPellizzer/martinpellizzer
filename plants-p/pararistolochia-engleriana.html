<p>Pararistolochia engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's false bugloss, is a climbing vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spiral-like inflorescences. Its stems are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
