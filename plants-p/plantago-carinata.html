                    <h1>Plantago carinata</h1>
<p>Plantago carinata, commonly known as the curled dock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often curled at the edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a dense spike that rises from the center of the rosette. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings.</p>
