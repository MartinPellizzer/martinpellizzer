<p>Pedilonum asperifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved pedilonum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies in semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
