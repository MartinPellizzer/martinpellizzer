<p>Pritchardia limahuliensis, commonly known as the Limahuli pandanus, is a rare cycad species endemic to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
