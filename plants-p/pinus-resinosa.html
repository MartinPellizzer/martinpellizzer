                    <h1>Pinus resinosa</h1>
<p>Pinus resinosa, commonly known as the pitch pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in pairs. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pitch pine is adapted to fire-prone environments and can regenerate from heat-treated seeds.</p>
<p>Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against forest fires.</p>
