                    <h1>Phragmites australis var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Phragmites australis var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow reed, is a variant of the common reed that is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage.</p>
<p>It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant forms dense stands and has hollow, jointed stems that are often used as nesting material by birds. Its rhizomes spread extensively, allowing it to dominate wetland habitats and stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This variant is often confused with other Phragmites species due to its similar appearance, but its yellowish coloration is a key identifying feature.</p>
