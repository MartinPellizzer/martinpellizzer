<p>Panicum caricoides var. pilosum, commonly known as silky grass or silky panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, silky-haired inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
