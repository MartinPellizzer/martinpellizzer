                    <h1>Potentilla rubripes var. minutifolia</h1>
<p>Potentilla rubripes var. minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf fireweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features small, glandular leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed northern landscapes.</p>
