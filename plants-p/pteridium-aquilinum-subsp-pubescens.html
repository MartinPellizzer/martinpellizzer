<p>Pteridium aquilinum subsp.</p>
<p>pubescens, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are often covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome system allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its successful reproduction and ecological dominance.</p>
