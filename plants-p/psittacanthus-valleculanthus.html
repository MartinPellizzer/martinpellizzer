<p>Psittacanthus valleculanthus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble small stars. The plant features bright green, leathery leaves with a serrated margin, and it produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
