                    <h1>Paragynoxys neodendroides</h1>
<p>Paragynoxys neodendroides, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host for nutrients, using specialized structures called haustoria to absorb water and minerals. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to most animals but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in humid, forested environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host trees over time, making it a significant concern in forest ecosystems.</p>
