                    <h1>Phlegmatospermum drummondii</h1>
<p>Phlegmatospermum drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's phlegmatosperm, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the order Phlegmariopales.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of a network of filaments. This species is characterized by its ability to absorb water and nutrients directly through its surface, a trait common among mosses and liverworts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
