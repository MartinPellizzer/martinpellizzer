                    <h1>Potamogeton × subdentatus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × subdentatus, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant that exhibits a combination of characteristics from its parent species, Potamogeton obtusifolius and Potamogeton subdentatus.</p>
<p>It typically has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged spirally along the stem, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin depending on the genetic influence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential can lead to dense growth that may alter water quality and compete with native vegetation.</p>
