                    <h1>Poa ligularis var. resinulosa</h1>
<p>Poa ligularis var. resinulosa, commonly known as the resinous bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
