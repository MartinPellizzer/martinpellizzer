<p>Pleurothallis subnulla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear without visible leaves, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on epiphytic growth habits to obtain moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually white or pale in color, and they bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Pleurothallis subnulla is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
