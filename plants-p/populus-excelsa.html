<p>Populus excelsa, commonly known as the white poplar, is a tall, fast-growing tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Its leaves are broadly ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Populus excelsa is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>
