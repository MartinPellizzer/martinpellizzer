                    <h1>Parnassia palustris f. rhodanthera</h1>
<p>Parnassia palustris f. rhodanthera, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare botanical variant of the marsh gentian.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its striking pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive red throat, which sets it apart from the typical white flowers of the species. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, often in regions with high humidity and poor soil drainage. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
