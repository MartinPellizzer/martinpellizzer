                    <h1>Papaver stubendorfii</h1>
<p>Papaver stubendorfii, commonly known as the Stubendorf poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a dark, almost black, central stigma, which makes it visually distinctive. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
