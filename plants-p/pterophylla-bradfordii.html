                    <h1>Pterophylla bradfordii</h1>
<p>Pterophylla bradfordii, commonly known as the Bradfords' fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive, ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
