<p>Phacellaria glomerata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rootless, floating shoots that bear small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are arranged in dense clusters, giving the plant its common name.</p>
<p>Phacellaria glomerata is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms.</p>
