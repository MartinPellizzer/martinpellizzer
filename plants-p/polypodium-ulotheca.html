<p>Polypodium ulotheca, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming species that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure composed of a flattened, ribbon-like body called a thallus, which lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces through spores released from sporangia that are clustered in structures called soridia.</p>
<p>Polypodium ulotheca plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
