                    <h1>Polygonum alpinum var. lapathifolium</h1>
<p>Polygonum alpinum var. lapathifolium, commonly known as alpine knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader, more lobed leaves compared to the typical form of Polygonum alpinum.</p>
