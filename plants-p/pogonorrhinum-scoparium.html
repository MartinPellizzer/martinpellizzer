<p>Pogonorrhinum scoparium, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils along the shoreline. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its botanical features include a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age, and it is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>Pogonorrhinum scoparium is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind, making it well adapted to harsh maritime environments.</p>
