<p>Potentilla tabernaemontani subsp.</p>
<p>aurulenta, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, golden-yellow hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and are covered in the same fine hairs as the stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings.</p>
