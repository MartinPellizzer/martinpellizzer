<p>Polypodium altum, commonly known as the tall wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has long, narrow fronds that can reach several feet in length, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of leaflets. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium altum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to adapt to various substrates in its natural habitat.</p>
