<p>Pleurothallis hastulata, commonly known as the arrowroot orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a cluster of arrows, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
