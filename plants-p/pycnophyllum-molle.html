<p>Pycnophyllum molle, commonly known as the soft-leafed pycnophyllum, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems in its native range.</p>
