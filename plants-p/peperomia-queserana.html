<p>Peperomia queserana, commonly known as the Brazilian peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Peperomia queserana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage.</p>
