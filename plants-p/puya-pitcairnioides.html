                    <h1>Puya pitcairnioides</h1>
<p>Puya pitcairnioides, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, spire-like inflorescences adorned with vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom briefly before withering. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
