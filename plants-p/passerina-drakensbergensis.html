<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cooler, high-altitude environments of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
