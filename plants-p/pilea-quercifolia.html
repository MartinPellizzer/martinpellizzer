                    <h1>Pilea quercifolia</h1>
<p>Pilea quercifolia, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage that forms a compact, carpet-like growth. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy, glossy surface and a serrated margin. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in spring, followed by spherical, brownish seed capsules.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light.</p>
