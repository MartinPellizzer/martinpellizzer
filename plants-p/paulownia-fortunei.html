                    <h1>Paulownia fortunei</h1>
<p>Paulownia fortunei, commonly known as the empress tree or royal paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth rate and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are typically purple or pink in color. Its wood is lightweight, strong, and highly valued for its acoustic properties.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native species.</p>
