                    <h1>Potentilla argentea var. eremica</h1>
<p>Potentilla argentea var. eremica, commonly known as silver potentilla or desert cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
