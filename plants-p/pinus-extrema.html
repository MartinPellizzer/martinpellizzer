                    <h1>Pinus extrema</h1>
<p>Pinus extrema, commonly known as the extreme pine, is a rare and resilient conifer native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme weather conditions. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access limited water sources in arid or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Pinus extrema plays a vital role in stabilizing fragile mountain ecosystems.</p>
