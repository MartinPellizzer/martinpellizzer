                    <h1>Pinus pumilio var. turbinata</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio var. turbinata, commonly known as the alpine dwarf pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact size, often growing as a shrub rather than a tree, due to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. The leaves are typically needle-like, short, and densely packed, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry climates. Its cones are small and often remain closed for many years, releasing seeds only under specific environmental triggers.</p>
<p>This variety plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
