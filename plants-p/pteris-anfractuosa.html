                    <h1>Pteris anfractuosa</h1>
<p>Pteris anfractuosa, commonly known as the zigzag water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that exhibit a distinctive zigzag pattern along their length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
