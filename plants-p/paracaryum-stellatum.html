                    <h1>Paracaryum stellatum</h1>
<p>Paracaryum stellatum, commonly known as the star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial for soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Paracaryum stellatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water.</p>
