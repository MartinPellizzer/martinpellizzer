                    <h1>Polypodium tridactylum</h1>
<p>Polypodium tridactylum, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that curl into a compact, desiccated form when dry. The plant can revive and unfurl its fronds when exposed to moisture, a remarkable adaptation to its often arid environment. It thrives on tree trunks and rocks, deriving nutrients from rainwater and debris.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions makes it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
