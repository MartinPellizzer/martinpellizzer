<p>Poa phragmites, commonly known as tall meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
