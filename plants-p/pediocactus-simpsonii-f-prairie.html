<p>Pediocactus simpsonii f. prairie, commonly known as the prairie hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
