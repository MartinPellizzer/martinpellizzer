                    <h1>Pinus strobus f. fastigiata</h1>
<p>Pinus strobus f. fastigiata, commonly known as the stiff-branch white pine, is a unique form of the eastern white pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, which contrasts with the more spreading form of the typical white pine. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves, typically arranged in bundles of two, giving it a dense, compact appearance. Its cones are similar to those of the parent species, containing oval, light brown seeds.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking, geometric shape.</p>
