                    <h1>Paspalum dilatatum f. paucispica</h1>
<p>Paspalum dilatatum f. paucispica, commonly known as the slender paspalum, is a grass species characterized by its narrow, erect leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is often found in wetlands, lawns, and along roadsides, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
