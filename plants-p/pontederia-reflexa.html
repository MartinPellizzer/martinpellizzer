<p>Pontederia reflexa, commonly known as purple rush or pickerelweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots help stabilize soil in wetland environments, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Pontederia reflexa is also a valuable food source for waterfowl and other wetland wildlife.</p>
