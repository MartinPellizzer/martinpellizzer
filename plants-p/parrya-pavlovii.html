                    <h1>Parrya pavlovii</h1>
<p>Parrya pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's parrya, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Parrya pavlovii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
