                    <h1>Platystele johnstonii</h1>
<p>Platystele johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on specialized structures called pseudobulbs for water and nutrient storage. It is highly specialized, requiring specific microclimatic conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
