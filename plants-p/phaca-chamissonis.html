<p>Phaca chamissonis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Phaca chamissonis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
