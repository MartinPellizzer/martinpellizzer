                    <h1>Psidium itanareense</h1>
<p>Psidium itanareense, commonly known as the Itanareense guava, is a species native to Brazil, specifically the state of Bahia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries similar to common guavas. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in humid, shaded environments within its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Psidium genus.</p>
