                    <h1>Polygonum paludicola var. nikaii</h1>
<p>Polygonum paludicola var. nikaii, commonly known as Nikai's swamp knotweed, is a variant of the swamp knotweed species native to wetland environments in East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its semi-aquatic growth habit, with slender, often reddish stems that can float or root in shallow water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
