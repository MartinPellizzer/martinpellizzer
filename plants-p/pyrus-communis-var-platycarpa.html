                    <h1>Pyrus communis var. platycarpa</h1>
<p>Pyrus communis var. platycarpa, commonly known as the flat-seeded apple, is a botanical variant of the common apple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened seeds, which distinguish it from the typical rounded seeds of other apple varieties. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically less sweet and more tart than those of the standard apple. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates, showing typical apple tree growth habits.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique seed morphology and potential for genetic research.</p>
