<p>Plantago lanceolata subsp.</p>
<p>lacustris, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for water environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
