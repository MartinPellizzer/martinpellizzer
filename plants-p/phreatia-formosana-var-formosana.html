                    <h1>Phreatia formosana var. formosana</h1>
<p>Phreatia formosana var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan ghost orchid, is a rare and highly specialized orchid species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, thin roots that anchor it to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive ghost-like appearance, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
