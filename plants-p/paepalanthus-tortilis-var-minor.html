<p>Paepalanthus tortilis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
