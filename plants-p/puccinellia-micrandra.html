<p>Puccinellia micrandra, commonly known as narrowleaf saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant has adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of stabilizing dune and saline habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of wax, reducing water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Puccinellia micrandra plays a vital role in ecological systems by providing forage for wildlife and preventing soil erosion.</p>
