<p>Parakeelya remota, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that grows on the forest floor, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers with a unique, elongated shape. Its roots are specialized to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Parakeelya remota is considered a conservation concern.</p>
