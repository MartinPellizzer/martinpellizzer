<p>Ptychosperma micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a member of the cycad family, Cycadaceae, and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
