<p>Potentilla cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
