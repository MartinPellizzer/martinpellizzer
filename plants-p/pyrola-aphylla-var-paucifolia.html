                    <h1>Pyrola aphylla var. paucifolia</h1>
<p>Pyrola aphylla var. paucifolia, commonly known as the few-leaved wintergreen, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms dense mats of leathery, dark green leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually pink or white and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-quality forest ecosystems.</p>
