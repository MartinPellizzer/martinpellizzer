                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. borealis</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic white spruce, is a rare alpine variant of the white spruce.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are short and sharply pointed, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh Arctic and subarctic conditions, making it a hardy component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
