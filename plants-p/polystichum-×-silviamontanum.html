                    <h1>Polystichum × silviamontanum</h1>
<p>Polystichum × silviamontanum, commonly known as the Silviamontanum wood fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum acrostichum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The fern produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates.</p>
