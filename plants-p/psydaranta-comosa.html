                    <h1>Psydaranta comosa</h1>
<p>Psydaranta comosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a weed in disturbed areas.</p>
