                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus horridus</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus horridus, commonly known as the spiny barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Pyrrhocactus horridus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping.</p>
