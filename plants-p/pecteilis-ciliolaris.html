<p>Pecteilis ciliolaris, commonly known as the silky filmy fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the moist forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including small, spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pecteilis ciliolaris is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
