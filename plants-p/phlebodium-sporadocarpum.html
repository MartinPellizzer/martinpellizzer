                    <h1>Phlebodium sporadocarpum</h1>
<p>Phlebodium sporadocarpum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a thick, fleshy rhizome and large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, which are often covered in a dense, golden-brown coating.</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature contributes to its common name and makes it a popular ornamental plant in humid environments.</p>
