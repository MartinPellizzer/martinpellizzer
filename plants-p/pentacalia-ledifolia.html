                    <h1>Pentacalia ledifolia</h1>
<p>Pentacalia ledifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It grows as a low, compact shrub with branching stems and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Pentacalia ledifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
