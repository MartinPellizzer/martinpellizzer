                    <h1>Panicum viride var. viviparum</h1>
<p>Panicum viride var. viviparum, commonly known as green panic grass, is a variant of the panic grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and the ability to produce viable seeds in its vegetative shoots, a trait known as viviparity. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as lawns, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
