<p>Pinalia pulvinata, commonly known as the cushion pincushion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions.</p>
