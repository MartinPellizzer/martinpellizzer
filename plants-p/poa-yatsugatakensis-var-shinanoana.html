                    <h1>Poa yatsugatakensis var. shinanoana</h1>
<p>Poa yatsugatakensis var. shinanoana, commonly known as the Shinano mountain grass, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems.</p>
