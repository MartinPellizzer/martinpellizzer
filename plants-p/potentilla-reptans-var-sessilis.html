<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticultural settings.</p>
