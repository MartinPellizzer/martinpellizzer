                    <h1>Proselias</h1>
<p>Proselias, commonly known as golden thread, are low-growing evergreen shrubs native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their delicate, thread-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in clusters. Proselias thrive in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Their ornamental value is enhanced by their compact size and ability to form dense mats over time.</p>
