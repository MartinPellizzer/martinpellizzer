                    <h1>Potentilla candicans var. nana</h1>
<p>Potentilla candicans var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish itself in harsh, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The botanical name reflects its close relationship to the species *Potentilla candicans*, with the varietal name *nana* referring to its dwarf stature.</p>
