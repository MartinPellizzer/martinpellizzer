                    <h1>Prunus nana var. rubra</h1>
<p>Prunus nana var. rubra, commonly known as the red dwarf cherry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is valued in both horticultural and ecological settings.</p>
