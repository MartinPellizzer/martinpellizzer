<p>Phegopteris distans, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
