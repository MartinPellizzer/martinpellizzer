                    <h1>Phyllanthus tremulus</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus tremulus, commonly known as trembling sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive, fleshy, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy capsules that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Phyllanthus tremulus is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
