                    <h1>Picea obovata var. tschiketamanica</h1>
<p>Picea obovata var. tschiketamanica, commonly known as the Tsiketamanica fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a distinctive white bloom. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
