                    <h1>Plectopoma × eucodonioides</h1>
<p>Plectopoma × eucodonioides, commonly known as the hybrid moon snail, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Naticidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, smooth, and often iridescent shell, which can vary in color from pale pink to deep purple. This species is typically found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, where it inhabits sandy or muddy substrates. The shell's morphology is adapted for burrowing, allowing the snail to move through soft sediments efficiently.</p>
<p>Its reproductive biology involves internal fertilization, with the female laying eggs in gelatinous masses attached to the substrate.</p>
