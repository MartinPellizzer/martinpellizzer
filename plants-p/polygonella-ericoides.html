                    <h1>Polygonella ericoides</h1>
<p>Polygonella ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf willow or bog willow, is a low-growing shrub native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its small, alternate leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a carpet-like structure that helps stabilize soil in moist, nutrient-poor habitats. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention and protection from harsh weather.</p>
<p>Polygonella ericoides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
