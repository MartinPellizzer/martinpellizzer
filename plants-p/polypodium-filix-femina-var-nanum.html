                    <h1>Polypodium filix-femina var. nanum</h1>
<p>Polypodium filix-femina var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, linear fronds that grow close to the ground, often forming a dense, carpet-like mat. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting.</p>
