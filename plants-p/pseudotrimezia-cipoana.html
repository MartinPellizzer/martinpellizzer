                    <h1>Pseudotrimezia cipoana</h1>
<p>Pseudotrimezia cipoana, commonly known as the Cipoan rock fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific high-altitude regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, lanceolate fronds with a waxy surface, adapted to its arid and rocky environment. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many ferns, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudotrimezia cipoana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
