<p>Psychotria glandulicalyx var. densipubens, commonly known as the dense-hair psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dense pubescence, which covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, ellipsoid berries that are often yellow or orange in color.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological features and potential ecological roles in its native habitat.</p>
