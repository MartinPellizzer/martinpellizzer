<p>Primula nivalis macrophylla, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which provide protection against freezing temperatures and UV radiation.</p>
<p>Primula nivalis macrophylla is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
