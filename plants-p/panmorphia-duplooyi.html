                    <h1>Panmorphia duplooyi</h1>
<p>Panmorphia duplooyi, commonly known as the double-faced fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Its fronds exhibit a dual-faced structure, with one side displaying a typical fern-like appearance and the other side bearing a highly modified, almost floral form. This botanical feature suggests a possible evolutionary adaptation for specific ecological functions, such as pollination or protection. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unusual structure makes it a subject of interest in botanical research and horticultural cultivation.</p>
