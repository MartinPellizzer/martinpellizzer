                    <h1>Phlebodium fulvum</h1>
<p>Phlebodium fulvum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates to anchor its roots. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Phlebodium fulvum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
