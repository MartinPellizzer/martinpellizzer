                    <h1>Pedilonum cyperifolium</h1>
<p>Pedilonum cyperifolium, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats, and it produces tiny, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is typical of the clubmoss family, with a rhizomatous stem system and a unique reproductive cycle involving spores.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>
