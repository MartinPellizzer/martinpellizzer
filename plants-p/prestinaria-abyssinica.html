<p>Prestinaria abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prestinaria abyssinica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
