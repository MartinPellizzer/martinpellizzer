                <h1>Panicum vaginatum</h1>
<p>Panicum vaginatum, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Panicum vaginatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to fluctuating water levels.</p>
