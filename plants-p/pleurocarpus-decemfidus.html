<p>Pleurocarpus decemfidus, commonly known as the ten-lobed fern, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance, often resembling a network of veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions.</p>
