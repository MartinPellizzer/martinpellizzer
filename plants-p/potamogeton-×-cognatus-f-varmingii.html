                    <h1>Potamogeton × cognatus f. varmingii</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × cognatus f. varmingii, commonly known as the Varming's pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it is often found in still or slow-moving waters. Its root system helps stabilize sediment, contributing to water clarity and habitat structure for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptations.</p>
