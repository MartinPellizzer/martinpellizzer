<p>Pellaea articulata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented fronds that give it a zigzag appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait that helps in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
