                    <h1>Potentilla parva</h1>
<p>Potentilla parva, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Potentilla parva is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
