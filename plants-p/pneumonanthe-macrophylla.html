<p>Pneumonanthe macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has long, thick stems that anchor it to the bottom of water bodies, supporting its massive foliage. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom at night and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
