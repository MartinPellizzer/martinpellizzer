<p>Pterostylis loganii, commonly known as the Loganâ€™s ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale green or yellowish flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, primarily thynnid wasps, which are attracted to the orchid's scent.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pterostylis loganii is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation areas.</p>
