<p>Parajubaea, commonly known as the "queen of the palms," is a genus of flowering plants in the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plants are characterized by their tall, slender trunks and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 6 meters in length. Parajubaea species are known for their slow growth and are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance.</p>
<p>However, many species are now considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
