<p>Psiadia punctulata, commonly known as the dotted milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green dot pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Psiadia punctulata is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and contains milky sap, which is typical of the genus.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.</p>
