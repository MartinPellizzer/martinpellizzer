                    <h1>Pinus deodara var. robusta</h1>
<p>Pinus deodara var. robusta, commonly known as the Himalayan blue pine, is a variant of the deodar pine native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking blue-gray in winter. The tree has a tall, slender trunk with a conical shape and exhibits a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its needles are typically longer than those of the standard deodar pine, and it produces cones that are often used in horticulture.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and as a windbreak in colder climates.</p>
