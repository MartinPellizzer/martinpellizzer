                    <h1>Pteris grandis</h1>
<p>Pteris grandis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in wet, humid environments, often found near streams or in shaded, moist areas. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to spread easily in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
