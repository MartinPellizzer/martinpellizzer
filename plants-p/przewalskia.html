                    <h1>Przewalskia</h1>
<p>Przewalskia, commonly known as the Przewalski's horse, is actually a genus of flowering plants, not an animal.</p>
<p>It consists of only two species, Przewalskia tangutica and Przewalskia sinensis, both native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. These plants are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and alternate leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods.</p>
<p>Przewalskia species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing resilience to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
