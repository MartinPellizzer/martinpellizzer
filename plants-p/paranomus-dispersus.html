<p>Paranomus dispersus, commonly known as the scattered fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a light, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Paranomus dispersus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
