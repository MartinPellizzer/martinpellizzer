<p>Polypodiodes microrhizoma, commonly known as the small-rooted fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes that produce clusters of tiny, heart-shaped fronds. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique root system and compact growth habit make it well adapted to its humid, forested habitat.</p>
