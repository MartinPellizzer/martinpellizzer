<p>Phalaroides caesia, commonly known as blue panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple florets. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it both a pioneer species and a potential invasive in some regions.</p>
