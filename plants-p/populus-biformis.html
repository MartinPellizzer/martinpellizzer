                    <h1>Populus biformis</h1>
<p>Populus biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with two prominent lobes, which set it apart from other poplar species. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, often peeling in thin layers as the tree matures.</p>
<p>Populus biformis is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations.</p>
