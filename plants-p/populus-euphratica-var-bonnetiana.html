                    <h1>Populus euphratica var. bonnetiana</h1>
<p>Populus euphratica var. bonnetiana, commonly known as the Bonnet's poplar, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to extreme arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of Central Asia, particularly in the arid and semi-arid zones of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant possesses thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its root system is highly developed to access deep groundwater. It is often found growing in saline soils and can tolerate high levels of soil salinity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for studying plant adaptation to harsh climates.</p>
