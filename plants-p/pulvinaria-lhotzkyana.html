                    <h1>Pulvinaria lhotzkyana</h1>
<p>Pulvinaria lhotzkyana, commonly known as the lhotzkyana scale, is a species of armored scale insect native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, shield-like body that covers and protects its soft, fleshy body underneath. The plant it infests, typically a host species such as a species of Ficus, serves as both a food source and a habitat for the insect. The scale's feeding activities can cause significant damage to the host plant, leading to yellowing leaves, stunted growth, and in severe cases, plant death.</p>
<p>This insect is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host plants thrive.</p>
