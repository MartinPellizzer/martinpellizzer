<p>Pleurothallis sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. It is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
