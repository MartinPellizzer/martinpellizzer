<p>Polypodium albobrunneum, commonly known as the yellow fern, is a species of fern native to various parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
