<p>Polystichum mickelii, commonly known as Mickel's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, dense fronds that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Polystichum mickelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>
