                    <h1>Psilotrichum africanum f. intermedium</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum africanum f. intermedium, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching and the presence of microphylls, which are small, scale-like leaves. The plant lacks true roots and has a rhizome that serves as an underground stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, contributing to its role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
