<p>Pulicaria undulata subsp.</p>
<p>argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping and is valued for its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
