<p>Pedicularis ornithorhynchos, commonly known as the hummingbird orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that resemble the beak of a hummingbird. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant red or orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
