                    <h1>Phoradendron quascanum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron quascanum, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for attachment to the host. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>The plant's life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an ecologically significant component of forest ecosystems.</p>
