                    <h1>Potentilla cernavodae-taurica</h1>
<p>Potentilla cernavodae-taurica, commonly known as the Crimean potentilla, is a rare shrub native to the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native region. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
