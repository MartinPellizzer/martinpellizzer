                    <h1>Pharium</h1>
<p>Pharium, commonly known as the "blue bell" or "blue orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plants are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with intricate patterns. Pharium species typically grow as terrestrial herbs or small shrubs, and they thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and their role in the ecological diversity of their native habitats.</p>
