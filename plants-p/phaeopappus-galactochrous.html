                    <h1>Phaeopappus galactochrous</h1>
<p>Phaeopappus galactochrous, commonly known as the golden-hued pappus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, velvety texture. Its fruit is a small, hairy capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
