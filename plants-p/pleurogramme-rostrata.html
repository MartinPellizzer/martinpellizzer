                    <h1>Pleurogramme rostrata</h1>
<p>Pleurogramme rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated pleurogramme, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often in shaded environments. Its spores are released into the water, allowing for dispersal and propagation.</p>
<p>The botanical structure of Pleurogramme rostrata reflects its adaptation to aquatic life, with specialized tissues for buoyancy and nutrient absorption.</p>
