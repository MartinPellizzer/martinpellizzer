                    <h1>Prunus × lannesiana f. sericea</h1>
<p>Prunus × lannesiana f. sericea, commonly known as the silvery leaf cherry, is a unique cultivar characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is a hybrid between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus × yedoensis, resulting in a blend of traits from both parent species. The foliage exhibits a distinctive velvety texture and a shimmering appearance due to the dense pubescence on the leaf surfaces. It is typically grown as a small tree or shrub, valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible cherries that are smaller than those of typical cherry trees.</p>
