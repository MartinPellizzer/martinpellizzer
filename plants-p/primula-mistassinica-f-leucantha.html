                    <h1>Primula mistassinica f. leucantha</h1>
<p>Primula mistassinica f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered mountain primrose, is a rare and striking variant of the mountain primrose native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Canada.</p>
<p>This cultivar is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical pink or purple hues of the species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is considered a valuable addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
