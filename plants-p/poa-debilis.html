                    <h1>Poa debilis</h1>
<p>Poa debilis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate varying levels of moisture.</p>
<p>Poa debilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
