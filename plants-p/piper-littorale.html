<p>Piper littorale, commonly known as the salt marsh pepper or coastal pepper, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, adapting to high levels of salt in its environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its leaves are often heart-shaped with a rough texture. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Piper littorale is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
