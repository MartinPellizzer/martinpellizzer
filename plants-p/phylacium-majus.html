                    <h1>Phylacium majus</h1>
<p>Phylacium majus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving water bodies. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom in the early morning and open fully by midday.</p>
<p>Phylacium majus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
