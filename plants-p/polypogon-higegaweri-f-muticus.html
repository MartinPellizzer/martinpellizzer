                    <h1>Polypogon higegaweri f. muticus</h1>
<p>Polypogon higegaweri f. muticus, commonly known as the silent higegaweri grass, is a rare and lesser-known grass species belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils or rocky areas, preferring full sun exposure. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, which is often reduced in size compared to other members of the genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and genetic diversity.</p>
