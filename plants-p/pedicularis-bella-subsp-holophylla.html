<p>Pedicularis bella subsp.</p>
<p>holophylla, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. This semi-epiphytic plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling the fur of a monkey, hence its common name.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rock faces or in shaded forest environments, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and flies.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, making it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
