<p>Papaver alpinum subsp.</p>
<p>degenii, commonly known as the Alpine poppy, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
