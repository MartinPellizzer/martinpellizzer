                    <h1>Peltopus lophotos</h1>
<p>Peltopus lophotos, commonly known as the mountain lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forest floors, rock surfaces, and tree trunks. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its partners for nutrients and photosynthesis. Its structure allows it to absorb moisture and minerals from the environment efficiently.</p>
<p>Peltopus lophotos plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
