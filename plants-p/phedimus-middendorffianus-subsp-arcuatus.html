<p>Phedimus middendorffianus subsp.</p>
<p>arcuatus, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or semi-arid habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xerophytic landscapes.</p>
