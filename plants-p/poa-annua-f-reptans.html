                    <h1>Poa annua f. reptans</h1>
<p>Poa annua f. reptans, commonly known as creeping annual bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass that spreads via stolons, creating dense, uniform turf. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue-green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a desirable turfgrass and a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
