                    <h1>Phalacraea wendlandii</h1>
<p>Phalacraea wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude grasslands of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, pale violet or white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
