                    <h1>Parapolystichum hornei</h1>
<p>Parapolystichum hornei, commonly known as the Horne's sword fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polystichaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and lance-shaped. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
