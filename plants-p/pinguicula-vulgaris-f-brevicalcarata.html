                    <h1>Pinguicula vulgaris f. brevicalcarata</h1>
<p>Pinguicula vulgaris f. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-stalked butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations for nutrient absorption, it is a fascinating example of plant evolution in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
