<p>Puccinellia lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Puccinellia lemmonii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in restoration projects.</p>
