<p>Plantago tomentosa var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with dense, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spikes. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in crevices and poor soils.</p>
<p>This variant is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
