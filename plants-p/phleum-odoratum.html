                    <h1>Phleum odoratum</h1>
<p>Phleum odoratum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and bright yellow-green inflorescences. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it often grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and pastures. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive, slightly hairy texture, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Phleum odoratum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
