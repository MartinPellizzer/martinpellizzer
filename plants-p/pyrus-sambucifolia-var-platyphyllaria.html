<p>Pyrus sambucifolia var. platyphyllaria, commonly known as the broad-leafed whitebeam, is a variant of the whitebeam tree native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically larger and more flattened than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to support local wildlife.</p>
