<p>Polystichum decoratum subsp.</p>
<p>decoratum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with a silvery or whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
