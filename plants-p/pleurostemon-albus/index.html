                            <h1>Pleurostemon Albus</h1>
<p>White pleurostemon, scientifically known as Pleurostemon albus, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Despite its delicate appearance, this species is highly resilient, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Its unique beauty has made it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike. However, due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its natural range.</p>
