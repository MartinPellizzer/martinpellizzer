<p>Pinus pseudostrobus subsp.</p>
<p>coatepecensis, commonly known as the Coatepec pine, is a rare subspecies native to the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca in Mexico. It is a tall evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves and a conical shape.</p>
<p>The tree produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, a common reproductive strategy among pines. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
