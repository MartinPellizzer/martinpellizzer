<p>Pronephrium inaequilobatum, commonly known as the irregular lobed kidney fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical fronds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include a rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically bipinnate with irregularly spaced pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are covered in a dense layer of sori, which are clustered along the margins of the pinnae.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its unique morphology, which sets it apart from other members of the Pronephrium genus.</p>
