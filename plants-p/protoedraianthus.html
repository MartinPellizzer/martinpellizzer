                    <h1>Protoedraianthus</h1>
<p>Protoedraianthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter. It is often found growing epiphytically on trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Protoedraianthus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
