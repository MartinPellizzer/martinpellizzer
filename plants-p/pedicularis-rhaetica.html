                    <h1>Pedicularis rhaetica</h1>
<p>Pedicularis rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a distinctive spurred petal that attracts pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
