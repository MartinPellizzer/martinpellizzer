<p>Polypodium selliguea var. normale, commonly known as the common wall fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that often grow on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture and traditional medicine.</p>
