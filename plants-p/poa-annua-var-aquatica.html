                    <h1>Poa annua var. aquatica</h1>
<p>Poa annua var. aquatica, commonly known as water annual bluegrass, is a variant of the common annual bluegrass that thrives in wet or aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. This plant typically forms dense mats on the surface of wetlands, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
