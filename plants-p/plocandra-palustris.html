                    <h1>Plocandra palustris</h1>
<p>Plocandra palustris, commonly known as the marsh plocandra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
