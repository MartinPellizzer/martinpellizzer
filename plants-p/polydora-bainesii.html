<p>Polydora bainesii, commonly known as the Baines' ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, ghost-like appearance, with translucent petals and a slender, erect stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts focus on protecting its fragile ecosystem and preventing further habitat loss.</p>
