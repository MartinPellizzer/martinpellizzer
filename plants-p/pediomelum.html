                    <h1>Pediomelum</h1>
<p>Pediomelum, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with rocky or sandy soils. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of hairy, lobed leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. Pediomelum species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>They are not widely cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
