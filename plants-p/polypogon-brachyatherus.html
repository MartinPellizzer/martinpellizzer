<p>Polypogon brachyatherus, commonly known as the narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like blades with a distinctive blue-gray sheen, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its spread in wetland habitats.</p>
