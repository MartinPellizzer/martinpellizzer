                    <h1>Pseudotrimezia truncata</h1>
<p>Pseudotrimezia truncata, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily rimu and kahikatea, through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis to some extent. It produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for native birds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pseudotrimezia truncata is considered vulnerable and is protected in many areas of New Zealand.</p>
