                    <h1>Psacalium cervinum</h1>
<p>Psacalium cervinum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its native range.</p>
