                    <h1>Phlox stolonifera var. crassifolia</h1>
<p>Phlox stolonifera var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf phlox, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground covers.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick mats, which help suppress weeds and prevent erosion.</p>
