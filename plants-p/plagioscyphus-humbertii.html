<p>Plagioscyphus humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with bright yellow petals and a distinctive violet lip, which attract specific pollinators. It thrives in rocky crevices and requires well-drained soil and minimal water, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plagioscyphus humbertii is considered an endangered plant, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
