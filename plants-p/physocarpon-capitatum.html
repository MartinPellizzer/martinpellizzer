<p>Physocarpon capitatum, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which help it float and facilitate gas exchange. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its flowering stems bear small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Physocarpon capitatum is often found in nutrient-rich waters and is an indicator of stable, unpolluted aquatic habitats.</p>
