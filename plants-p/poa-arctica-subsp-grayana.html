<p>Poa arctica subsp.</p>
<p>grayana, commonly known as Arctic gray hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of Arctic ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
