<p>Panicum platense, commonly known as flatseeder grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
