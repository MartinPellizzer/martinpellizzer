                    <h1>Phaeopappus saxatilis</h1>
<p>Phaeopappus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock phaeopappus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in crevices and access moisture from deep within the soil.</p>
<p>Phaeopappus saxatilis is well adapted to harsh, semi-desert conditions and is often found in mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
