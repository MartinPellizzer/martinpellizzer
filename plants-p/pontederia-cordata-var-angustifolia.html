                    <h1>Pontederia cordata var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Pontederia cordata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in spikes above the water. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective indicator of nutrient-rich aquatic environments.</p>
