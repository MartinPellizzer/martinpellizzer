                    <h1>Phenax pallida</h1>
<p>Phenax pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking white, orchid-like flowers that bloom on slender, hairless stems. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. Its delicate structure and elusive nature have made it a subject of both scientific study and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Phenax pallida is listed as an endangered species.</p>
