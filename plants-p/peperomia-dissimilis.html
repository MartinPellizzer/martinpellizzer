                    <h1>Peperomia dissimilis</h1>
<p>Peperomia dissimilis, commonly known as the silver peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, with a textured surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Peperomia dissimilis is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage.</p>
