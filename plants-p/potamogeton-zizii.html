<p>Potamogeton zizii, commonly known as the Zizy watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Potamogeton zizii is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
