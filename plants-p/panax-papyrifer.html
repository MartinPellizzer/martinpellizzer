<p>Panax papyrifer, commonly known as the paper-leaf ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves that resemble paper in texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Due to its medicinal properties and limited distribution, it is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from further decline.</p>
