                    <h1>Pinacopodium</h1>
<p>Pinacopodium, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, mat-forming growth habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plants typically have small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. Pinacopodium species are adapted to harsh environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>They are often used in traditional medicine and are of interest in ecological studies due to their resilience in dry climates.</p>
