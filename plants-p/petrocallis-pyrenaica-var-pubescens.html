<p>Petrocallis pyrenaica var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, calcareous substrates, often found in mountainous regions with limited soil. The plant has a compact growth form with short, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are usually covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution.</p>
