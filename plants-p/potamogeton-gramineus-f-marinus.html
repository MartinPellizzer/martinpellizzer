                    <h1>Potamogeton gramineus f. marinus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton gramineus f. marinus, commonly known as the marine pondweed, is a variant of the water plantain found in brackish and coastal waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant thrives in saline environments, making it an important component of estuarine ecosystems. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its ability to spread in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This form is adapted to tolerate varying salinity levels, which allows it to flourish in transitional zones between freshwater and marine environments.</p>
