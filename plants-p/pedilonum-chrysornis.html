<p>Pedilonum chrysornis, commonly known as the golden-feathered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers that resemble feathers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and vibrant coloration make it a sought-after species among botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Pedilonum chrysornis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
