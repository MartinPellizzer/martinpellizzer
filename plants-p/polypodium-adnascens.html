<p>Polypodium adnascens, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb on rocks and trees. The fronds are typically divided into lanceolate segments with a serrated margin. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are released from small, fleshy sporangia located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
