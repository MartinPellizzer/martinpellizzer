                    <h1>Pistacia subfalcata</h1>
<p>Pistacia subfalcata, commonly known as the desert pistache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3â€“5 inches long and have a distinctive, narrow, sickle-shaped leaflet. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, kidney-shaped nuts enclosed in a rough, woody husk. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes.</p>
