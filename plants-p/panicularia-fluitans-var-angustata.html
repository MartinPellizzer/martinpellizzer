                    <h1>Panicularia fluitans var. angustata</h1>
<p>Panicularia fluitans var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved floating panicled grass, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, floating stems that allow it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences called paniculae, which give it its common name. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted for buoyancy and photosynthesis in water.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
