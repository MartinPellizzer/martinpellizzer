                    <h1>Phymatosorus membranifolius</h1>
<p>Phymatosorus membranifolius, commonly known as the membranous fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
