                    <h1>Plantago phaeopus</h1>
<p>Plantago phaeopus, commonly known as the black plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosette of dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams.</p>
<p>The seeds of Plantago phaeopus are encased in a hard, spiky shell, which aids in their dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing.</p>
