                    <h1>Pedicularis acaulis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis acaulis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
