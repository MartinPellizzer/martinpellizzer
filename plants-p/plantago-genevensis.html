                    <h1>Plantago genevensis</h1>
<p>Plantago genevensis, commonly known as the Geneva plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, helmet-like structure called an elaiosome, which aids in seed dispersal by ants.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
