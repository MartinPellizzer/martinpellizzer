                    <h1>Puccinellia arctica</h1>
<p>Puccinellia arctica, commonly known as Arctic grass or polar grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is a key component of tundra vegetation.</p>
<p>Puccinellia arctica is also valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
