                    <h1>Parrotia</h1>
<p>Parrotia, commonly known as the parrotia tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble parrot beaks, hence its common name. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that turn a brilliant red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Parrotia is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
