                    <h1>Ptychococcus archboldianus var. microchlamys</h1>
<p>Ptychococcus archboldianus var. microchlamys, commonly known as the dwarf chlamys lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, flattened, leaf-like structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. The thallus is composed of a dense layer of fungal hyphae intertwined with algae, which provide the photosynthetic function. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in humid, low-light environments.</p>
<p>Its morphology and ecological niche make it a unique subject for botanical study.</p>
