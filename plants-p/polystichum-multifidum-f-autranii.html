<p>Polystichum multifidum f. autranii, commonly known as the Autran's hart's-tongue fern, is a fern species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
