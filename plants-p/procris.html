                    <h1>Procris</h1>
<p>Procris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and lacks leaves, relying entirely on its roots for survival. The plant is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique ability to absorb nutrients through its roots from the air. Procris thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
