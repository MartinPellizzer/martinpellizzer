<p>Polygala glacialis, commonly known as the alpine milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Polygala glacialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
