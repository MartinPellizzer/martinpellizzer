<p>Phaseolus vulgaris var. fuscoviolaceus, commonly known as the dark violet pole bean, is a variant of the common bean species characterized by its deep violet to almost black pod coloration.</p>

<p>Its distinctive color makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking visual interest in their landscapes.</p>
