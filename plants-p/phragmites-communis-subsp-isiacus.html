<p>Phragmites communis subsp.</p>
<p>isiacus, commonly known as the narrowleaf common reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetlands across North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes, lakeshores, and tidal areas. Its rhizomes spread extensively, allowing it to dominate wetland ecosystems and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
