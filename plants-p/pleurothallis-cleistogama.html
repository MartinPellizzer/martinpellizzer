                    <h1>Pleurothallis cleistogama</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis cleistogama, commonly known as the closed-flower orchid, is a species native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often hidden flowers that are typically pollinated by specific insects. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish flowers that are usually cleistogamous, meaning they remain closed and self-pollinate. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>The orchid's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its native habitat.</p>
