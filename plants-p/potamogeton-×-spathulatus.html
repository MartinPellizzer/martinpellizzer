                    <h1>Potamogeton × spathulatus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has broad, flat leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit genetic variability and adaptability to different water conditions.</p>
