<p>Primula ambita, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of white or pale pink petals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Primula ambita is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
