                    <h1>Polystichum falcatum</h1>
<p>Polystichum falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated, and often serrated fronds that grow in a dense, upright cluster. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
