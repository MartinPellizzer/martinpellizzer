                    <h1>Panicum linkii</h1>
<p>Panicum linkii, commonly known as silver panicum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brown florets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens.</p>
