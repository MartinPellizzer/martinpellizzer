<p>Polypodium pleuridioides, commonly known as the pleuridioid fern, is a tropical fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
