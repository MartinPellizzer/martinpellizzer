<p>Phyllanthus rotundatus, commonly known as the roundleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its fleshy, rounded leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Phyllanthus rotundatus is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
