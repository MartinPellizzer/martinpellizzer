                    <h1>Potamogeton × fluitans f. brevifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × fluitans f. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its reduced leaf size compared to its parent species.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has long, flexible stems that are often submerged, with small, narrow leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in many pondweeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological studies due to its role in aquatic ecosystems and its ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions.</p>
