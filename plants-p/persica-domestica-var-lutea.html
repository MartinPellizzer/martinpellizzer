<p>Persica domestica var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow peach.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange fruit flesh, which sets it apart from the more common white or yellow peaches. The flowers are typically larger and more showy than those of standard peaches, often with a more intense pink hue. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fruit color.</p>
<p>The plant shares the same growth habits as other peaches, including a deciduous nature and a preference for well-drained, fertile soil.</p>
