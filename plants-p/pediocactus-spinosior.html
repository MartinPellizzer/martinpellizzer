<p>Pediocactus spinosior, commonly known as the spiny pediocactus, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid landscapes.</p>
