<p>Photinia micrantha, commonly known as the small-fruited firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy winter berries.</p>
