<p>Phragmites australis f. pilifer, commonly known as the silky reed, is a variant of the common reed that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, lakeshores, and riverbanks. The plant is notable for its soft, silky hairs covering the leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other forms of Phragmites. It produces dense clusters of fluffy, feathery flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife.</p>
