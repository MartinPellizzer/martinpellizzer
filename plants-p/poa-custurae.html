                    <h1>Poa custurae</h1>
<p>Poa custurae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with florets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Poa custurae is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
