<p>Parodia weberiana, commonly known as the Weber's pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular shape and dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are often visited by nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
