                    <h1>Populus glandulosa</h1>
<p>Populus glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with glandular dots along the veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>The glandular structures on its leaves and stems are thought to play a role in chemical defense against herbivores.</p>
