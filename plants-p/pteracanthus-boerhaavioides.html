<p>Pteracanthus boerhaavioides, commonly known as the Boerhaave's pteracanthus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds through wind or water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
