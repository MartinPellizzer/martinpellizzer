                    <h1>Petrocosmea chiwui</h1>
<p>Petrocosmea chiwui, commonly known as the Chiwu rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, violet-blue petals with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops, adapting to nutrient-poor and well-drained substrates. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Petrocosmea chiwui is considered a conservation concern.</p>
