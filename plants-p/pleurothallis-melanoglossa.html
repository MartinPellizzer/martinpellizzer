                    <h1>Pleurothallis melanoglossa</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis melanoglossa, commonly known as the black-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>This orchid is often epiphytic, growing on trees rather than in soil, and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
