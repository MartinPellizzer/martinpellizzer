                    <h1>Pinus pumilio var. gibba</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio var. gibba, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, twisted trunk, adapted to harsh mountain environments. Its needles are typically clustered in bundles of five, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. The leaves are dark green and remain on the tree for several years before shedding.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, dry climates and is often found in alpine regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
