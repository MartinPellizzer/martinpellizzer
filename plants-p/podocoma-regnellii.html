                    <h1>Podocoma regnellii</h1>
<p>Podocoma regnellii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Podocoma regnellii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
