                    <h1>Polypleurum wallichii var. parvum</h1>
<p>Polypleurum wallichii var. parvum, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a variety of the rock fern genus Polypleurum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Asia. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats on rocky or forested ground.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a typical feature of the fern family.</p>
