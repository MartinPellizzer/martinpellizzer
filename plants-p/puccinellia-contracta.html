<p>Puccinellia contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of salt desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important forage plant for livestock in dryland environments.</p>
