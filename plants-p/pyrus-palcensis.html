                    <h1>Pyrus palcensis</h1>
<p>Pyrus palcensis, commonly known as the ancient pear, is a rare and extinct species of the pear genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits with a smooth, thin skin. The plant likely had a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves in the autumn season. Its flowers were probably white or pale yellow, typical of many pear species.</p>
<p>Due to its extinction, very little is known about its full botanical characteristics and ecological role.</p>
