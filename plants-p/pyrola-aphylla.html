                    <h1>Pyrola aphylla</h1>
<p>Pyrola aphylla, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the moist, shaded forests of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in late spring, which are often hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions.</p>
