<p>Pharbitis githaginea, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions make it both a useful plant and a potential weed.</p>
