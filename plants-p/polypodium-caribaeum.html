<p>Polypodium caribaeum, commonly known as the Carib rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium caribaeum plays an important role in the ecological balance of tropical rainforests by contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
