<p>Pedicularis grigorjevii, commonly known as the Siberian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
