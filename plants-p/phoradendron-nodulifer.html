                    <h1>Phoradendron nodulifer</h1>
<p>Phoradendron nodulifer, commonly known as the nodular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its leaves are usually small, elliptical, and arranged in pairs along the stems.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its distinctive nodular growths, which give it its common name.</p>
