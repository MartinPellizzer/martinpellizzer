                    <h1>Polypodium subauriculatum var. serratifolium</h1>
<p>Polypodium subauriculatum var. serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated-leaf polypody, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated leaflets that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
