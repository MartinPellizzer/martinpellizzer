The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures are hidden within the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
