                    <h1>Plantago aitchisonii</h1>
<p>Plantago aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's plantain, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
