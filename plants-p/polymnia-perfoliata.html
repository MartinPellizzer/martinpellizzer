                    <h1>Polymnia perfoliata</h1>
<p>Polymnia perfoliata, commonly known as the leafy bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded woodland areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in herbal remedies, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role.</p>
