                    <h1>Phoradendron xanthophyllum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron xanthophyllum, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected off the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves both vegetative growth and seed dispersal, with seeds often passing through the digestive systems of birds.</p>
<p>The yellow mistletoe is an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing host tree health and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
