<p>Pyracantha discolor, commonly known as the variable firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that range in color from dark green to reddish-brown. The plant produces clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but are considered toxic to humans and livestock.</p>
<p>Pyracantha discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its vibrant winter berries and thorny structure.</p>
