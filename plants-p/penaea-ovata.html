<p>It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in shallow water habitats.</p>
<p>Penaea ovata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
