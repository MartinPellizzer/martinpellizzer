                    <h1>Potentilla argentea subvar. perincisa</h1>
<p>Potentilla argentea subvar. perincisa, commonly known as silver potentilla or silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
