                    <h1>Phegopteris lineata</h1>
<p>Phegopteris lineata, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are divided into small, linear segments, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>The veined shield fern is a valuable component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
