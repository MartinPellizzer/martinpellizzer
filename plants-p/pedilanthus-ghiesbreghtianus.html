<p>Pedilanthus ghiesbreghtianus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, orchid-like appearance with delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its thick, fleshy stems for photosynthesis and water storage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
