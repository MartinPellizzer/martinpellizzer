                    <h1>Pteracanthus botryanthus</h1>
<p>Pteracanthus botryanthus, commonly known as the star-shaped leaf fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its unique foliage.</p>
<p>It features broad, wavy, and often star-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, followed by spherical, spore-bearing fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it an interesting subject for studying fern morphology and adaptation to moist, low-light conditions.</p>
