                    <h1>Pitcairnia poortmanii</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia poortmanii, commonly known as the Poortman's pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia poortmanii is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
