                    <h1>Phragmites australis var. berlandieri</h1>
<p>Phragmites australis var. berlandieri, commonly known as the western common reed, is a tall, perennial grass found primarily in wetland habitats across North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense stands of hollow, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variant is adapted to a wide range of moisture conditions, from freshwater to brackish environments. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly and dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
