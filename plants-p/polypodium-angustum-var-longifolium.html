                    <h1>Polypodium angustum var. longifolium</h1>
<p>Polypodium angustum var. longifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its slender, elongated fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China and Japan. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is primarily based on the length and shape of its foliage compared to the typical form of *Polypodium angustum*.</p>
