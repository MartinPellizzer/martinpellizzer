                    <h1>Potamogeton × harzii</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × harzii, commonly known as the hybrid watermilfoil, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton praelatus.</p>
<p>It is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can significantly impact aquatic ecosystems.</p>
