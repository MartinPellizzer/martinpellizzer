                    <h1>Potentilla anserina f. sericea</h1>
<p>Potentilla anserina f. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with silver-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
