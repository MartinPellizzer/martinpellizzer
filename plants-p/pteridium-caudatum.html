                    <h1>Pteridium caudatum</h1>
<p>Pteridium caudatum, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a large, coarse fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and disturbed soils. Its rhizomes are robust and creeping, allowing it to spread aggressively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures.</p>
