                    <h1>Pinus pumilio var. revoluta</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio var. revoluta, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and dense, sprawling crown, which provides habitat for various wildlife species. The tree's needles are typically blue-green in color and grow in bundles of five, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the tree for many years, a feature that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This variant is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in cold, dry conditions with well-drained soils.</p>
