                    <h1>Polypodium vacciniifolium</h1>
<p>Polypodium vacciniifolium, commonly known as the cranberry fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the leaves of cranberries, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and early summer.</p>
