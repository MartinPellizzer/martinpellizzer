                    <h1>Poa compressa var. arenosa</h1>
<p>Poa compressa var. arenosa, commonly known as the sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It has narrow, blue-green leaves that are tightly rolled when dry, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to harsh, wind-swept conditions and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, saline soils makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
