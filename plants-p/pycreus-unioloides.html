                    <h1>Pycreus unioloides</h1>
<p>Pycreus unioloides, commonly known as the slender marsh clubmoss, is a small evergreen herbaceous plant native to moist, acidic environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Pycreus unioloides thrives in shaded, wet habitats such as bogs and swampy areas, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
