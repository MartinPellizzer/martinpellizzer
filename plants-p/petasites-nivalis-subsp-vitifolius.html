<p>Petasites nivalis subsp.</p>
<p>vitifolius, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in early spring, typically clustered in a panicle-like structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it plays an important role in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
