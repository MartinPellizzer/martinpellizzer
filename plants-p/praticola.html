                    <h1>Praticola</h1>
<p>Praticola, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of toothed, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flowering head. The flowers are yellow and produce a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism known as a pappus, which allows the seeds to be carried by the wind. Praticola is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
