                    <h1>Planchonia</h1>
<p>Planchonia, commonly known as the kauri tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, primarily found in tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>These trees are characterized by their tall, straight trunks and broad, feather-like leaves. They play a significant role in their native ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity. Planchonia species are also valued for their durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, many species face threats due to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
