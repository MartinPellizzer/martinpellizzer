<p>Pneumonanthe clausa, commonly known as the closed lung plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant's leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is known for its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pneumonanthe clausa is considered an endangered species.</p>
