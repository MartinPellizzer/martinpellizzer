<p>Phelypaea ramosa subsp.</p>
<p>spissa, commonly known as the dense-stemmed fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit with densely packed, lanceolate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role as an indicator species for humid, low-light ecosystems.</p>
