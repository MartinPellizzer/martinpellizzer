                    <h1>Psidium monticola var. gracile</h1>
<p>Psidium monticola var. gracile, commonly known as the small pineapple guava, is a variant of the pineapple guava native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale pink, followed by edible berries similar to those of the common pineapple guava. Its leaves are ovate, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The fruit is generally smaller and less aromatic than the typical pineapple guava, but it is still valued for its sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
