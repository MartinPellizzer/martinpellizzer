<p>Palmeria, commonly known as the "sea holly," is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Palmeria grows in low, compact shrubs, often forming dense mats along rocky shores and sandy beaches.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important part of coastal ecosystems and a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
