                    <h1>Pedilonum mohlianum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum mohlianum, commonly known as the Mohlian's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, aiding its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
