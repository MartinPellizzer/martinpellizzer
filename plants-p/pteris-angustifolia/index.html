                            <h1>Pteris Angustifolia</h1>
<p>Narrow-leaf brake, scientifically known as Pteris angustifolia, is a hardy fern native to various regions across Asia and the Americas. This plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, upright cluster. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Pteris angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its unique structure and resilience make it a popular choice for both gardeners and botanists alike.</p>
