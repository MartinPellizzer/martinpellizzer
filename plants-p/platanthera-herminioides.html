                    <h1>Platanthera herminioides</h1>
<p>Platanthera herminioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and long, spiraled inflorescences that bear numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, often near streams or in swampy areas. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, it is considered a species of concern in many regions.</p>
