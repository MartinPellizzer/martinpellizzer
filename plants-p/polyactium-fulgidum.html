<p>Polyactium fulgidum, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a member of the family Polytrichaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, cushion-like growth form with bright yellow-green leaves that are often curled at the tips.
