                    <h1>Pinguicula vulgaris var. obtusata</h1>
<p>Pinguicula vulgaris var. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, arranged in a spike above the leaves.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its nutrition through insect prey.</p>
