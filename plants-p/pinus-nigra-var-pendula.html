                    <h1>Pinus nigra var. pendula</h1>
<p>Pinus nigra var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping black pine, is a striking evergreen conifer characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect.</p>
<p>Native to the Mediterranean region, this variety of pine tree is known for its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters. It typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters, with a broad, rounded crown that becomes more pendulous with age. The tree produces cones that mature in the second year, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure.</p>
