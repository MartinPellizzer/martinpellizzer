The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
