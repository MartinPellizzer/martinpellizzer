                    <h1>Pseudolysimachion spurium</h1>
<p>Pseudolysimachion spurium, commonly known as the spiked lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, often in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
