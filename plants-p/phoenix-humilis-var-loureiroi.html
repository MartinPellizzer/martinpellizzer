                    <h1>Phoenix humilis var. loureiroi</h1>
<p>Phoenix humilis var. loureiroi, commonly known as the dwarf date palm, is a small, ornamental palm native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature, typically reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with a dense, fan-shaped crown of dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible dates, although the fruit is generally not as large or sweet as those of other date palm varieties. It thrives in warm, arid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
