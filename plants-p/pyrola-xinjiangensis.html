                    <h1>Pyrola xinjiangensis</h1>
<p>Pyrola xinjiangensis, commonly known as the Xinjiang pyrola, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Xinjiang, China, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, leathery leaves and bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. It is adapted to high-altitude conditions and has a limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and potential threats from environmental changes, Pyrola xinjiangensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
