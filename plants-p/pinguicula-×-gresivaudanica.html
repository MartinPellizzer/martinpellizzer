                    <h1>Pinguicula × gresivaudanica</h1>
<p>Pinguicula × gresivaudanica, commonly known as the hybrid butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pinguicula lutea and Pinguicula ionandra, exhibiting traits from both parents. The plant features small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing delicate yellow or green flowers.</p>
