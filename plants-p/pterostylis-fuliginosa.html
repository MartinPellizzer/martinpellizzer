                    <h1>Pterostylis fuliginosa</h1>
<p>Pterostylis fuliginosa, commonly known as the smoky helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, hood-like flower that is often tinged with a smoky or purplish hue. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by the orchid's strong, often unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>The orchid's morphology is adapted to its specific ecological niche, with specialized structures that facilitate its unique pollination strategy.</p>
