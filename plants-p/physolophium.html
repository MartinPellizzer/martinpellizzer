                    <h1>Physolophium</h1>
<p>Physolophium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique, bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, forested areas. Its botanical features include a slender stem, small white petals, and an unusual root system that helps it absorb nutrients from poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Physolophium is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
