<p>Polygonum aviculare subsp.</p>
<p>calcatum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is adaptable to a variety of soil types.</p>
