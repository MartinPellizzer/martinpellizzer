                    <h1>Polystichopsis puberula</h1>
<p>Polystichopsis puberula, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
