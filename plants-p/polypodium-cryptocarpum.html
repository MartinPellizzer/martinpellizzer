                    <h1>Polypodium cryptocarpum</h1>
<p>Polypodium cryptocarpum, commonly known as the hidden-fruit fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow on trees or rocks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore cases called sporangia, which are typically hidden beneath the fronds, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>Polypodium cryptocarpum thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest areas.</p>
