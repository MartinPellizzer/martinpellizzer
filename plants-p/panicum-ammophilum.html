                    <h1>Panicum ammophilum</h1>
<p>Panicum ammophilum, commonly known as beach panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well adapted to beach environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous light green to brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This hardy species plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas.</p>
