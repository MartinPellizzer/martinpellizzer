                    <h1>Potamogeton pauciflorus var. niagarensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton pauciflorus var. niagarensis, commonly known as the Niagara pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often ribbon-like in shape. It produces tiny, clustered flowers that are pollinated by wind or water.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Potamogeton pauciflorus.</p>
