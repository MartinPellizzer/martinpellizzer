                    <h1>Psiadia hendersoniae</h1>
<p>Psiadia hendersoniae, commonly known as the Henderson's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its unique ecological role in the Hawaiian ecosystem makes it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
