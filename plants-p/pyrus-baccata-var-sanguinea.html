The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, supporting a range of wildlife.</p>
