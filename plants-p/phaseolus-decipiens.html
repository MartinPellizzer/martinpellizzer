                    <h1>Phaseolus decipiens</h1>
<p>Phaseolus decipiens, commonly known as the false pinto bean, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is often mistaken for other Phaseolus species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
