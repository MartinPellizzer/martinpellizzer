                    <h1>Pisum coerulescens</h1>
<p>Pisum coerulescens, commonly known as the blue pea, is a rare and unique legume species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue flowers, which are unusually pigmented due to the presence of delphinidin, a type of anthocyanin. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain seeds used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its botanical features include trifoliate leaves and a climbing habit, typical of many leguminous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
