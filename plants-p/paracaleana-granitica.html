                    <h1>Paracaleana granitica</h1>
<p>Paracaleana granitica, commonly known as the granite rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant endemic to specific rocky habitats in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers that are typically pale green or yellow in color. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils found on granite outcrops. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in harsh, sun-exposed environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
