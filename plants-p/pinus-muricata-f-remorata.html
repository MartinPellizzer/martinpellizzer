                    <h1>Pinus muricata f. remorata</h1>
<p>Pinus muricata f. remorata, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a unique variant of the coastal pinon pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scaly bark and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical species. This form is adapted to arid and coastal environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and salt resistance. It produces small, edible cones that contain seeds used by local wildlife and humans.</p>
<p>The plant's slow growth and longevity make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
