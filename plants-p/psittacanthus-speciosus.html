<p>Psittacanthus speciosus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense, compact growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that have a distinctive golden hue along the midrib. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
