<p>Potamogeton obtusifolius, commonly known as broadleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It has long, flexible stems that often grow in dense mats along the bottom of lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are broad, oval, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss and provides buoyancy. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters.</p>
