<p>Pappostipa atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Pappostipa atacamensis plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest for its resilience to extreme conditions.</p>
