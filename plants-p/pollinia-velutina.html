                    <h1>Pollinia velutina</h1>
<p>Pollinia velutina, commonly known as the velvet spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy structures called pollinia, which are specialized for seed dispersal. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Pollinia velutina is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and pollination mechanisms.</p>
