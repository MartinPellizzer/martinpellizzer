<p>Physoceras rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant has rounded, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, often spreading via runners.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
