                    <h1>Plagiobothrys figuratus var. corallicarpus</h1>
<p>Plagiobothrys figuratus var. corallicarpus, commonly known as the coral fruit flax, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking coral-pink to red fruits that remain on the plant for an extended period. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open woodland or chaparral habitats. It produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, fleshy, coral-colored fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
