                    <h1>Padellus</h1>
<p>Padellus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique structure, with a single, slender stem and no true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found growing on the trunks of cypress trees.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Padellus is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
