                    <h1>Phelipanche lainzii</h1>
<p>Phelipanche lainzii, commonly known as the Spanish broom weed, is an annual parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of various crops and wild plants. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers and has a slender, branching stem. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years, making it a persistent weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of its host plants.</p>
