<p>Prosopis piurensis, commonly known as the Puya tree, is a species of legume native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, compound leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated pods containing small, hard seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in semi-arid and desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
