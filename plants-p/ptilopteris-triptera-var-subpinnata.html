                    <h1>Ptilopteris triptera var. subpinnata</h1>
<p>Ptilopteris triptera var. subpinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf cliff fern, characterized by its finely divided, subpinnate fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, coastal or maritime environments, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps them withstand harsh coastal conditions. It is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies on cliffs and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in temperate regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and along the western coasts of Canada.</p>
