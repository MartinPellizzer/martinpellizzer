                    <h1>Peridium coccineum</h1>
<p>Peridium coccineum, commonly known as the red peridium, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red, fleshy perianth that resembles a capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats and has a compact, shrub-like structure. Its flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant produces small, hard seeds within the perianth.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Cactaceae, although it is not a true cactus.</p>
