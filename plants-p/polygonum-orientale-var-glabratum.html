<p>Polygonum orientale var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glabrous (smooth) leaves that are typically bright green and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to reddish in color, arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodlands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
