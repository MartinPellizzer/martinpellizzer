<p>Paronychia monticola, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Paronychia monticola typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its compact form and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a resilient member of its ecosystem.</p>
