<p>Potamogeton × nitens f. perfoliatifolius, commonly known as the perfoliate-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive perfoliate leaves, which are pierced by the stems, creating a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. It has slender, branching stems that often float at the water's surface, with small, greenish-white flowers appearing in spike-like clusters.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability and is often found in nutrient-rich waters where it can form dense vegetation.</p>
