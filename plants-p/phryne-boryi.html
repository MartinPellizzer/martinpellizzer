                    <h1>Phryne boryi</h1>
<p>Phryne boryi, commonly known as the Bory's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent petals that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic habit, and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale pink, with a delicate, almost ethereal fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Phryne boryi is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
