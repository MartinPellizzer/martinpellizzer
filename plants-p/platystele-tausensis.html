                    <h1>Platystele tausensis</h1>
<p>Platystele tausensis, commonly known as the Tauson's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
