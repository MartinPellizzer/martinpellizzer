                    <h1>Pteris aquilina var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Pteris aquilina var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a soft, pubescent layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
