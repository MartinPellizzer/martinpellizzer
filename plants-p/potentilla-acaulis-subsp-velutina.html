<p>Potentilla acaulis subsp.</p>
<p>velutina, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
