                    <h1>Pedicularis transversa</h1>
<p>Pedicularis transversa, commonly known as the Transverse Lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, often arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Pedicularis transversa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>
