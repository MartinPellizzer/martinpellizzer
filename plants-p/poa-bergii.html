<p>Poa bergii, commonly known as the Berg's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Poa bergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky or marginal environments.</p>
