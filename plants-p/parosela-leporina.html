                    <h1>Parosela leporina</h1>
<p>Parosela leporina, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that resemble the paw prints of a hare. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or forest floors. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela leporina is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
