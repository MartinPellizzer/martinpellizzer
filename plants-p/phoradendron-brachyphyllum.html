                    <h1>Phoradendron brachyphyllum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, while also potentially affecting the health of its host tree.</p>
