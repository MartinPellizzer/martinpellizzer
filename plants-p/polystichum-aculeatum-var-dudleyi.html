                    <h1>Polystichum aculeatum var. dudleyi</h1>
<p>Polystichum aculeatum var. dudleyi, commonly known as Dudley's holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form thick mats in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings.</p>
