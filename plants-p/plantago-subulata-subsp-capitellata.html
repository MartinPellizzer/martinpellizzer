<p>Plantago subulata subsp.</p>
<p>capitellata, commonly known as the mountain plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and for its traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>
