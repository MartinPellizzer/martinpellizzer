                    <h1>Pyrrhotrichia</h1>
<p>Pyrrhotrichia, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. Pyrrhotrichia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to their ancient lineage, they are considered living fossils and offer insights into early plant evolution.</p>
