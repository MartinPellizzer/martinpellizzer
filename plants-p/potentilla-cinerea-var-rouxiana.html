                    <h1>Potentilla cinerea var. rouxiana</h1>
<p>Potentilla cinerea var. rouxiana, commonly known as the gray cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
