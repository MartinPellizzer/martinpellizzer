<p>Polypodium setuliferum, commonly known as the hairy polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky substrates, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
