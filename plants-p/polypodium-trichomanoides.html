<p>Polypodium trichomanoides, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are distinguishable from the sterile fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium trichomanoides plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
