<p>Pitcairnia funkiae, commonly known as the silver star bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving the plant its distinctive silvery appearance. It produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in the late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
