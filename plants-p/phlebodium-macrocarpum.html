                    <h1>Phlebodium macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Phlebodium macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant bird's nest fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in diameter. The plant has a distinctive central rosette of sterile fronds that form a cup-like structure, which collects water and debris. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Phlebodium macrocarpum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
