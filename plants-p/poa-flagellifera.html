                    <h1>Poa flagellifera</h1>
<p>Poa flagellifera, commonly known as the flagellate bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Poa flagellifera is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
