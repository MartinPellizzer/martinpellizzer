                    <h1>Poa laxa var. debilior</h1>
<p>Poa laxa var. debilior, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps and has fine, slender blades that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological restoration projects in wetland habitats.</p>
