<p>Pinus flexilis var. albicaulis, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the flexible pine native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white bark, which becomes more pronounced with age, and its serotinous cones that release seeds following fire or extreme heat. The tree typically grows in high-elevation forests and is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions. Its needles are long and bluish-green, and it produces edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and vulnerability to pests and climate change, it is a subject of conservation interest.</p>
