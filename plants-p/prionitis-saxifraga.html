<p>Prionitis saxifraga, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, silky layer of hair. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
