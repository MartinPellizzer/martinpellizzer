                    <h1>Pyrus scabiosa</h1>
<p>Pyrus scabiosa, commonly known as rough pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pomes that ripen in late summer. Pyrus scabiosa is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
