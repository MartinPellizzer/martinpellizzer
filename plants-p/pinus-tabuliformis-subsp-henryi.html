<p>Pinus tabuliformis subsp.</p>
<p>henryi, commonly known as the Henry pine, is a subspecies of the Chinese pine native to mountainous regions in northern China. It is characterized by its conical shape, needle-like leaves, and distinctive reddish-brown bark that develops fissures with age.</p>
<p>The tree produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. It is adapted to cold and dry climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The subspecies is often used in reforestation efforts due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
