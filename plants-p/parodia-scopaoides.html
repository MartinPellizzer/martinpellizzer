<p>Parodia scopaoides, commonly known as the "Cushion Cactus," is a species native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit, with short, cylindrical stems that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Parodia scopaoides is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
