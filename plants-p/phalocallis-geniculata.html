                    <h1>Phalocallis geniculata</h1>
<p>Phalocallis geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a succulent plant native to the deserts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, twisting stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. It has spines and is adapted to survive in hot, dry climates with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its striking form and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts and xeriscaping.</p>
