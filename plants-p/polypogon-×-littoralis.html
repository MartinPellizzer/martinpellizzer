                    <h1>Polypogon × littoralis</h1>
<p>Polypogon × littoralis, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it tolerate coastal conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Polypogon × littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
