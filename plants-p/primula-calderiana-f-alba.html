<p>Primula calderiana f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered calderian primrose, is a rare and striking member of the Primulaceae family.</p>
<p>This alpine plant is characterized by its pale to white, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions of China. The plant features a short, hairy stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
