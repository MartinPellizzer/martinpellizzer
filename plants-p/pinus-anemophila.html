                    <h1>Pinus anemophila</h1>
<p>Pinus anemophila, commonly known as the creeping foxtail pine, is a species of pine native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, a key adaptation for its habitat. Its needles are typically blue-green in color and remain on the plant for several years.</p>
<p>This species is often found in high-altitude regions and is notable for its resilience in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
