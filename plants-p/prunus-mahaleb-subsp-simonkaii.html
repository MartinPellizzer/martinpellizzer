<p>Prunus mahaleb subsp.</p>
<p>simonkaii, commonly known as the Chinese cherry or Chinese mahaleb, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and Korea. It typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters, featuring slender branches and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart red drupes that are often consumed fresh or processed into jams. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to the typical P. mahaleb.</p>
