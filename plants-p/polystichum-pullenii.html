<p>Polystichum pullenii, commonly known as the Pullen's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum pullenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
