<p>Phyllorkis antennifera, commonly known as the slender green alga, is a marine organism belonging to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, ribbon-like thallus that can vary in color from green to brown depending on environmental conditions. This species typically grows on rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters, where it thrives in nutrient-rich environments. Its structure consists of a single layer of cells, making it relatively simple in morphology compared to more complex algae.</p>
<p>Phyllorkis antennifera plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
