                    <h1>Potentilla crantzii var. stricticaulis</h1>
<p>Potentilla crantzii var. stricticaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which are attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its hairy stems and bracteate inflorescences.</p>
