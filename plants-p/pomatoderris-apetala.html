<p>Pomatoderris apetala, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>The ghost gum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
