                    <h1>Pitcairnia calderonii</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia calderonii, commonly known as the Calder√≥n's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia calderonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
