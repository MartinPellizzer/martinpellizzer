<p>Papyrius papyrifera, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Papyrius papyrifera plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
