<p>Pereskia ochnacarpa, commonly known as the Cucurbita-like Pereskia, is a unique cactus species native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that resemble those of a shrub rather than a typical cactus. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored berry that contains numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Despite its cactus classification, it has a more plant-like appearance compared to other members of the Cactaceae family.</p>
