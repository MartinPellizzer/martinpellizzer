                    <h1>Picea torano f. rubriflora</h1>
<p>Picea torano f. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered fir, is a rare and striking variant of the Torano fir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange-red bracts that surround the cone-bearing structures, distinguishing it from typical fir species. This botanical feature is most prominent in the spring, adding a unique visual appeal to its coniferous appearance. The plant is native to specific high-altitude regions in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
