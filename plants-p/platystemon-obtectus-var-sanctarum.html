<p>Platystemon obtectus var. sanctarum, commonly known as the sacred platystemon, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
