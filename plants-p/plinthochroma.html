                    <h1>Plinthochroma</h1>
<p>Plinthochroma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique botanical features include its pale green, leaf-like stems and its delicate, white or greenish-white flowers. Plinthochroma thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
