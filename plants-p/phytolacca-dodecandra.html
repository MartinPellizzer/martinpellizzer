                    <h1>Phytolacca dodecandra</h1>
<p>Phytolacca dodecandra, commonly known as the black nightshade or Indian madder, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark red, fleshy berries. Its roots and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties.</p>
<p>However, the plant is toxic if ingested in large quantities, making it important to handle with care.</p>
