<p>Panicum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian foxtail, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-shaped inflorescences that are typically golden to reddish in color, which contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subarctic conditions.</p>
<p>Siberian foxtail is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
