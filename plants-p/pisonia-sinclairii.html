<p>Pisonia sinclairii, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</p>

The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitats.</p>
