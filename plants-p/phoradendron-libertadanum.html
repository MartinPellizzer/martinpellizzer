<p>Phoradendron libertadanum, commonly known as the Libertador's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the families Fabaceae and Moraceae, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
