<p>Pyrularia pubera, commonly known as the hairy pyrularia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, often umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or wet meadows. Its leaves are hairy, hence the species name "pubera," and its flowers are small and white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Pyrularia pubera is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
