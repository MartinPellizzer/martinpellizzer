<p>Pseudocyclosorus torrentis, commonly known as the torrent moss, is a small, delicate liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky crevices or along streams, where it can access the constant moisture it requires. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop on the upper surface of the thallus and release spores into the air.</p>
<p>Pseudocyclosorus torrentis is an important indicator species for water quality and habitat conditions in its native range.</p>
