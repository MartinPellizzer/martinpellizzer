                    <h1>Platyopuntia nana</h1>
<p>Platyopuntia nana, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, low-growing plant with thick, fleshy stems that store water, a typical adaptation for arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
