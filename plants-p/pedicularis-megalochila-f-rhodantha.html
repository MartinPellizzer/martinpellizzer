                    <h1>Pedicularis megalochila f. rhodantha</h1>
<p>Pedicularis megalochila f. rhodantha, commonly known as the red-lipped monkey orchid, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while photosynthesizing independently. The plant is characterized by its vivid red petals with a distinctive pinkish lip, which plays a key role in attracting pollinators. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, often in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
