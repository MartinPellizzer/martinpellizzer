<p>Pinus strobiformis subsp.</p>
<p>carvajalii, commonly known as the Carvajalâ€™s pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and distinctive cone morphology.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its cones are often reddish-brown and contain two-winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
