                    <h1>Psilopsis</h1>
<p>Psilopsis, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. Psilopsis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many ancient plant groups.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ancient lineage provide valuable insights into the evolution of early terrestrial plants.</p>
