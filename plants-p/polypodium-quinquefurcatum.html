<p>Polypodium quinquefurcatum, commonly known as the five-branched water fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into five main branches, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
