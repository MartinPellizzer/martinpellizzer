<p>Pinus edulis var. fallax, commonly known as the Apache pine, is a variant of the pinyon pine native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, edible cones that produce seeds valued by both wildlife and humans. The tree typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage. Its needle-like leaves are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to other pine species.</p>
<p>The plant plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert species.</p>
