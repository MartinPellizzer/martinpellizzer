                    <h1>Pogonia mantiqueirae var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Pogonia mantiqueirae var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are short and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
