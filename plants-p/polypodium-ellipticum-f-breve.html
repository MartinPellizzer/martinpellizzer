<p>Polypodium ellipticum f. breve, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a compact and low-growing fern species native to various regions of the world, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices, forest floors, and mountainous areas. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often shorter than those of the typical variety, giving it a more compact appearance. Its rhizome system is well-developed, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates and absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
