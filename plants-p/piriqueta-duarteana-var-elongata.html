                    <h1>Piriqueta duarteana var. elongata</h1>
<p>Piriqueta duarteana var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated piriqueta, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the dry season, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
