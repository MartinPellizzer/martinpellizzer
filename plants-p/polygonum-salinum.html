<p>Polygonum salinum, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Polygonaceae family. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and saline soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
