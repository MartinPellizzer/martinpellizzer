<p>Polygonum fluitans f. hartwrightii, commonly known as the floating knotweed.</p>
<p>This variant is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating on the water surface, with some leaves submerged. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, attracting various pollinators.</p>
