                    <h1>Pediocactus bradyi var. winkleri</h1>
<p>Pediocactus bradyi var. winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's barrel cactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in spines and a dense, woolly coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
