<p>Paspalum validum, commonly known as broadleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and wide, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
