<p>Paraprasophyllum constrictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf paraprasophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the short growing season in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
