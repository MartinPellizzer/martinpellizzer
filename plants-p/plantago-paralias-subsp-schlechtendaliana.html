<p>Plantago paralias subsp.</p>
<p>schlechtendaliana, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh maritime conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal succession.</p>
