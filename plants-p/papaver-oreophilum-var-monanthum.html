                    <h1>Papaver oreophilum var. monanthum</h1>
<p>Papaver oreophilum var. monanthum, commonly known as the single-flowered poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from deep red to orange, with a distinctive papery texture. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its reduced floral structure, featuring a single pistil and stamen, which distinguishes it from other varieties within the species.</p>
