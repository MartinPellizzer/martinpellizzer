                    <h1>Palaquium canaliculatum</h1>
<p>Palaquium canaliculatum, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red berries. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming part of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important species for coastal stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
