<p>Polystichum braunii var. purshii, commonly known as the Pursh's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, lanceolate shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are often divided into numerous pinnae, giving the plant a lush, fern-like appearance.</p>
