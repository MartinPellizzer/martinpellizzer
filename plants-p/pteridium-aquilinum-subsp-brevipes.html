<p>Pteridium aquilinum subsp.</p>
<p>brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed bracken, is a fern species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical bracken. It produces fertile fronds with sporangia on the underside, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is widely distributed across temperate regions and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
