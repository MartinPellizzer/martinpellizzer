<p>Pinguicula vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, emerging on slender stalks above the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its longer leaves compared to other members of the Pinguicula genus.</p>
