                    <h1>Pinus inops</h1>
<p>Pinus inops, commonly known as the sparse pine, is a rare and little-known species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and small, clustered cones. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to other pine species. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, dry climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus inops is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
