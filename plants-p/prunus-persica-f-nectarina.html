<p>Prunus persica f. nectarina, commonly known as the nectarine, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its smooth, fuzzy skin and sweet, juicy flesh.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to the peach (Prunus persica), differing mainly in its lack of a fuzzy coating on the skin. The flowers are typically pink or white, and the fruit develops from a single ovary, ripening in late summer.</p>
<p>Nectarines are prized for their flavor and are often used in both fresh consumption and culinary applications.</p>
