<p>Phagnalon rupestre subsp.</p>
<p>rupestre, commonly known as the rock phagnalon, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky slopes or gravelly ground.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
