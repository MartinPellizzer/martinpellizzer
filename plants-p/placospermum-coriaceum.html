<p>Placospermum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stem is often branched and can grow up to several feet in height, making it a striking addition to rock gardens.</p>
<p>Placospermum coriaceum is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
