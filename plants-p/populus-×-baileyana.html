                    <h1>Populus × baileyana</h1>
<p>Populus × baileyana, commonly known as the river birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white birch (Populus tremuloides) and the black birch (Populus nigra). The tree is characterized by its exfoliating bark, which peels in thin, papery layers to reveal a mottled pattern of white, pink, and cinnamon tones. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and streamside habitats.</p>
