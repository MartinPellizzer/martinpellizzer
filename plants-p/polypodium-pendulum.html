                    <h1>Polypodium pendulum</h1>
<p>Polypodium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features a compact, upright frond with a distinctive, drooping appearance, giving it its common name. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique characteristic makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a popular ornamental plant in shaded gardens.</p>
