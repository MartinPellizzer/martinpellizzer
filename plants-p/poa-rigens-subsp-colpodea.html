<p>Poa rigens subsp.</p>
<p>colpodea, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that reflects its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes, often forming dense mats in alpine meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance in stabilizing alpine soils, it is a key component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
