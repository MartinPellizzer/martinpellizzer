                            <h1>Plantago Durvillei Var. Latifolia</h1>
<p>Broadleaf plantain, scientifically known as Plantago durvillei var. latifolia, is a hardy perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. This species thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its broad, waxy leaves are adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
