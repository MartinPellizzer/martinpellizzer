                    <h1>Phoradendron macrotomum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron macrotomum, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of oak and other broadleaf trees.</p>
<p>It has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds. Its root system forms haustoria that penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is native to the southeastern United States and is often found in humid, forested environments.</p>
