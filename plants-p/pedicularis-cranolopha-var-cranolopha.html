                    <h1>Pedicularis cranolopha var. cranolopha</h1>
<p>Pedicularis cranolopha var. cranolopha, commonly known as the purple monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with a unique, elongated labellum. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
