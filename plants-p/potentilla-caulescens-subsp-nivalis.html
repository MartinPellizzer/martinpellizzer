<p>Potentilla caulescens subsp.</p>
<p>nivalis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features slender, prostrate stems covered in dense, silvery-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with a similar pubescent layer, providing insulation against freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky, mountainous habitats and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra.</p>
