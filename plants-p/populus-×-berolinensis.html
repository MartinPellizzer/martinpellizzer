<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse seeds via wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted for its ornamental value and fast growth rate.</p>
<p>Populus × berolinensis is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution.</p>
