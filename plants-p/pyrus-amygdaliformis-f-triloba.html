<p>Pyrus amygdaliformis f. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed pear, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the pear tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a pear. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruit that is typically smaller and more acidic than standard pears. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial shade.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is valued for its unusual foliage and is often grown in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
