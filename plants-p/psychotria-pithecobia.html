                    <h1>Psychotria pithecobia</h1>
<p>Psychotria pithecobia, commonly known as the primate's poison or monkey's poison, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are highly toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores, though it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
