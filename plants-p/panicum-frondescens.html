<p>Panicum frondescens, commonly known as the fronded panicgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, panicle-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Panicum frondescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
