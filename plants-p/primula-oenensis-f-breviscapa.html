<p>Primula oenensis f. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed primrose, is a unique hybrid form of the primula genus native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often pale or bluish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps it withstand colder temperatures. The plant thrives in well-drained, moist soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated by horticulturists for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
