                    <h1>Potamogeton × nitens f. subtilis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × nitens f. subtilis, commonly known as the fine-leaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, elongated leaves.</p>
<p>It is typically found in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or floating, facilitating pollination by water currents. Its leaves are often more delicate and finely textured compared to other species in the genus.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
