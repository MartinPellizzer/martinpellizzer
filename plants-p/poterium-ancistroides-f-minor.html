                    <h1>Poterium ancistroides f. minor</h1>
<p>Poterium ancistroides f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in xerophytic gardens.</p>
