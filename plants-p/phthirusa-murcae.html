                    <h1>Phthirusa murcae</h1>
<p>Phthirusa murcae, commonly known as the wall lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungal partner and a cyanobacterial or algal partner.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on stone or wood surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the intertwined partners. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
