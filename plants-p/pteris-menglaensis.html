<p>Pteris menglaensis, commonly known as the Mengla water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a light green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
