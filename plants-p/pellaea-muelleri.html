<p>Pellaea muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's spikemoss, is a member of the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the upper surfaces of the leaves.</p>
<p>Pellaea muelleri is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats.</p>
