                    <h1>Pedilonum trachyphyllum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum trachyphyllum, commonly known as the rough-leaved pedilonum, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in harsh environments.</p>
