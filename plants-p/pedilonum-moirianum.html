                    <h1>Pedilonum moirianum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum moirianum, commonly known as the Moirian's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that encloses the reproductive structures, a feature typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pedilonum moirianum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
