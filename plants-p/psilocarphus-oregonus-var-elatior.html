<p>Psilocarphus oregonus var. elatior, commonly known as the Oregon psilocybin mushroom, is a species of psychedelic mushroom native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenogastraceae and is characterized by its cap, which ranges from white to pale yellow when young, turning a darker hue as it matures. The gills are initially white and develop a pale yellow color as the mushroom ages. It contains psychoactive compounds such as psilocybin and psilocin, which are responsible for its hallucinogenic effects.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in coniferous forests and is closely related to other psilocybin-containing species in the genus Psilocarphus.</p>
