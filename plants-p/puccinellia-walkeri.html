<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry fields, and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
