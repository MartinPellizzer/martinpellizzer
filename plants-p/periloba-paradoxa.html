                    <h1>Periloba paradoxa</h1>
<p>Periloba paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical nightshade, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking bioluminescent leaves that glow faintly under moonlight, a feature that sets it apart from most other flora. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, and its fruit is a toxic, orange-red berry. Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, Periloba paradoxa is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
<p>Its botanical study offers insights into evolutionary adaptations in low-light environments.</p>
