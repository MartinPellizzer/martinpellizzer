                    <h1>Ptelea trifoliata var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Ptelea trifoliata var. heterophylla, commonly known as the threeleaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with trifoliate leaves in some parts of the plant and simple leaves in others, giving it the species name *heterophylla*. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are alternate, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a type of winged seed, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
