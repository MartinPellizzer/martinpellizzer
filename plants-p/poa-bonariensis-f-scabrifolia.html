                    <h1>Poa bonariensis f. scabrifolia</h1>
<p>Poa bonariensis f. scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical smooth-leafed form. The plant produces dense, tufted growth with slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes.</p>
