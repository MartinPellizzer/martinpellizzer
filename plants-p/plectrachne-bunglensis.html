<p>Plectrachne bunglensis, commonly known as the Bungla grass, is a species of grass native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute flowers, typical of the grass family. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora.</p>
