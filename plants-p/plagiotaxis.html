                    <h1>Plagiotaxis</h1>
<p>Plagiotaxis, commonly known as the heliotropic growth habit, refers to the ability of certain plants to orient their stems or leaves toward a light source.</p>
<p>This phototropic response is primarily driven by the plant hormone auxin, which accumulates on the shaded side of the stem, causing differential growth. Plagiotaxis is commonly observed in plants such as sunflowers and certain species of vines. It allows the plant to maximize photosynthesis by positioning its leaves optimally for light absorption.</p>
<p>This growth behavior is an adaptive strategy that enhances the plant's survival and growth in varying light conditions.</p>
