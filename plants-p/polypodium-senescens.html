<p>Polypodium senescens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and ability to climb using its fronds. The plant features bi-lobed, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter.
