<p>Paspalum edmondii, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it a common species in dune ecosystems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often inconspicuous. It is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Paspalum edmondii is also used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
