                    <h1>Phoradendron microps</h1>
<p>Phoradendron microps, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of various host trees, such as oaks and pines, and relies on them for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its leaves are scale-like, and it lacks true roots, instead forming haustoria to attach to the host.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
