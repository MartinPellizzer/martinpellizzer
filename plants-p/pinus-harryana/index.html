                            <h1>Pinus Harryana</h1>
<p>Pinus harryana, also known as Harry's pine, is a rare and unique conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. This evergreen tree is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and distinctive cone structure. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are essential to ensure its survival in the face of environmental threats.</p>
