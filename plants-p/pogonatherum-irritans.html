                    <h1>Pogonatherum irritans</h1>
<p>Pogonatherum irritans, commonly known as the prickly grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, bristly leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils effectively.</p>
<p>Pogonatherum irritans is often found in open areas, lawns, and along roadsides, where it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
