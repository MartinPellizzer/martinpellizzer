                    <h1>Packera hesperia</h1>
<p>Packera hesperia, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine zones. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, windy environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellow, appearing in late summer, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
