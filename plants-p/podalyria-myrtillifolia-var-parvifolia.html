<p>Podalyria myrtillifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf willow-leaf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
