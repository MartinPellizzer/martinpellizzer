                    <h1>Phalaris coerulescens var. concolor</h1>
<p>Phalaris coerulescens var. concolor, commonly known as bluegrass or coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities and aesthetic appeal.</p>
