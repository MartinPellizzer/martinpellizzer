                    <h1>Paspalum swallenii</h1>
<p>Paspalum swallenii, commonly known as the swamp paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy or waterlogged soils and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland vegetation, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to thrive in saturated conditions, it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wetland species.</p>
