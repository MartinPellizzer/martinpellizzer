<p>Potamogeton montanensis, commonly known as mountain pondweed, is a freshwater aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Potamogeton montanensis is also used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
