<p>Polygonum × figertii, commonly known as the hybrid knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively.

It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions.</p>
