<p>Picea koyamae, commonly known as the Koyama spruce, is a rare and endemic conifer native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
