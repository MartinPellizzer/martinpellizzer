                    <h1>Potentilla fruticosa f. floribunda</h1>
<p>Potentilla fruticosa f. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering cinquefoil, is a compact, shrubby plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features dense, woody stems that are often covered in a layer of white, woolly hairs, providing insulation against harsh cold. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptical, with finely toothed margins and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>This frost-tolerant species is well adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments.</p>
