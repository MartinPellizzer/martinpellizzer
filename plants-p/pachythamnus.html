<p>Pachythamnus, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees adapted to coastal and sandy environments. The plants are characterized by their yellow flowers, which are clustered in spikes and attract various pollinators. Pachythamnus species typically have small, leathery leaves and are well-suited to withstand salty air and strong winds.</p>
<p>They play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
