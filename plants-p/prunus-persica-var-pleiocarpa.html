The flowers are typically pink to white, and the fruits are smaller than standard peaches, often with a more intense flavor. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary use, though it is less commonly cultivated commercially.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
