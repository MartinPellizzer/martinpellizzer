                    <h1>Platystele ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Platystele ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the humid air. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, and it produces tiny, short-lived seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Platystele ovalifolia is considered endangered and is often found in cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
