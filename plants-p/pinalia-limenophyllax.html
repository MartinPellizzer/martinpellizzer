                    <h1>Pinalia limenophyllax</h1>
<p>Pinalia limenophyllax, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pinalia limenophyllax is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
