                    <h1>Pentatherum pilosulum</h1>
<p>Pentatherum pilosulum, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive some of its nutrients from the host tree, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife.</p>
