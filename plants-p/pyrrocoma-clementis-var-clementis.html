<p>Pyrrocoma clementis var. clementis, commonly known as the Clementine Pyrrocoma, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often resembling those of citrus fruits. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
