<p>Panicum microphyllum, commonly known as littleleaf panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains of pollen. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
