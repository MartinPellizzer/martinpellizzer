                    <h1>Pseudosarcolobus villosus</h1>
<p>Pseudosarcolobus villosus, commonly known as the hairy pseudosarcolobus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, pale flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
