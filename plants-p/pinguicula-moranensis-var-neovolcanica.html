                    <h1>Pinguicula moranensis var. neovolcanica</h1>
<p>Pinguicula moranensis var. neovolcanica, commonly known as the Neovolcanic butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically small and pink or purple, appearing on stalks above the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
