<p>Pitcairnia camptocalyx var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in a dense, spike-like inflorescence, adding a bold visual impact to its foliage. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that form a rosette, capable of collecting and retaining water, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
