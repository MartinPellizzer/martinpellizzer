                    <h1>Phoradendron macrophyllum var. jonesii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron macrophyllum var. jonesii, commonly known as the Jones' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as oaks and hickories, using a specialized root system called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects while also influencing the growth of its host trees.</p>
