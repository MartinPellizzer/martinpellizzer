<p>Pyrrosia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a narrow, elongated shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Pyrrosia stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
