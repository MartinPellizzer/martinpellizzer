                    <h1>Prinsepia uniflora var. serrata</h1>
<p>Prinsepia uniflora var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated prinsepia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
