<p>Pilocopiapoa solaris, commonly known as the sun cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white to pale green spines that provide protection from intense sunlight and predators. The plant produces yellow flowers during the brief rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Pilocopiapoa solaris is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
