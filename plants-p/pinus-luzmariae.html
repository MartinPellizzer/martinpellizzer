                    <h1>Pinus luzmariae</h1>
<p>Pinus luzmariae, commonly known as the Luzmaria pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Luzon in the Philippines.</p>
<p>This coniferous tree is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. It produces small, dark purple cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Pinus luzmariae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
