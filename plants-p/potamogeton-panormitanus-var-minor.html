                    <h1>Potamogeton panormitanus var. minor</h1>
<p>Potamogeton panormitanus var. minor, commonly known as the minor pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often submerged or just at the water's surface. It plays a vital role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
