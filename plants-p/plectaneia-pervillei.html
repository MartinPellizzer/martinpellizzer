                    <h1>Plectaneia pervillei</h1>
<p>Plectaneia pervillei, commonly known as the Perville's plectanea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and cool climates. Its flowers, which are usually pale blue or violet, bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plectaneia pervillei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
