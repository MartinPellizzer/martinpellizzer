<p>Panax heyneanus, commonly known as the Heyne's ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by red berries. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are valued for their potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
