                    <h1>Pinus macvaughii</h1>
<p>Pinus macvaughii, commonly known as the MacVaugh's pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces distinctive cones that are often reddish-brown and can remain closed for several years before opening to release its seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
