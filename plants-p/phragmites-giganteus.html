                    <h1>Phragmites giganteus</h1>
<p>Phragmites giganteus, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It forms dense stands in shallow water and moist soil, often along the edges of lakes, rivers, and marshes. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind. Its rhizomes spread extensively, allowing it to dominate aquatic habitats and sometimes outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies in some regions, it plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
