<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, bright green leaves.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
