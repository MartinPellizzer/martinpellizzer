                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. sagnitziensis</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. sagnitziensis, commonly known as the Sagnitz dwarf spruce, is a naturally occurring variant of the white spruce.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more densely packed needles compared to the typical white spruce. This form is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticultural collections.</p>
