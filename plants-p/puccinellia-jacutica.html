                    <h1>Puccinellia jacutica</h1>
<p>Puccinellia jacutica, commonly known as the Siberian glassworts, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the cold regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects in degraded habitats.</p>
