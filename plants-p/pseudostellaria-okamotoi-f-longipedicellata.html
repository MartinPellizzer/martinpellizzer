                    <h1>Pseudostellaria okamotoi f. longipedicellata</h1>
<p>Pseudostellaria okamotoi f. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stalked pseudostellaria, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its elongated pedicels.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is native to specific regions in East Asia. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, dark green leaves. Its morphology is distinct due to the extended stalks supporting its inflorescence, which sets it apart from other forms of Pseudostellaria.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits.</p>
