                    <h1>Polystichum dracomontanum</h1>
<p>Polystichum dracomontanum, commonly known as the dragon's blood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, moist soil.</p>
<p>The name "dragon's blood" is believed to reference the reddish color of its spores, which resemble dried blood.</p>
