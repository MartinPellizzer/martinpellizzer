<p>Phenax aquatica, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow water bodies.</p>
<p>It has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots help stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering pollutants.</p>
<p>Phenax aquatica is an important species for maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems.</p>
