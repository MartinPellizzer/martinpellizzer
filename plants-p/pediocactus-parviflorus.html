                <h1>Pediocactus parviflorus</h1>
<p>Pediocactus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived cactus.</p>
<p>Pediocactus parviflorus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
