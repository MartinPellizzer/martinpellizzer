<p>Primulina tamiana, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically surrounded by a spadix, a common feature in the arum family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation.</p>
