                    <h1>Pinus × rhaetica nothovar. bolosii</h1>
<p>Pinus × rhaetica nothovar. bolosii, commonly known as the Bolosii pine, is a hybrid conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Pinus muricata and Pinus aristata, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in high-elevation environments, such as the Sierra Nevada and the Great Basin. It features needle-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces cones that are elongated and often persist on the tree for several years.</p>
<p>This nothovar is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in mountain ecosystems.</p>
