<p>Pteris cretica var. americana, commonly known as the American water fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands.

<p>The botanical characteristics of this fern make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and wetland restoration projects.</p>
