                    <h1>Pyrus vitis-idaea</h1>
<p>Pyrus vitis-idaea, commonly known as the crowberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils found in boreal and subarctic regions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, red or black berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>The leaves are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its cold, harsh environment.</p>
