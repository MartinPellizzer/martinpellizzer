                    <h1>Paepalanthus mirabilis var. ramosa</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus mirabilis var. ramosa, commonly known as the branched peacock plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble peacock feathers, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic or terrestrial species, with rosette-shaped leaves that collect water and nutrients. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, white or pale flowers, adding to its visual appeal.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'ramosa' distinguishes it by its more branched inflorescence compared to the typical variety.</p>
