<p>Plectronia sclerocarpa, commonly known as the rock cypress, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, protective layer that helps it withstand extreme temperatures and drought.</p>
<p>Plectronia sclerocarpa is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
