<p>Pterophylla lucens, commonly known as the luminous fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant belongs to the family Araliaceae and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces berries that are edible for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, Pterophylla lucens is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
