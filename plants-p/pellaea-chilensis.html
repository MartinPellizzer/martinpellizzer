                <h1>Pellaea chilensis</h1>
<p>Pellaea chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean cliff fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds, typically in late summer. Pellaea chilensis thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to withstand harsh conditions such as salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
