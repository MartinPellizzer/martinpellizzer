<p>Polygonum equisetiforme subsp.</p>
<p>scoparium, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and slender, wiry stems. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is native to parts of Asia and is adapted to moist, disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
