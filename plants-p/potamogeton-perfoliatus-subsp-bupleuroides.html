<p>Potamogeton perfoliatus subsp.</p>
<p>bupleuroides, commonly known as the broadleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its perfoliate leaves, which have a distinct hole in the middle, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
