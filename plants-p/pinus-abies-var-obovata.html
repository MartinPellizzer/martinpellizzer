<p>Pinus abies var. obovata, commonly known as the Norway spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to northern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles that are typically two to three centimeters long, and its distinctive cone-like structures that mature to a reddish-brown color. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, seed-containing structures that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in horticulture and as a source of timber due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
