                    <h1>Phoradendron rubrum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rubrum, commonly known as the scarlet mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks roots of its own and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant's life cycle involves both sexual and asexual reproduction, with seeds often dispersed by birds that eat the berries.</p>
