                    <h1>Pedicularis ernesti-mayeri</h1>
<p>Pedicularis ernesti-mayeri, commonly known as the Mayer's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically red or orange in color, often resembling the appearance of a louse, hence its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
