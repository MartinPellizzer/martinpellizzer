                    <h1>Potentilla anserina var. concolor</h1>
<p>Potentilla anserina var. concolor, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features silvery-white, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to the common potentilla, with the "concolor" suffix indicating that its leaves are uniformly colored.</p>
