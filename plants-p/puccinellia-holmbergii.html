                    <h1>Puccinellia holmbergii</h1>
<p>Puccinellia holmbergii, commonly known as the Holmberg's saltbush, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and bluish-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots stabilize soil and prevent erosion, contributing to ecological resilience in challenging climates.</p>
