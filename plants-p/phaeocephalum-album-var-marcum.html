                    <h1>Phaeocephalum album var. marcum</h1>
<p>Phaeocephalum album var. marcum, commonly known as the white-flowered ghostplant, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white stems and small, translucent leaves that often appear ghostly in water. This variant is distinguished from the typical *Phaeocephalum album* by its lighter coloration and slightly different morphology. It thrives in shallow, still waters with soft, acidic substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
