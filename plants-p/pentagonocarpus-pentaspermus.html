<p>Pentagonocarpus pentaspermus, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hard, dense wood and is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, five-angled fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high wood value, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
