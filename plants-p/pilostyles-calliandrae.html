                    <h1>Pilostyles calliandrae</h1>
<p>Pilostyles calliandrae, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant is notable for its unique, ephemeral flowers that appear only briefly at night, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow. Its reproductive strategy involves producing copious amounts of lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and specialized habitat requirements, Pilostyles calliandrae is considered one of the most mysterious plants in the botanical world.</p>
