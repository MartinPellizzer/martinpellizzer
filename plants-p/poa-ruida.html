<p>Poa ruida, commonly known as the rough meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and grasslands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, bract-bearing flower clusters.</p>
<p>Poa ruida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
