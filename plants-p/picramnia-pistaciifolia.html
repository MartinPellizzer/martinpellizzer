<p>Picramnia pistaciifolia, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as Acacia and Eucalyptus, deriving some of its nutrients from the host. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
