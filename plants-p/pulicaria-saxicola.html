                    <h1>Pulicaria saxicola</h1>
<p>Pulicaria saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola wormwood, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, limestone soils and is well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Pulicaria saxicola produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
