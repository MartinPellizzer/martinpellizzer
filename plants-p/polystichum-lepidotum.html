                    <h1>Polystichum lepidotum</h1>
<p>Polystichum lepidotum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, silvery scales, giving it a shimmering appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The silver fern is not only an ornamental plant but also holds cultural significance in MƒÅori traditions.</p>
