                    <h1>Pachycarpus</h1>
<p>Pachycarpus, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often branched stems that store water, a feature typical of plants adapted to arid environments. The leaves are usually small, opposite, and sometimes hairy, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are generally white or yellow and are arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
