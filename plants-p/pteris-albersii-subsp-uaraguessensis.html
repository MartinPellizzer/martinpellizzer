<p>Pteris albersii subsp.</p>
<p>uaraguessensis, commonly known as the Varaguessensis water fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions.</p>
