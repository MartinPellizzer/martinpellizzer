<p>Polypodium gregale, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are leathery and dark green. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium gregale is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
