                    <h1>Platanthera brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Platanthera brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and bogs in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often forms dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
