<p>Peperomia choroniana var. heterodoxa, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>

The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
