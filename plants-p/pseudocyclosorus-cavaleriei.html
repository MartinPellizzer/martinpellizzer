                    <h1>Pseudocyclosorus cavaleriei</h1>
<p>Pseudocyclosorus cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare and ancient aquatic fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a rosette structure, typically with a single central vein. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
