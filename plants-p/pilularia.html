                    <h1>Pilularia</h1>
<p>Pilularia, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures used for capturing tiny aquatic organisms. They are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Pilularia species are often submerged or floating, with slender stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Their unique trapping mechanism makes them important components of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
