                    <h1>Pandiaka schweinfurthii var. glabra</h1>
<p>Pandiaka schweinfurthii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth pandiaka, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that becomes smoother in this particular variety, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
