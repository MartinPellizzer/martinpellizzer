<p>Pectis multiceps, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, bract-like structures that resemble dandelion seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep taproots and succulent leaves.</p>
<p>Pectis multiceps is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
