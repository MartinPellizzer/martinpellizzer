                    <h1>Polypodium sessilifolium var. lobulatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium sessilifolium var. lobulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf rock fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The leaves are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole, and have a distinctive lobed or toothed margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, rocky habitats.</p>
