The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in spikelets, often found near the water's surface. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable ecological component and a potential weed in managed water bodies.</p>
