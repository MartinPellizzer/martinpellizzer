                    <h1>Patzkea patula</h1>
<p>Patzkea patula, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it stay buoyant and supports its massive leaves. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom at night and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Patzkea patula plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
