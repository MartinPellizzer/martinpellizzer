                    <h1>Pycnoneurum junciforme</h1>
<p>Pycnoneurum junciforme, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikes at the tips of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Pycnoneurum junciforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity.</p>
