                    <h1>Polyactium radulifolium</h1>
<p>Polyactium radulifolium, commonly known as the radulifolium fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that resemble delicate lace. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polyactium radulifolium is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
