                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus vexatus</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus vexatus, commonly known as the red-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded stems that are often covered in spines of varying lengths. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti adapted to water scarcity.</p>
<p>Pyrrhocactus vexatus is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
