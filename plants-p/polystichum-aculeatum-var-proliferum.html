                    <h1>Polystichum aculeatum var. proliferum</h1>
<p>Polystichum aculeatum var. proliferum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a hardy evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, leathery fronds with a dense covering of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
