                    <h1>Pteridium aquilinum f. longipes</h1>
<p>Pteridium aquilinum f. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bracken, is a fern characterized by its tall, robust fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features a stout, creeping rhizome that produces large, triangular, and often bipinnate fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest clearings.</p>
