                    <h1>Phoradendron longissimum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron longissimum, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the tropics.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized roots called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health and growth of its host tree.</p>
