<p>Phalaris truncata var. villiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its distinctive, truncate (cut-off) lemma at the base of each floret, which contributes to its scientific name.</p>
