<p>Picea montana, commonly known as the mountain fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-elevation forests, where it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The tree has a tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, with needle-like leaves that are short and dark green. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Picea montana plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native mountainous environment.</p>
