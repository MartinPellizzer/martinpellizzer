                    <h1>Phoradendron zelayanum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron zelayanum, commonly known as the Zelaya mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Neotropical region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing both host trees and avian populations.</p>
