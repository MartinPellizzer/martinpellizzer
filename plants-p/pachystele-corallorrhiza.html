                    <h1>Pachystele corallorrhiza</h1>
<p>Pachystele corallorrhiza, commonly known as the coral-root ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition. The plant's roots are specialized to form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, allowing it to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered, often resembling coral in appearance, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
