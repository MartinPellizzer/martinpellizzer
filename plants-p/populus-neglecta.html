                    <h1>Populus neglecta</h1>
<p>Populus neglecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of other poplar species. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
