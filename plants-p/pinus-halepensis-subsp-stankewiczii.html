<p>Pinus halepensis subsp.</p>
<p>stankewiczii, commonly known as the Aleppo pine subspecies Stankewiczii, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical Aleppo pine.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are generally smaller and more elongated, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
