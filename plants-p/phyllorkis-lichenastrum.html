                    <h1>Phyllorkis lichenastrum</h1>
<p>Phyllorkis lichenastrum, commonly known as the desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and rocky environments, where it forms a crust-like structure on soil surfaces. The algal component provides photosynthesis, while the fungal partner offers structural support and protection. This lichen is capable of surviving extreme desiccation and can remain dormant for long periods.</p>
<p>Its ability to colonize harsh environments makes it an important indicator of soil stability and ecological resilience.</p>
