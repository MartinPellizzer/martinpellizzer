                    <h1>Peltapteris flabellata</h1>
<p>Peltapteris flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leafed fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Marattiopsida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped fronds that were likely used for photosynthesis in swampy environments. The plant's structure includes a short, thick rhizome with a complex system of roots and vascular tissue. Fossil records indicate that it thrived during the Carboniferous period, contributing to the formation of coal deposits.</p>
<p>Its morphology suggests it was a significant component of ancient tropical ecosystems.</p>
