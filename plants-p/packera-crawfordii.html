                    <h1>Packera crawfordii</h1>
<p>Packera crawfordii, commonly known as Crawford's sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are yellow and produce small seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
