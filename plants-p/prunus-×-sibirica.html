                    <h1>Prunus × sibirica</h1>
<p>Prunus × sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian cherry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus mandshurica and Prunus pensylvanica.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3–6 meters. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dark red or black cherry-like drupe, which is edible but not as widely cultivated as other cherry species.</p>
