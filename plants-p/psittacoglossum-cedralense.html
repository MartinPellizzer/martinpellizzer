<p>Psittacoglossum cedralense, commonly known as the Cedralense Pteridium, is a species of fern native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy structures, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
