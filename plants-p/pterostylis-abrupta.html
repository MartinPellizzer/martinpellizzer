                    <h1>Pterostylis abrupta</h1>
<p>Pterostylis abrupta, commonly known as the abrupt helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped floral structure, which is typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, which is often partially hidden beneath a leaf-like bract. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys.</p>
<p>The orchid is pollinated by specific insects, and its reproductive success is closely tied to its ecological niche.</p>
