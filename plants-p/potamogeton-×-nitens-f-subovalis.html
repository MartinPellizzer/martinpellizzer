                    <h1>Potamogeton × nitens f. subovalis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × nitens f. subovalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, suboval leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, giving it a distinct appearance compared to its parent species. The plant thrives in shallow to moderately deep waters, often forming dense underwater stands that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of many pondweeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in slow-moving rivers, lakes, and wetlands, contributing to water clarity and ecosystem stability.</p>
