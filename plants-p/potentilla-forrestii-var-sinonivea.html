                    <h1>Potentilla forrestii var. sinonivea</h1>
<p>Potentilla forrestii var. sinonivea, commonly known as the silky potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance.</p>
