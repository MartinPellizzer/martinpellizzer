                    <h1>Plantago coronopus f. tenuis</h1>
<p>Plantago coronopus f. tenuis, commonly known as narrow-leaved plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows, riverbanks, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a slightly bitter taste, making it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Plantago species and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
