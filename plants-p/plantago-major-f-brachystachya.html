The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, along paths, and in urban environments.</p>
<p>This form is adapted to tolerate various environmental conditions, making it a resilient and widespread plant.</p>
