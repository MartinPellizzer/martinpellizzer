<p>Phleum iranicum, commonly known as Persian barley, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows.</p>
<p>Phleum iranicum is valued for its hardiness and has been used traditionally in pastoral and agricultural settings.</p>
