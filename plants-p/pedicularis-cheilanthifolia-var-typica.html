                    <h1>Pedicularis cheilanthifolia var. typica</h1>
<p>Pedicularis cheilanthifolia var. typica, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the alpine regions of central and southern China, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow petals and sepals, which resemble the fur of a golden monkey, hence its common name. It produces small, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
