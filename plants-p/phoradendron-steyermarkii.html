                    <h1>Phoradendron steyermarkii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, elliptical leaves and white, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
