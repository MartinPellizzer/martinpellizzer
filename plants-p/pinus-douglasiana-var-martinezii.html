                    <h1>Pinus douglasiana var. martinezii</h1>
<p>Pinus douglasiana var. martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's Douglas fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a tall evergreen conifer characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The needles are typically longer and more slender compared to other Douglas fir varieties, and they are arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common reproductive strategy among coniferous trees.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ecological role and is often found in forest ecosystems where it contributes to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
