<p>Pachygenium laurense, commonly known as the Laurense thickstem, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in periodically dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the wet season, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Pachygenium laurense is listed as endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
