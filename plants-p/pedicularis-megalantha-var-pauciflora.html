                    <h1>Pedicularis megalantha var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Pedicularis megalantha var. pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often on the roots of other plants. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred structure. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on haustoria to absorb nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its limited floral display, with only a few flowers per inflorescence.</p>
