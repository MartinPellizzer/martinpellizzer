<p>Pyrethrum balsamita var. tanacetoides, commonly known as tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, button-like flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces a strong, aromatic essential oil that contains compounds like thujone, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Tansy is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent due to its potent chemical composition.</p>
