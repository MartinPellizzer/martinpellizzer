                    <h1>Phyllodes wallisii</h1>
<p>Phyllodes wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's acacia, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like phyllodes that are often mistaken for leaves, though they are actually modified stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom in spring and summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The phyllodes are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
