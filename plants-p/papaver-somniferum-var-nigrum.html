<p>Papaver somniferum var. nigrum, commonly known as black opium poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its dark, almost black蒴果.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically purple or blue, with a distinctive shape and a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant is notable for its latex, which contains alkaloids such as morphine and codeine, making it both economically and medically significant.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, it is heavily regulated in many countries.</p>
