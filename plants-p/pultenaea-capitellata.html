<p>Pultenaea capitellata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bush vetch, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas.</p>
