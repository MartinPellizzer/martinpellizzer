                    <h1>Poa annua var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Poa annua var. tomentosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of a dense layer of hairs on its leaves. This variety is often found in lawns, golf courses, and disturbed soils, where it forms a dense mat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself quickly in various environments.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand foot traffic, making it a popular choice for turfgrass applications.</p>
