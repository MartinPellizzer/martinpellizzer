                    <h1>Pleopeltis plantaginea</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis plantaginea, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to lanceolate fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytic or lithophytic. Its fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
