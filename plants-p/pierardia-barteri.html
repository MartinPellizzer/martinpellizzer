                    <h1>Pierardia barteri</h1>
<p>Pierardia barteri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelion blooms. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in spring, followed by the production of fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Pierardia barteri is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability.</p>
