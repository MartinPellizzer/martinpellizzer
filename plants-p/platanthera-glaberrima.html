<p>Platanthera glaberrima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many regions.</p>
