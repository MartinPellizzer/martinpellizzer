                    <h1>Panicum maximum var. bulbosum</h1>
<p>Panicum maximum var. bulbosum, commonly known as elephant grass, is a tall, robust grass native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green leaves and dense, tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant can grow up to 5 meters in height and is often used as forage for livestock due to its high biomass production. It thrives in wet, humid climates and is commonly found in wetlands and along water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable resource and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
