<p>Phyteuma scorzonerifolium f. umbrofilum, commonly known as the shadowy phyteuma, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage is typically more lush and dense compared to the typical form, adapting to low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
