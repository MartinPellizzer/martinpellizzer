                    <h1>Pacouria pyriformis</h1>
<p>Pacouria pyriformis, commonly known as the pear-shaped spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardening.</p>
