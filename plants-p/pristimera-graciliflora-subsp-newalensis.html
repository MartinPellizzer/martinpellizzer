<p>Pristimera graciliflora subsp.</p>
<p>newalensis, commonly known as the Newalensis spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
