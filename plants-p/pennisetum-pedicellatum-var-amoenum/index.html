<p>Pennisetum pedicellatum var. amoenum, also known as fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass that adds a touch of elegance to gardens and landscapes. With its feathery plumes and soft, bluish-green foliage, it stands out during the growing season and produces delicate, airy seed heads in the fall. Native to Africa, this plant is well adapted to warm climates and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for both novice and experienced gardeners. Whether used as a border plant or in mass plantings, it brings a sense of movement and texture to any outdoor space.</p>
