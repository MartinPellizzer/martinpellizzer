<p>It typically grows in open, grassy areas and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a single leaf and produces a spike of numerous tiny, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to thrive in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils.</p>
