<p>Prunus spinosa subsp.</p>
<p>megalocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited blackthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark green leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by large, dark purple berries. These berries are edible but have a high tannin content, making them less palatable when raw.</p>
<p>The species is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
