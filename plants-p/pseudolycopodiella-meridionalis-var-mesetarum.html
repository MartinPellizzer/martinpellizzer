                    <h1>Pseudolycopodiella meridionalis var. mesetarum</h1>
<p>Pseudolycopodiella meridionalis var. mesetarum, commonly known as the Mesopotamian clubmoss, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a sporophyte that develops into a short, creeping stem. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
