                    <h1>Polypodium serrulatum var. majus</h1>
<p>Polypodium serrulatum var. majus, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a variant of the common polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features fronds that are broad, leathery, and deeply lobed, with serrated margins that give it its scientific name. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its larger size compared to the typical form of Polypodium serrulatum.</p>
