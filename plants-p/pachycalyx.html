                    <h1>Pachycalyx</h1>
<p>Pachycalyx, commonly known as the thick-shelled or thick-cupped plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their robust, thickened calyx that remains attached to the fruit even after maturity. The calyx is often brightly colored and serves as a protective structure for the developing fruit. Pachycalyx species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Their unique botanical features make them interesting subjects for both horticultural study and ecological research.</p>
