                    <h1>Phegopteris lonchodes</h1>
<p>Phegopteris lonchodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for forest health.</p>
