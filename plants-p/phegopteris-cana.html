<p>Phegopteris cana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spore-producing organs located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Phegopteris cana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
