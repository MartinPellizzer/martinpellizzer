                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. inaequilatera</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. inaequilatera, commonly known as the uneven-sided white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped needles and shorter, more clustered cones compared to the typical white spruce. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions, including strong winds and limited sunlight.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in providing habitat for various alpine species and contributing to the biodiversity of mountain ecosystems.</p>
