                    <h1>Phoradendron lineolatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron lineolatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southern United States.</p>
<p>It derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, leading to potential structural damage.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Phoradendron lineolatum plays a role in ecological systems by supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
