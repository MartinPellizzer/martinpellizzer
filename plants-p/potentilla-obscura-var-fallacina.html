<p>Potentilla obscura var. fallacina, commonly known as the dark potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil.</p>
