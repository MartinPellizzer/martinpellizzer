                            <h1>Psoralea Spissa</h1>
<p>Psoralea spissa, scientifically known as Psoralea spissa, is a small, annual legume native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Despite its modest appearance, Psoralea spissa holds ecological significance in its native environment.</p>
