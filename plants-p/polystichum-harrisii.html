<p>Polystichum harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
<p>Polystichum harrisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
