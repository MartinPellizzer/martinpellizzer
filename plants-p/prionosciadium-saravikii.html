<p>Prionosciadium saravikii, commonly known as the Saravik's devil's lettuce, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
