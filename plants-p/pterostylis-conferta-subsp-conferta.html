<p>Pterostylis conferta subsp.</p>
<p>conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, greenish-yellow orchid flower.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted to its scent and appearance.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is listed as vulnerable in some regions due to habitat loss and degradation.</p>
