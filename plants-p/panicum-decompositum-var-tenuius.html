<p>Panicum decompositum var. tenuius, commonly known as narrowleaf dropseed, is a grass species native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, thread-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, pale green or brownish flower spikes that appear in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
