                    <h1>Pleurostachys orbignyana</h1>
<p>Pleurostachys orbignyana, commonly known as the Mexican mountain pine, is a rare and endangered species native to central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, columnar trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is adapted to rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
