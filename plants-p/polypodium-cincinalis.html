<p>Polypodium cincinalis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky surfaces, walls, or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous structure and produces erect, branching fronds with a serrated or lobed leaf blade. Its spores are released from small, fleshy, club-shaped structures called sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium cincinalis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
