<p>Pedicularis przewalskii subsp.</p>
<p>hirsuta, commonly known as the Hirsute Lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Tibet and northern Nepal. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecific name "hirsuta.".</p>
<p>The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
