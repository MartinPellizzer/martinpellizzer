<p>Pleopeltis neoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that often form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in montane forests. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
