<p>Prunus × lannesiana f. fasciculata, commonly known as the dwarf cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub prized for its dense, rounded growth habit.</p>

The plant features small, dark green leaves and produces showy, pink to white flowers in early spring. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for small gardens or containers, and it is often used as a hedge or foundation plant.</p>
<p>The f. fasciculata form is particularly noted for its compact size and ability to maintain a neat, bushy shape with minimal pruning.</p>
