<p>Pittosporum colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's pittosporum, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating.

<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air.</p>
