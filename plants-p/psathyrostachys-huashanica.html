                    <h1>Psathyrostachys huashanica</h1>
<p>Psathyrostachys huashanica, commonly known as the Huashan wild rice, is a grass species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny grains that are similar to those of cultivated rice. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to rice, it has potential significance in agricultural research and breeding programs.</p>
