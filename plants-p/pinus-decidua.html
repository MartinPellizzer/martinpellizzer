                    <h1>Pinus decidua</h1>
<p>Pinus decidua, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Pinus decidua is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
