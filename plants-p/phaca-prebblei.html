                    <h1>Phaca prebblei</h1>
<p>Phaca prebblei, commonly known as the Pebble's phaca, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, contributing to its low profile.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phaca prebblei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
