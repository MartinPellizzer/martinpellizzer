<p>Pleurothyrium immersum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes that anchor it to submerged surfaces, and its fronds are typically broad and slightly curled. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they release spores into the water.</p>
<p>Pleurothyrium immersum plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation.</p>
