                    <h1>Phleum ambiguum</h1>
<p>Phleum ambiguum, commonly known as the variable grass or ambiguous grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize various wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Phleum ambiguum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
