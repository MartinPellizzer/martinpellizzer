<p>Pycreus puncticulatus var. quinquagintiflorus, commonly known as the five-hundred-flower pycreus, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which can number up to 500 per inflorescence, giving it its common name. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
