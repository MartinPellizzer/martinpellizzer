<p>Polypodium bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi-colored, with the upper surface being darker green and the lower surface lighter. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium bicolor is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
