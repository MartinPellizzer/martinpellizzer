                    <h1>Piper mocco-mocco var. angustum</h1>
<p>Piper mocco-mocco var. angustum, commonly known as narrow-leaf mocco-mocco, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant diversity in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
