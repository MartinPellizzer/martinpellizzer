                    <h1>Pierardia macrostachya</h1>
<p>Pierardia macrostachya, commonly known as the giant daylily, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also valued for its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
