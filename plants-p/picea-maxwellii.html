                    <h1>Picea maxwellii</h1>
<p>Picea maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's spruce, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark blue-green needles that are typically 10â€“15 mm long. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
