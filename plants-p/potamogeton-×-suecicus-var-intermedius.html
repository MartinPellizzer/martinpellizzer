<p>Potamogeton × suecicus var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters, such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate good water quality and is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation.</p>
