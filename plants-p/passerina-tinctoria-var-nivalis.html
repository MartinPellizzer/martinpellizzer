                    <h1>Passerina tinctoria var. nivalis</h1>
<p>Passerina tinctoria var. nivalis, commonly known as the snowberry, is a perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early summer, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Its berries are toxic to humans and livestock, making it an important plant to identify in ecological studies.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds, which consume the berries.</p>
