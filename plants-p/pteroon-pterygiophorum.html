<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery coating of trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
