                    <h1>Polypodium alfredii var. curtii</h1>
<p>Polypodium alfredii var. curtii, commonly known as the "Alfred's polypody," is a fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a delicate, clustered frond structure with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish layer of root hairs, which helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other polypody species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
