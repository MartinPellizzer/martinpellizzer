<p>Platanthera gonggana, commonly known as the Chinese lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to China.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a dense, fragrant inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is common among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
