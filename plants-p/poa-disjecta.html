                    <h1>Poa disjecta</h1>
<p>Poa disjecta, commonly known as the scattered bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, dark green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of temperate ecosystems.</p>
