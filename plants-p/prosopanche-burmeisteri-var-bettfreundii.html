<p>Prosopanche burmeisteri var. bettfreundii, commonly known as the Bettfreund's ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in clusters. Native to the Andean regions of South America, it thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
