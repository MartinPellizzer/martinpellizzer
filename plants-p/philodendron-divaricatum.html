<p>Philodendron divaricatum, commonly known as the creeping philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length, often with a deep green to variegated coloration. The plant has a distinctive aerial root system that allows it to climb and attach to surfaces, making it well-suited for hanging baskets or trellises. Its stems are typically slender and can trail or climb depending on the growing conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are often adorned with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native humid environments.</p>
