                    <h1>Pterocactus tuberosus f. lelongii</h1>
<p>Pterocactus tuberosus f. lelongii, commonly known as the Lelong's tuberous cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in smooth, greenish-gray bark that becomes more fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
