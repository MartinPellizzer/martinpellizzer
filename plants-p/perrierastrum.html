                    <h1>Perrierastrum</h1>
<p>Perrierastrum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem that resembles a candle, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, which help minimize surface area for evaporation.</p>
<p>Perrierastrum is well adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
