                            <h1>Potentilla Douglasii</h1>
<p>Douglas' cinquefoil, scientifically known as Potentilla douglasii, is a hardy perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and rugged, shrub-like growth habit, making it well adapted to rocky and arid environments. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions and along dry streambeds. Its common name reflects its historical association with the explorer and botanist Henry David Douglas. Despite its rugged appearance, it is a valuable species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat.</p>
