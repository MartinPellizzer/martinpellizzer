<p>Potamogeton perfoliatus f. acutifolius, commonly known as the sharp-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves with a pointed tip, which distinguish it from other pondweed species. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and forms dense underwater vegetation. Its flowers are small and green, often clustered in spikes, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates.</p>
<p>It is often found in lakes, ponds, and wetlands, contributing to water clarity and oxygenation.</p>
