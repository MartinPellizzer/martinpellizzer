                    <h1>Polypodium sprucei</h1>
<p>Polypodium sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems.</p>
