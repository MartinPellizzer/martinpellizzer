                    <h1>Phymatodes incurvata</h1>
<p>Phymatodes incurvata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round fruits that disperse seeds via wind. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Phymatodes incurvata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
