                    <h1>Paralychnophora harleyi</h1>
<p>Paralychnophora harleyi, commonly known as the Harley's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Paralychnophora harleyi is considered critically endangered.</p>
