                            <h1>Pilosella Lactucella Subsp. Acutisquama</h1>
<p>Pilosella lactucella subsp. acutisquama is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and ecological importance. This subspecies is distinguished by its sharp, pointed leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
