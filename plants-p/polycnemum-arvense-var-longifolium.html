                    <h1>Polycnemum arvense var. longifolium</h1>
<p>Polycnemum arvense var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows, riverbanks, and roadside embankments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues, and it produces small, inconspicuous brownish flowers in spike-like clusters. It is characterized by its robust rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but also serves as a habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
