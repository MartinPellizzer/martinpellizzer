                    <h1>Populus nigra var. maserica</h1>
<p>Populus nigra var. maserica, commonly known as the black poplar or river poplar, is a variant of the black poplar species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its dark, almost black bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, fertile soils near rivers and lakes, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its rapid growth and historical use in timber production.</p>
