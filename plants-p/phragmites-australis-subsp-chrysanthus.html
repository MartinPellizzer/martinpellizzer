<p>Phragmites australis subsp.</p>
<p>chrysanthus, commonly known as the golden reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and long, narrow leaves that often have a golden hue, especially at the base.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to saline and brackish conditions, making it a common inhabitant of coastal marshes and estuaries. Its rhizomatous system allows it to spread rapidly, forming extensive colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant produces fluffy, white plumes that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
