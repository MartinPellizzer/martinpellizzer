                    <h1>Pisum sativum var. pliculum</h1>
<p>Pisum sativum var. pliculum, commonly known as the wrinkled pea, is a variety of the common pea characterized by its distinctive, wrinkled pod and smaller, often curled seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is an annual legume that thrives in temperate climates and is cultivated for both its edible pods and seeds. The wrinkled appearance of its seeds is due to a genetic mutation that affects the starch content and cell structure. It is closely related to other pea varieties and shares similar growth habits, including climbing tendrils and trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>The botanical features of P. sativum var. pliculum make it a valuable subject for genetic and agricultural research.</p>
