<p>Plagiogyria liankwangensis, commonly known as the Liangkang feather moss, is a rare and specialized moss species native to China.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a dense, cushion-like growth form, with delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often curled or twisted. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
