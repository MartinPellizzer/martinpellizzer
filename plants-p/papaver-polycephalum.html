                    <h1>Papaver polycephalum</h1>
<p>Papaver polycephalum, commonly known as the many-headed poppy, is a striking member of the Papaveraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces numerous small, clustered flowers at the top of its stem, giving it its distinctive "many-headed" appearance. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Papaver polycephalum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, papery petals.</p>
