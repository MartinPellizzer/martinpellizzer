<p>Phthirusa orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, foliose thallus that forms a rounded, leaf-like structure. The plant typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>The lichen's structure and physiology make it an important indicator species for environmental health and air quality.</p>
