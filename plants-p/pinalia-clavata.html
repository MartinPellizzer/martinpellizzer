                    <h1>Pinalia clavata</h1>
<p>Pinalia clavata, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. Pinalia clavata typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
