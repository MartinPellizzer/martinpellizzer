<p>Poa nigriflora, commonly known as black-flowered bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast strikingly with its fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and thrives in high-altitude grasslands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Poa nigriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
