                    <h1>Platyloma durum</h1>
<p>Platyloma durum, commonly known as the hard-leaved flat-leaf plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that reduces water loss, an adaptation to its harsh habitat. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in compact umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with mild, dry climates.</p>
