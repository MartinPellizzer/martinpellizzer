<p>Phragmites breviglumis, commonly known as the short-stemmed reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense stands along the edges of lakes, ponds, and marshes, thriving in saturated soils. The plant has tall, hollow stems that are often used as nesting material by waterfowl and other birds. Its narrow, blade-like leaves are usually covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Phragmites breviglumis plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
