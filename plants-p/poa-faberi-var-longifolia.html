                    <h1>Poa faberi var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Poa faberi var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved peat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often longer than those of the typical Poa faberi species. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs or wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
